{"QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and thanks very much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "0_0gj6pZVnQ": "SAY INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD\nCOVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO COVER THE COSTS, SO WE\u2019D LIKE TO\nHEAR FROM YOU IF IT WORKS FOR HEAR FROM YOU IF IT WORKS FOR\nYOU.

It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "q0F5lDf6gkQ": "hi I'm Tanner with nature's ultra in this episode of CBD 101 we're going to talk about how to use CBD and answer some of the common questions about making it part of your daily routine [Applause] [Music] let's start with the easy stuff how to use CBD to use one of our CBD oils you'll want to apply one full dropper to the desired area if you're using our CBD muscle rub you can apply it generously to your joints or muscle and massage it in well if you're using our calm CBD roll-on you apply it to your neck and chest as desired pretty simple right of course it's not just important to know how to use CBD knowing how to make it part of your daily routine is just as crucial you see a lot of people use CBD once or twice and when they don't experience instant results decide that it just doesn't work for them but before you decide CBD doesn't work for you be sure to give it a chance we recommend using it daily for 30 days that will give you the opportunity to really see how CBD can work for you the idea is to make it a consistent habit if you're using calm CBD roll-on make it part of your bedtime routine if you exercise regularly make CBD muscle rub part of your post-workout routine it's combination of pure essential oils and CBD offers a cooling sensation and can help soothe sore muscles use CBD oils it may help to use it around the same time every day to establish a routine you can always use that at different times as desired but it's a good idea to try to use it regularly so it becomes a habit as you create a routine around CBD it's important to remember that everyone is different we all have our own unique circumstances and things affect us in different ways your experience with CBD may not be identical to other people who have used it don't get caught up thinking that your own experience is a failure just because it's different than somebody else's try writing down why you chose to start using CBD then jot down a few notes about how you feel every day so you can track your well-being over time and at the end of 30 days you'll be able to look back and reflect you may also experience more result by using a higher strength product nature's ultra each of the products is available in two concentrations of CBD some people achieve the results start looking for at a lower strength and others will achieve them at a higher strength we recommend starting at a lower concentration and working your way up to a higher concentration if desired over time you'll find the perfect routine and strength for

welcome to my channel I love CBD this channel is gonna be dedicated for reviewing different kinds of CBD products from different brands if you're not familiar with CBD CBD is extracted from marijuana weed it gives you all the benefits that you get from smoking marijuana or ingesting marijuana without the high so what are the benefits benefits from CBD are relieving stress relieving some pains like joint pains back pains anxiety it also promotes natural sleep and it would actually help you get some very vivid dreams because it puts you in a very deep sleep mode so if you have problems dreaming and use CBD you're more likely to get a dream or two however today we're gonna be reviewing this brand which is called hemp bomb hand bomb is a pretty popular brand nowadays and it's available in different smoke shops it's available on websites online this one right here is oil form and CBD comes in different forms there is capsules there are strings there's oils there's this oil form is used for either dripping or vaping there's also edibles there's quite a few different forms of CBD that you could take and we're gonna go through a bunch of them as we make more videos for reviews so this one right here is the oil form it is 300 mg which is 300 milligrams which is a pretty decent strength the contents of this oil is not pure or not just CBD but it's also mixed with hemp oil grapeseed oil and MCT oil when I first got this one I thought it would be a little stronger just because it's 300 milligrams and when I tried it dripping wise I thought that it wasn't as strong as I thought it would be just because I tried other brands that had lower mg and I felt that the strength was comparable or close so it wasn't as strong as I thought it was gonna be as far as the flavor usually I prefer no flavor and unflavored CBD just a straight flavor of CBD which is kind of earthy sometimes but this brand makes their oils in two flavors which is minty and grape and this one right here is minty so even though I usually prefer unflavored I did not mind this one because the mint enos of it is not too strong it's a little subtle but it's quite refreshing when you drip it and I didn't mind the flavor at all but strength-wise it was okay I think I would probably go with a stronger one next time and they do make stronger ones they make 600 mg and 1000 mg and you could get a stronger one or you could just strip a little bit more so as far as the dripping I would give it four out of five stars just because I thought it would be stronger but it wasn't but I was actually pretty impressed when I used it in my vape and when I baked it it had the taste of CBD to it plus the mint enos which wasn't too strong again it makes pretty well with my bait juice it didn't completely change the flavor and give it a little bit of maintenance and the CBD flavor and the strength was pretty decent so I would give it five out of five stars for vaping and that's it for this one for hemp balm and I would actually try it again it's not it's not a not a bad brand it's pretty popular and they do a lot of promotions and they have quite a variety of CBD so I'll give it another shot I'll try something different next time and I'll let you go I'll let you guys know what happens as far as pricing pricing is pretty much average I found it priced at $39.99 all the way up to 49.99 I think on their website they set for $49.99 but you could find it cheaper and other places so hand bomb this is the brand three milligrams I recommend it as it works does the job if you liked this video please give me a like at the bottom if you'd like to get more reviews about CBD and stay updated with us just hit the subscribe button and we'll be making a lot more videos about more brands alright I hope you

per ml for a hundred and fifty pound person the daily dose of CBD is basically twenty milligrams or one full dropper inside this bottle is a glass dropper with a line indicating the ml or CC mark so it says milliliter that milliliter mark indicates that's the 20 milligram dosage and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "T0dObVCg0wQ": "trying to figure out how much CBD oil to take can be frustrating most resources tell you to start out low and gradually work up but if you're not noticing any results it can be tempting to double or even triple a dose in a single day doing this can be counterproductive so make sure you establish a clear dosage plan if you anticipate taking CBD over the long-term it's important to remember that CBD is not a miracle cure don't expect to take a few drops of tincture and voila all your symptoms are gone the effects of CBD oil are not instant and many people make the mistake of using CBD once or twice and then writing it off completely if it doesn't work in terms of where to start with dosing we recommend just starting out with a low potency oil a dose or single serving is pretty universal at one milliliter of oil which is exactly 20 drops so rather than trying a single drop or two of a high potency formula start out with a low potency 200 to 300 milligram bottle take a single one milliliter serving and see how you feel in order to know exactly how many milligrams of CBD you're taking you need to know two things the total CBD content of the bottle and the size of the bottle in milligrams for example let's use a standard 30 milliliter bottle that contains 300 milligrams of CBD total if you take a 1 milliliter dose this would equate to 10 milligrams of CBD the key in deciphering dosage is to stick with how much you're taking for at least a week in other words don't immediately up your dosage if you don't notice any effects at first and give the CBD time to work with the receptors in your body if you still don't notice any effects after about a week then you can start upping the dose however be mindful of the fact that your CBD oils ineffectiveness could just be that you're using a low quality product the manufacturing of CBD oil is still largely unregulated so the amount listed on your bottles labeled could in fact be far from the amount that's actually contained inside also when administering servings remember to put the drops under your tongue and hold for at least 30 seconds before swallowing this will give the CBD ample time to be absorbed into the bloodstream before entering the digestive tract and lastly increased dosages gradually and be patient it could take time for your body to respond to the act of CBD compound so don't get frustrated if a week 2 weeks or even more goes by without noticing much effect also if you have access to a doctor or healthcare professional who's willing to talk to you about CBD be sure to speak with them do you have any input or first-hand experience dosing CBD be sure to share your thoughts with the community by leaving a comment below [Music]", "wRuY6JSRoME": "oh yeah I got caught smoking weed at universities I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "ReAwGOsgZIU": "the beats of New York 103 five KTU we've got a crowded studio yeah this ladies and gentlemen we got the one and only doctor lubricant got it all here oh you know what Greg T we're we're getting out of that people are asking if you're gonna give him his annual prostate exam while you're here dr. Cox and I think that we're gonna we're gonna do something different at KT we have always wanted to do something so much fun now with dr. oz but then everybody's like no way we shouldn't but now over here kids respectful yeah I wanted to have a lot of fun I wanted to do something want it coming naked or something no that's okay doing that fine I don't need to see that dr. oz it's so great to see you you were wonderful in the show as always thank you so much show oh yeah you're the best so we have so much to talk to you about first of all I want to understand why you did not bring our flu shots well I found out so late I couldn't get it I'll give it to a lot of my staff I give it the folks on the show yeah and I I like you in the flu shot because I think people under appreciate vaccines the crazy thing about this whole argument we're having is people think they're treated like chattel they think they're forced to get a vaccine it's not about that yeah you don't wanna get a vaccine I'm fine with that I personally think it's unwise I don't want to lie on my back for a week I put the flu no I've had the flu and been hospitalized for it and why do think they've had the flu what they had was you know a minor version of something but it wasn't really the flu could you get the flu you really really said no absolutely a physician I don't get much of a choice I really can't afford to spread it from patient the patient's so like just the vaccine we all of us have to and then in the hospital but you guys in the in in in this studio you're safe but you're out doing public events so often yeah shaking a lot of people's hands like I do maybe Caroline you've been down my shirt I'm I said if I say it shake the heads of two hundred people a day yeah and I and one of them has the flu which is gonna be the case I'm gonna spread it to 200 people yeah so I try to be the firewall and all about half the population gets vaccinated if more got vaccinated it'll be harder for the virus to spread amongst us are we late dr. oz cuz I've heard some people saying you're late I haven't gotten mine yet to be honest no you're not late in fact you're never late okay even in january/february get the vaccine it still makes sense however if you're gonna get it it's the same vaccine now as you'll get a month now just get it now and be done with it okay wonderful well now you are going to be at our seventh annual iHeartRadio lifestyle health and well in this Expo Greg tee and I have both had the privilege of being there with you it is such an informative event for people who haven't been tell them like what what it's all about okay so remember ninth that's all afternoon I get to speak for a while about stuff that matters today so I'll talk about CBD this year and this week on it but I'm gonna talk about that CBD and who should get it who shouldn't and how do you know if it's legit stuff yeah and then I'll talk a little bit about some of the the food fads the hottest thing is coming like for example there's a for me flower powers big issue what is flower power there's all these new flowers out there someone from teff which is an African seed some of them are from banana flowers there's there's there's a lot of vegetable flowers and these are actually able to replace traditional old-fashioned wheat flour coconut flour yes but the thing is they're not easy to use a lot of these flours so if you as the companies get better at understanding what we really need is hampi prefers eat healthily you can replace bad flowers with good flour so less simple carbohydrates more nutrients in them and it tastes great it's got a more of an exotic feel to it let it guess I mean as an example so we're talking about you know different ways you can cook it takes you to the good life god life you want to live what are the steps well how do you differently how to exercise different how do you think they're for me because the big epidemic in America today's loneliness yes and when you come to the health I heart health expo you will not be lonely now of course the music's fantastic lots of free stuff the exercise classes it's it why would you not do it that's what the big question I was gonna say free stuff always gets people in the door wedding you should be at the Sheraton on the 9th of November in the afternoon with me it's gonna be awesome and I've gone like I said and you you've been there as well it is such an event disagree so much you walk away with so much more yes surprisingly so shocked I learned nobody wants to go to like doctors so you know people avoid the doctor they don't want to go but they do go and then honestly when you get there it's not just like you're sitting there just like talking to us there's so many guest speakers that are up there so there's a lot more that's going on so you actually walk out there going huh you know what that really wasn't all that bad it was pretty informative it wasn't all that bad what an endorsement talk seriously 11 William Beaumont New York is gonna save you Greg T he has a question for dr. oz good morning William I'm good morning good morning how are you we're doing great so you have a question for dr. oz yes dr. oz so I'm a little bit of an overweight guy I'm 385 pounds but I have this stubborn belly fat that just won't go flat but what could I do to uh to get rid of the belly belly I like that question because I've got dad fat right now dr. oz how do how do you get rid of that is that the cortisol is that that what's happening there in the middle so dr. boot has knows part of the answer so here's the issue belly fat happens for two reasons one is we are stressed and when we're stressed release a hormone that forces us to eat a lot of food now why would the body do that because a thousand years ago stress was about a famine not having enough food that's good that was the major reason you were stressed out your family's gonna starve to death so you release hormones that make you hungry for things you don't even like and force you to eat too much of it so people would belly fat I can almost always guarantee art managing their stress that well that's part one part two is the food that we eat can cause a stress like simple carbohydrates stress out them in the metabolic system of the body they stimulate insulin to go up which is the hormone that's deposits to fat in your belly so if you eat complex carbs or proteins that's why the Kido died paleo are so popular because you're not eating simple carbs yeah then you won't have that hormonal disarray that that craziness that messes up your metabolism and that's why I'm talking about flower power and you can these are topics that I'm getting getting into in the show this week I really think it's important for people to stock their pantries with foods that naturally reduce the inflammation and irritation in their body Whole Foods whole foods to come out the ground look and they look when you eat them right heating greens a good example me it's actually stressed you a little bit so those kinds of dietary habits will reduce your belly fat and the reason I care about belly fat is not just because you have that svelt body that's used up when you're a kid it's because belly fat specifically leads to high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar the main reasons we died so it was a weird like I legitimately like I've gotten some some little tummy tucks here and there but the thing is no matter what I do no matter how hard I go to the gym like I was there on Saturday I'm doing like you know tummy tucks like you've actually had procedures like I wanted to kind of gloss over that but I had to come out I still cannot seem to get rid of this dad belly that I call it and I cannot stand it I just don't know what else did you like is there something at the gym that I can do but you're telling me that I'm stressing and I'm getting it from eating carbs and that's where it's it's coming when you're stressed and aren't sleeping yeah your brain will naturally crave food especially carbs he does not sleep dr. oz he wakes up at two o'clock in the morning and he comes here unnecessary get show prep done that's right by taya this is the same argument people want to work out in the morning if you have a choice between sleep and working out sleep if you have a choice between sleep and going to work you sleepy choice between sleep and eating you sleep if you have a choice means sleep and sex have sex yes my wife Trish just got diagnosed and now she has she has a she's on this gluten-free diet here's the thing that we about gluten-free and everything years ago nobody heard of this and all of a sudden now it's happening in so many of our friends and relatives and neighbors everybody's going oh I can't have it's gluten they can't have it how does that just happen overnight Trish is in her 40s and she never had problems all of a sudden she was gonna get a physical so T that you mention it doesn't make any sense to me so I'll give you a couple answers because they're a couple reasons why it's happening the forces there are actually some infections like alpha gal is a autoimmune response to a tick bite that we think is linked to some of these intestinal problems people are having second thing is folks folks have so much inflammation in their body from the foods are naturally eating including I think some of the toxins in the environment that the body wages of Civil War and it's gut and when it's raising and waging raging a civil war and small irritants like gluten get in there it's a problem they're gluten has changed the wheat has actually changed a little bit since what we originally were harvesting 12,000 years ago the way it's manufactured food is not actually made it's been in our bodies just cannot adjust is one of several reasons but but the most important is I think a lot of people think they have wooden intolerance mm-hmm and they actually have something bigger than gluten intolerance they're having an issue with the basic foods are putting in their body and now here's the problem when you eat gluten-free right take a white piece of white bread yeah right it takes a gluten out of it what gluten is there for reason it's a protein that binds they eat together stick that out you're gonna put something else in there that's synthetic and fake they make up for it right which the body doesn't recognize right and so now you got a separate problem going on so I think that but if you happen to have a gluten problem which is you know pretty common short avoid foods that naturally have gluten you can't eat white bread right no no she can't see there's so many things you cannot have well no we have to get into it after this right I think it's been confirmed I have a great T in tolerance for that now Christine is calling we'll take more of your calls at 802 4 5 103 5 and more of your texts at 6 9 9 3 5 with dr. oz next on Katie you know I wish we had like cameras and microphones we have cameras are so much going on in the background while we go to commercials and songs like we're sitting here talking and I had no idea dr. oz you come from a family filled with women it's just you we're talking about how we have to be bros to each other way overwhelmed yes he wants a bro he wants dr. oz to be his brother by women dr. oz I have my wife and two daughters then I come here and it's a room full of full of women I have no bros so you could be my bro we could like do a bro handshake and everything oh my goodness we team up to understand what we're doing we're doing bro talk wait I do want to ask dr. oz what do you do get into Halloween at all like oh yeah for Halloween Carrie can you reveal it to us yes so I I was unwrapping so the kids have been ordering they sit with my wife and they just planned this out and we had the grandkids with us right now so I little John it was just turned for this we say yeah he's got a little a box suit so I asked him what's the what is this about he goes what does the Fox say that's the song walk around yeah I'm thinking of going like Mad Max cuz I'm you know I can't actually trick-or-treat with the kids they won't let me dr. oz sure can't go trick-or-treating with them oh I do but I sort of hide the shadows behind them they don't want me actually walking up with them because they want to be big kids yeah they want to go by themselves without me you know lumbering over them do you want to ask what kind of a candy giver is dr. oz treating you always knew like who was giving out the good stuff you know it was always like a really nice big home like like a mansion kind of thing yeah I don't know where you live but I'm imagining that you don't have a small house so what does a celebrity like yourself what do you give away for Halloween you see apple slices a raisin apple slices subscribe Greg tea I have a nice house in New Jersey yeah and I love the neighborhood and in it's a you know it's like a fertility clinic our neighborhood everyone has kids and so we decorate the house up crazily yeah we have all kinds of it's basically a theme park that house long drive way to get to the house so the hallway there scary little things and so the kids have to walk up there and their parents it's a whole Gitmo maybe they start they come in packs so instead of getting single big treats we give lots of small ones but they take a shovel really yeah shovel them out in literally with a plastic shovel into their bags they almost always run out and I buy I'm talking about garbage tins and usually I don't even been there by 10:00 10:30 we pretend we're asleep candy right Christine still on the line I don't know if she hung up no we do yes Christine you have been so patient and holding dr. Oz's here what was your question for him good morning I'm so excited to be on the radio good morning I'm 44 years old I've struggled with my weight my entire life and I was diagnosed at hypothyroid and I'm finally in the normal range with my numbers but I'm really still struggling with weight loss I've been doing low-carb for about like literally of two months and I've only dropped about five pounds I was wondering if there was a certain type of diet to follow for hyperthyroid or if there's something I should stay away from or so let me walk you through a couple thoughts first I'm glad you got that your - thyroid diagnosed because it's very difficult to lose weight if your thyroid is not working it's the metabolic stimulant to the body and there are diets that help the thyroid but you should probably be on thyroid support if if you're not already I assume you are yes okay so let's focus on what might work there's no five pounds of weight loss is a lot of weight loss people think I'll lose ten pounds in a week I can tell you the only way to do that is get an amputation oh jeez it's not happening you might lose water weight in a week like that but you're not gonna lose true fat weight that quickly five pounds is about the most you can lose a fat weight in two months so you're actually on a good program so don't lose contact here's what to Kay for you to focus on there's no way for you to stay on a diet the rest of your life you need to eat food that you love that happens to be good for you so you should focus on taking that low carb diet and modifying it so you actually enjoy being on it but if you could stay on it I don't know how much of what you are but if you can stay on that diet for a year on average most people lose 15 to 20 pounds which is really all you have to lose for most of America you lose those 15 20 pounds you're back in your playing weight your hormones get better your air your drives for almost everything you want to do in life gets improved and that's actually what you're looking for anyway well the thing is not having a hard time following it this is actually very easy for me to follow and I'm not really hungry but the numbers are not reflected in the scale which is really which you know it's kind of you know the faster you lose weight the faster you rebound back up again in yo-yo you want to lose weight slowly the weight plan you're on I can tell you just from what you're saying is if you truly lost five pounds you're on the right program because that's a lot of weight loss you're not finding it difficult to stay on it I've had countless guests on my show they always tell me the same story I tried diet diet a diet I finally found one that was easy and then all of a sudden got I lost all the weight and you're gonna lose it slowly but surely but you won't gain it back which is all you care about Christine we appreciate you know what I found dr. oz that as I get older I used to be able to drop like three pounds like that and now as I'm getting into my 40s it is more and more difficult that metabolism is working against it out she's 44 years old yeah and you know you're when you start losing estrogen people worry about menopause you also lose testosterone okay and testosterone is the one is the hormone that keeps the muscle mass where it is and without muscle mass you're not a metabolic furnace anymore you can't burn through calories so anything you eat any transgression you make an extra couple sips of beer a little cake here with your friends that all begins to add up because you don't have the muscle mass to burn it off to control me what happened so what not me I have enough testosterone I got here on my chest dr. oz I should check it to special' know but I think that you're describing my doctor I do want to get into some of your shows if you guys are not watching dr. oz you are missing out on so many things not only are you still teaching us how to obviously lose weight how to be better with our health but also you're doing these investigative reports that are just so incredible I want to talk to you though about a big burning question can you give us any more information about CBD I feel like it's so much out there there's a lot of questions people are wondering whether or not it's safe for them even for younger kids people just don't understand what exactly CBD really is and what it can do for them well CBDs today's topic actually okay rose okay which is just to get past that real quickly you know I people aren't sure it's good or bad we're gonna lay it out and tell you what to tell you what's going on including these two new giant avocado which is five pounds Wow I mean it's like a salsa for the neighborhood issue because and it's number one question can you ask these years we decide to dedicate some time today to the biggest questions like does it help you sleep there's like with the aches and pains about my mood and it turns out that CBD probably works for all three of those things but but this is a big button when we actually go back and test the products themselves most are fake really have nothing in them literally or they are they're so little right of the real true ingredient that it can't possibly work and I sell the good companies to you because I hear so many all of hunting advertised I don't know which one it is that that's the best one to use I'm gonna walk you through the ones that I that I think make sense I get I have no relationships with CBD companies so I try to stay immune from being influenced but I'm gonna share with everybody the ones that I like but I gotta say couple things first the reason it's so much fraud fraud is it's really expensive to make CBD it's actually much more expensive to make CBD than pot really and this future I think will be a little bit of marijuana pot with CBD potentiates it you won't need quite as much CBD so it'd be more affordable for the average person but I can tell you're up to bat if you're not if it's not costing you 30 40 50 bucks probably not real CBD just the pricing is like that and out the other thing is you go to the websites of the companies you're interested in look to see if they've been certified if they actually have any kind of certificate of what's in them most these companies are just marketing companies and here's the problem the marketing companies have no cost of goods right they're not buying any stuff because they're not putting real CBD in there so they can take all their money use it for advertising oh my god so the more they advertise right the more I get worried about it that's right nice packaging but you know all this stuff going on and yet they're not spending money on the real product right so they actually can make it for cheaper and then they drive out the good guys and the whole my goodness yeah I you know what I actually spent money on a CBD cream and I thought oh this is gonna be amazing it's awesome I have looked at the that's the big issue now if your husband hadn't said that you'd think this doesn't work yeah and in reality maybe it would have work we don't know for sure they've damn in good clinical trial insanity but what if it would have worked and you'll try it anymore because you've got a bad product once but if you can't sleep and see but he could have helped you right but because you don't think it worked cause you bought sawdust last time and then found that to be ineffective you sure throw away the whole field and that's the biggest risk that they had was vaping and I think it's it's parallel the vapors did not get together and clean up the business so half the vape of the 10 billion dollar business is fake a lot of the fake stuff I think was poisoning people right well died and 91 says VAP is bad for you whereas if the vaping guys who had good products had gotten together and said we're gonna make clean products we're gonna police ourselves regulate yeah yeah me come in here regulate because we can't do it by ourselves we would have avoided multiple deaths and maybe saved in industry this you're touching so many have so many issues here like even like the word organic like everybody's putting the word organic on everybody's food so people go shopping and they see the word organic and they think oh it's gonna be healthy but that's not a reality either there's so many like fake organic foods that are even out there just using the word or twelve ingredients why ingrediences organic it it's already they get the stamp of approval nobody policing any of these things well the US government always believed that manufacturers because there were big manufacturers would do a good job and I'd be honorable to what they're writing on their package it's illegal to not to lie on your packaging but people have gotten very clever of gaming the system I think again the big boys have to come together in every industry yeah and say we're gonna be tougher on our industry right and actually invite in regulations so they get a little support but it's most evident in high profits basis right vaping is very profitable that must make it and and you know cigarettes don't cost much to make cigarettes it's all the perceived value CB the same thing and that we're talking about these ideas because they're the ones that end up catching up to us the thing about avocados go back for one second yeah when it comes to the Nature Made package right right a real piece of fruit they can't cheat you right right if it says organic avocado it has to be organic so you buy a packaged product to save time and money and then they put a little bit of avocado in there but twelve other ingredients that you don't know what they're i ricardo chips yeah yeah yeah it's like basically potato chip with green coloring no dr. oz my takeaway men it is illegal to lie about your packaging and I love you thank you so much don't forget 270 no I hurt radial lifestyle Health and Wellness Expo it's on November 9th we'll have more information for you at ketv.com you can always check out our favorite doctor odds blow your cool down also dr. oz anything else you want

reviews in the marketplace due to its ability to induce relaxation instead of the high filling however there is limited information about the appropriate dosage for once use and it has been challenging to settle on definite quantity of CBD CBD that a person can take since the substance that interacts with the anti endocannabinoid system receptors meaning that it plays a role in the secretion of the hormones that are related to our response to stress so this system it changes one's psychology changes so physiological changes sorry so the dosage it's gonna vary depending on the CBD concentration the weight of the user and just his or her own body chemistry so I did do a little digging and this is what I found the current measure that's recommended by many of the CBD experts is that we take one to six milligrams of CBD for every ten pounds so this measure it actually applies at a 220 pound individual can comfortably take twenty to thirty milligrams of CBD while a 165 pound person can completely do can-can comfortably do with ten to twenty milligrams these measurements are just what works for a majority of individuals it's not does it mean that that's the scale so you never know until you try and I remember the first time my friend introduced me to try CBD started at 50 milligrams a day and I had no problem with it I felt a little drowsy I had a little bit of dry mouth at the same quantity so you need to just experiment until you find what's comfortable for your body and the other requirement is that you take they say take CBD twice a day for better results so a 220-pound err will take 10 to 15 milligrams in the morning in the same quantity at bedtime so you should this quantity when you're first starting out on seat with CBD just to kind of have a consistency for the best results however after a month or two of usage you can actually double its insure and no strong with me endo cannabinoid receptors will have adapted to the effects of CBD and this was just some research that I that I found you can find it to the experts in the field actually recommend that daily dose should should not exceed two hundred milligrams but you know you might be having questions about whether there there's a difference between the percentage of the CBD and its measure in milligram and these dosage recommendations are actually measured in milligrams since many CBD oils they are naturally extracted so that means they're a hundred percent pure so to start with twenty milligrams CBD per day and see how that works for you also you know consult with your doctor if you feel better about it and see what he or she would recommend for you and and also I really think that it depends on why you're using CBD and this is just my opinion I think that if you're using it maybe for some sort of physical pain then I think that you would need to take maybe more but if you're you but if you're using it for some sort of anxiety take less I don't know I usually I take mine specifically for anxiety and my boyfriend takes it for sleep and to have an extra pep in his day and also I know a few people that have taken it for headaches for for elements for for pain of physical physical pain so like I said I'll do some other videos on different reasons that CBD oil is taken for what reasons like I did another video on the my anxiety that I have and the reason that I take CBD for it and then when I'm sleep and then I'm going to cover another one on migraines headaches because it works amazing for that and yeah so share comment like if you take CBD oil let me know in the comments below how much you take what you take it for how much you weigh what you would recommend and or if you have a doctor that recommended how much you should take then just let me know in the comments below and I will see you guys on the next video bye", "6eBAMdTeuIY": "let's talk about CBD but this time I got the high doses you gotta check these out I got the 300 and I got the 500s let's go what's up guys that your boy big J coming back at you again from Vaiko TV where you watched aside and vape and like I said earlier I've got the big boy doses now I've got CBD FX but I've got it in 300 milligrams and they're brand new 500 milligrams all right this this right here rashia is for those of you that may be a little further along as far as you know you got some other issues that the 60 milligram and the 120 milligram and the gummy bears and the pills don't work for all right boom we got you covered all right we didn't forget about you we didn't forget about we got you covered with these all right so without further ado let's go ahead check out the box then we'll check out the bottle then we'll go over why it's all legal and good and all that stuff and then we're gonna taste test it and then we'll go from there we'll see what happens see what happens all right maybe I give me a little testimonial um Oh so it's chair of the box so here it is hashtag feel the difference CBD FX 300 milligram 10 mil bottle made in the USA produced in FDA registered facility two pharmaceutical standards very important that you buy stuff that is made in a pharmaceutical lab okay or an FDA approved pharmaceutical lab this is going into your body alright the better it is you might as well put the best stuff you possibly can in all right registered facility to pharmaceutical standards pretty and it's approved by the FDA I'm in alright we all know what kind of pricks the FDA can be so boom I'm in let's roll it around and again it's so important that they put it on here a couple times producing an FDA register facility to pharmaceutical standards okay I listen if that's what I did I'd be I'd be loud and proud about it to see dfx hashtag feel the difference trademark boom ingredients proprietary blend of CBD propylene glycol vegetable glycerin it's just like your vape juice except instead of flavoring it's got CBD so it's basically the same stuff these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited now that little phrase right there again we're gonna go over that because that's what I got the fact sheet for CBD and CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant that is legally imported and produced again very important if you've heard oh I heard CBD is illegal I'm about to smash that for you with the little fact sheet but we'll get to that CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products they're in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the UC or the US CSA got that covered too in the fact sheet and then there's some trademark stuff here made in Los Angeles flip it over shake before each use for best results you do want to do that any time you get CBD in a liquid form you want to shake it because some separation will occur during shipping or just leaving it sit some residue is natural which is true if you use a tank you will get some residue in the tank again not a big deal suggested use for a tank one to two droppers pool for a dripper one and a half to one droppers pool for a tank rich in the central omega-3 fatty acids and amino acids hashtag feel the difference and boom we're back around to the front now that being said here is the 500 alright you'll see it's a little bit different but as far as the box goes other than the colors this is 500 milligrams per 10 mil versus 300 milligrams for 10 mil but other than that you know it's just kind of flip-flop and both it's basically the same so I won't go through the same you know go through the box again with you I just wanted to show it to you so we'll set it off to the side and pop a bottle out alright so here is your bottle CBD FX 300 milligram 10 ml bottle as you can see this liquid is a little bit darker if you want to go back and check the 60 and 120 milligrams bottles you'll see this has a little more obviously a higher concentrate of CBD in it so it is going to be a little bit darker roll it around ingredients obviously there's CBD propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin and it is manufactured in Los Angeles California roll it around shake before you choose for best results we already covered that and again don't forget some residue is natural and it is made in the USA and we're back around to the front now let's go ahead and try so here's the bottle basically what you're gonna do is gonna come child say if you wrap in plastic just go around the top here until you find the perforation which it is double perforated so I gotta do click it boom strip comes off and then everything comes out grab ahold of it shake it like they say alright the reason you want to do that again is to get everything mixed back up like it's supposed to be bone alright so your as you can see instead of being kind of see-through now it's kind of like cloudy milky a little bit push down on the bottle and spin and there you go all right kind of almost reminds me of like orange juice in that consistency so let's try I just put a little bit under my tongue you know that's CBD if you've never experienced CBD before it does have a bit of an earthy flavor too it's the best way I can describe it I don't really know how else to describe it unless you've actually tried it if you have a better word for it dropping in the comments below I don't know how else to describe if flavor is a big thing for you check out the website check out my other videos they do have gummy bears which tastes just like cherry or like a cherry fruit punch to me and they've got sugar in it which is nice to check out the chill shots lemonade awesome and then they also have some hemp capsules which have absolutely no taste to them at all so if taste is gonna be one of those things where you're like oh god I don't like the taste that's fine there's other products CBD FX makes other products that you can try with still you know still has CBD in it so you're good you're good we got your family we got you now as promised thanks chief alright so you may have heard that CBD is illegal well it's not and here's why non-psychoactive hemp was deemed illegal by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 ok there's number one there hemp biomass which is basically the hemp crop that they derive the CBD from comes with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security so if Homeland Security said it's cool cool they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants very important and we'll get to that in a minute product meet this the CBD FX products that contains CBD meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to have less than 0.3 percent THC in it okay now because all of the stuff I've already mentioned their products are exempt from the CSA and DEA drug scheduling practices which classify whole hep extracts as schedule one drugs why because extracts from the stocks of EU European okay European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so boom legal nothing to worry about alright plans simple they figured out how CBD FX figured out how to get you a legal CBD awesome right that's what I'm saying now you're probably a nice thing does it work it's probably why you're even watching the video does it work doesn't work does work I can't say whether it were it will work for you I'm not allowed to because the FDA says I'm not allowed to alright but what I can tell you is my own personal experiences but I use CBD for the following reasons when I go to bed my head doesn't shut off alright I am up for hours afterwards thinking about this that the other thing flipping through a social media looking at my phone etc if you are one of those people there's a strong chance that might work for you because it helps me that way I am NOT a YouTube millionaire so therefore I do have to have a day job at my day job I work in a factory I do a lot of walking across concrete floors I do a lot of climbing the ladders and all that other fun stuff so therefore when I come home my feet hurt my knees hurt my ankles hurt my back hurts everything hurts alright you reach a certain age when you go out into the real world get a job and everything's not provided for you and then you realize what those jobs come aches and pains boom enter CBD alright takes the edge off the aches and pains for me it's right up there with an ibuprofen and I don't even like taking that because that'll screw with your liver it works for me I don't go to the doctor I hate the doctor I don't like Big Pharma's pills and agendas being shoved down my throat and all that other crap so I prefer natural type stuff all right smell as natural as you get you may see on some other videos out in YouTube land or on the internet of people saying well it didn't work for me okay it might not have okay it doesn't work for everybody okay there is nothing that's 100% in this world other than death and taxes but keep in mind those may also be the people that well I'm gonna try some took some oh well it didn't work immediately or it didn't work exactly the way I thought it was going to so therefore it doesn't work and I'm gonna tell everybody it doesn't work well that's not necessarily true okay if you go to the doctor they give you a prescription tell you to take one pill you take one pill it doesn't work do you automatically stop taking it or do you call the doctor and say hey the one pill is not working if you do say that what's he gonna say well then take two all right take it you know they're or they'll figure it out until you get to a point where whatever they prescribe you works okay the right dosage same thing with this play with it okay you got to figure out what dosage works for you the suggested one dropper might not work for you you might need to one dropper and you might be like wow I feel amazing let me try a half dropper and a half dropper full might work for you okay play with it all right it's all about you okay it's all about what works for you give it a chance if you don't give it a chance then you'll probably one of the haters that's putting comments you know on the internet so if you want some and I don't suggest you try something like I said this is the more high-powered stuff if you've got bigger issues going on and again unfortunately I can't necessarily say what it will work for with the FDA but do your own research okay look at other people's testimonials about it okay and if you have some of the symptoms that they have and the 60 and 120 didn't really work for you try the 300 of the 500 all right yeah boom there's the 500 so just remember look for either the gold box or the purple box all right try it just get do yourself a favor and try it alright that's all I ask for you if you're worried about you know I said it helps me shut my mind off notice I didn't say it makes me drowsy I can take this in the morning and be 100% fine the rest of the day alright just puts me on a nice even keel and I'm good to go so don't worry about any of that so if you want to try something here's what I suggest you do check the description below you're gonna find a link to both products directly on the website click the button a couple times puts in your basket pays for it Bo and puts it on your doorstep so until next time it's your boy big J for venko TV where you watch the side and vape an eye out [Music]", "8AjfOxhmjcM": "how much CBD should I take when starting out with CBD many people want to know what's the best amount of CBD to take it depends on what you want to achieve each person is unique and will experience different effects CBD takes time to build in the body much like some vitamins you can take a small amount every day well you might not notice an immediate effect over time you should begin to detect more balanced calm and peace of mind in your life some people may notice a more extreme difference than others imagine someone who is deficient in vitamin C taking a vitamin C supplement will create a radical change in their health CBD is similar to a vitamin and that it helps to maintain and support overall health if your endocannabinoid system is depleted or imbalanced taking CBD could produce tremendous changes more quickly than someone who has a healthy endocannabinoid tone if you're already healthy CBD may not be noticeable right away what your friends may take a high amount of CBD and notice immediate changes you may not need the same amount the following is a general guideline a good way to start is with the mild range take the amount recommended for your weight not feeling anything within the mild range if mild doesn't work for you it could be good to reach for a higher dosage and try out the medium range go for the high dosage if you haven't noticed any changes in the medium range some people take more than 100 milligrams of CBD each day it all depends on your health and your body experiment to find out what works best for you how often should I take CBD there are three main schedules that people use to take CBD once or twice per day every two to three hours so that they feel the effects throughout the day and hourly micro dosing for CBD oil we recommend starting with one quarter drop daily during the first week moving up to one half a dropper during the second week three quarters of a dropper during the third week and a full dropper on the fourth week for CBD balm it's suggested to apply a healthy amount to the area where you are experiencing pain dryness or stiffness every six hours for vaping CBD you should start with three normal inhales and wait 30 minutes to fully feel the effects until inhaling more for edibles and soft gels start with one shoe or one capsule every 12 hours so what is the right amount of CBD to take there's a few key points to remember when you're determining the right amount of CBD to take remember to start slow and work your way up there is no right amount of CVD to take each person is different you can use our chart as a starting guide until you figure out what works best for you enjoy the process and the wonderful calm and peace that CBD can bring into your life [Music]", "CPFckEZ2of0": "hi I'm dr. Rachel Knox and this is my sister dr. Jessica Knox and we're two of four physicians in our family who make up the Knox docks and we are a team of physicians who specialize in cannabinoid medicine which is with a specialization in the endocannabinoid system so we do consider ourselves endocannabinoids i know that is a mouthful but we are here because we believe in the power of the endocannabinoid system to harness health and wellness and we focus on helping people achieve that using Kanab MO medic products like CBD so a lot of people wonder how can I best get the benefit from CBD when should I take it how should I take it how much should I take yeah a lot of it lots of questions about how to maximize benefit from it and part of that depends on what are you using it for so we actually really like CBD as part of your wellness routine and if that's why you're using CBD then really you can take it at any time of the day and whether that's morning noon night as long as it's something that's working into your routine so that it becomes part of that routine so you can benefit from it on a daily basis yeah and you know a good general serving size for wellness is around 20 to 50 milligrams of CBD the whole idea is to start at low doses and increase slowly over time I think another important thing to know is that CBD is lipophilic meeting it likes fats so it actually dissolves better and sort of more Libby's dinner yeah in a fat based product like in oil as opposed to an alcohol alcohol based product where it was sort of like clump it will clump and then you have to like really shake your your products really well to make sure you're getting CBD but if it's in an oil-based product it'll be distributed nicely in there and you can just sort of take that and feel confident that you're getting CBD in the serving size that you're using yeah so certainly there aren't any restrictions to taking CBD on an empty stomach or on a full stomach you can take it when it makes sense for you but keep in mind that that CBD like dr. Jessica said it's lipophilic it likes fat so if you consume it with fat you'll probably increase the bioavailability meaning the absorption into your body another really important thing to know about CBD is there is sort of like a maximum like point of benefit where we call it a biphasic effect where there's this curve and as you start at sort of like a low dose or low yeah serving and you add on you can get more benefit incremental benefit as you increase that serving size our dosage but there's a point at which beyond this little sweet spot if you keep adding more you're starting to lose the benefit you're going down this other side of the curve where it's just sort of like why why shoot pass this sweet spot because now you're sort of wasting resources and and your body's not getting any additional benefit from going over that serving size for some people we actually see that once they get past this sort of sweet spot there they're sort of losing some of the benefit and what that tells us is hey you need to back off on that serving size a little bit and go back to that sweet spot yeah and we we see that a lot less on our full spectrum fully extracted products and we see that effect a lot more on more isolate CBD products something else that we often don't talk about and you know users and patients don't quite ask enough is are there any drug drug interactions so for consumers or patients who are on a lot of pharmaceuticals we call that public pharmaceutical you do have to consider any CBD drug interactions so CBD is metabolized by the liver along with 25% of our pharmaceutical drugs that's hundreds of drugs and so for folks who might be might be consuming laundry lists of prescription drugs I actually really advise you to talk with a health care professional about using CBD and how much you use because CBD as an inhibitor of certain enzymes in the system that metabolized all of these drugs can cause an increase of the pharmaceutical drugs that we take so I can't stress it enough if you're on a lot of prescription drugs please please please talk to a health care provider about your CV to use yeah because you might need to adjust the dosage of some of those other medications very important yeah and I'm glad you said that because in our in our clinic we see patients on tons of pharmaceutical drugs and it's not that shouldn't take CBD it's exactly like you said we have to sort of adjust the doses of those prescription drugs while we're titrating up or dropping down that CBD dose we hope this information was helpful as you start to look at CBD products and start working them into your routine if you do have more questions drop them below we are looking forward to providing more information on these topics so we'll see you again in the future", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a

"hi I'm dr. Joe Namath I'm a periodontist in Southfield Michigan and I want to talk a little bit today about CBD or CBD oil cannabidiol CBD CBD oil can be derived from the marijuana plant or it can be derived from the hemp plant it does not have THC in it THC is the ingredient that causes one to get high so this does not have that in it so it doesn't cause you to get high but it is used for pain control and many people it can be used as a as a rub to help control pain in children it may help control seizures it may help reduce anxiety but today I want to talk about the possible role of CBD in the mouth in oral health and specifically on your gum tissue so there was a study using rats what they did was they induce gum disease or periodontal disease in these rats by using certain kinds of wires that irritate the gum tissue and these rats were given CBD actually there were two groups of rats a control group that did not receive the CBD and the experimental group that did receive the CBD now the CBD was given in the form of injection and of course when you brush your teeth you're not going to be injecting CBD they found that at the end of the trial period the rats that had been given the CBD had much less bone destruction they healed much faster and their gums were much healthier relative to the rats in the control group that did not receive the CBD so CBD by the way CBD is now a buzzword you could hear it everywhere and you're gonna hear even more about it because a lot of people think it's the holy grail well it's not the Holy Grail but it may be helpful in certain situations and maybe it's even helpful in the mouth it does tend to reduce inflammation it doesn't kill bacteria so there are some toothpaste some very strong toothpastes that have ant bacterial agents in them and those antibacterial agents kill most or all of the bacteria in the mouth even the good ones on the other hand there are now toothpastes that have CBD incorporated in the toothpaste and these do not destroy the good bacteria but they enable the good bacteria to to proliferate and continue to grow and minimize the harm of the bad bacteria also a great role for CBD is it does reduce anxiety and so it might be very helpful for patients to take some CBD CBD oil something with CBD before a dental appointment to reduce their anxiety of course in our dental office there's no anxiety because we never cause any patients any pain but basically if one has anxiety it does tend to help reduce anxiety and it's very effective for that in a future video I want to talk more about CBD and specifically I want to talk about marijuana and actually smoking marijuana because as opposed to CBD or CBD oil which could have a therapeutic role I think the jury is still out a bit on it marijuana and the smoke actually is probably and is harmful to the gum tissue because the smoke tends to dry out the gum tissue and may reduce the blood supply to the gum tissue so there's a big difference between smoking marijuana which has THC typically and CBD which doesn't so I'm going to talk more about these subjects marijuana CBD in the future but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of potentially what may be going on now and I want to remind you to keep your mouth healthy because if your mouth is healthy I guarantee your body will be healthier subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd love to hear from you and have a great day restore your smile and your health visit dr.

Jones's top 6070 veterinary home remedies encourage you to click the link in the box below and sign up the CBD for dogs and cats I'm putting three minutes on the clock starting now so what is CBD well are about a hundred different ingredients found in the cannabis plant called cannabinoids CBD is called cannabidiol there's one of those 100 green specific therapeutic properties but it's very unlike THC and that it's non psychoactive I have the plant here you know just for show to make things more interesting not really part of CBD THC medical marijuana but it's pretty well there's a thing called the endocannabinoid system or ECS it's found in all mammals you know such as you and I the poodle here and even sleeping Murray so our brains our dog's brains our cat's brains it normally produces cannabinoids and they attach to different cells throughout the body called cb1 cb2 receptors and it's really important for regulating things you know such as sleep such as memory such as immune response but these specific receptors they can interact with plant drive cannabinoids having all this array of positive benefits [Music] first it can be a powerful pain reliever say you have a middle-aged or aging dog or cat and he or she has some arthritic pain perhaps you've been using some type of traditional veterinary anti-inflammatory this is a really good alternative option there's a pile of research been done in people then of the whole array of studies I'll put some of the links below that were showing some of the specific benefits of CBD and a help for instance for relief of arthritic pain it accomplishes this a number of specific ways most importantly it's a natural anti-inflammatory this is a really good option for both our dogs and especially for our cats those can have such a hard time you know even metabolizing any type of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug the other thing you don't have to give very much you notice for someone like Murray who actually has been limping a little bit lately they were just we're gonna try to I'm just gonna give him a few drops ver Murray's dose here it's only about three to four drops I'm gonna give you a couple drops Murray it has mlct oil in it which makes it potentially enticing for Murray so what let's just try this okay Mary look kitty cat mmm there see that was where you got your three drops you don't mind it [Music] the second big therapeutic benefit its natural seizure control so approximately one-third of dogs in particular that are being treated for seizures they don't respond well to conventional medication I mean these dogs are not responding to traditional meds such as fina barbered whole potassium bromide some of the more expensive expensive any convulsive medications but surprisingly many people with difficult to control epilepsy and many dogs are now responding to this CBD oil there's currently some big studies going on at CSU and they're actually studying epileptic dogs how well they're responding to CBD in some cases relatively low doses are being effective [Music] the third big important point that I see is for disease prevention CBD is naturally anti-inflammatory along with having different properties that just being with any anti-cancer and there's a pile of research backing all this so those specific anti-inflammatory properties they're beneficial for things such as helping prevent did your under brain disease all this array of different organ dysfunction that we're seeing you can say with animals are becoming diabetic you know these dogs are about Cushing's disease our animals that seem to be getting these high high rates of cancer there's a pretty big correlation with inflammation and things that can decrease the level of sort of chronic inflammation those goes play such a big role and ultimately disease prevention so standard CBD oil dose is about one milligram per 10 pounds of body weight daily pretty standard amount of CBD and a 30ml bottle is about 300 milligrams which is what's in here typically you're looking at about 20 drops for each mil so meaning two drops for two drops in here that's gonna give you one milligram doulas doses two milligrams she was beginning four drops twice a day I've already just given her dose earlier I'm not gonna give her any give her any more but it gives you a pretty good sense of you know how you can adequately dose your own dog or cat many guys can also start at half that amount you started you know point five milligrams of CBD pretend pounds of body weight twice daily some guys even just started orders or once daily dose so to low do you I think you could benefit from CBD oil as an ongoing basis yeah yeah I do so those are my top three benefits that I see of CVD for dogs and cat I hope you found this video helpful and useful thanks so much for watching this edition on 3 minute Tuesday the top three uses of CVD in our dogs and cats and once again don't forget about my upcoming webinar next week dr.

This product comes in a 30 ml sized bottle and contains\n300 milligrams of CBD that equals to about five milligrams of full-spectrum\nCBD per recommended half milliliter dose. You can get two flavors at this\nconcentration both all-natural flavored and the cinnamon flavored. Inside the\nbottle you'll get the 300 milligrams of CBD as well as a mcg of fractionated\ncoconut oil as the carrier base you'll also get pure organic peppermint and\ncinnamon extract as the flavor. Something that you might want to keep in mind is\nthat this is an organic product it is single source so that means Elixinol\nonly gets their products from their farms and it does have third-party test\nresults available on their website. Let's take a little bit emini break and talk\nabout the importance of a third-party test result being available you\ndefinitely want to make sure that any CBD product that you take has these test\nresults available whether it is online or via QR code on the bottle that is\nbecause this is the surefire way to know exactly what it is that you're getting\nsince the CBD industry doesn't have standardized processes yet. The very\nfirst thing I noticed when I got this product in the mail is that this label\nis busy check it out you've got a white label on top of a dark blue bottle and\nthe writing isn't a light green color that made it really really really hard\nwith everything that was going on for me to say oh okay I've got\n300 milligram I couldn't really see it at first because of this big huge X and\nall the other stuff that's going on. When I opened it I immediately smelled the\ncinnamon not really too much mint and then when I go to look at it I notice\nthat it's super dark this is pretty typical of a full spectrum oil. The other\nreally great thing about this product is that the dropper is measured so you can\ntake fractions or multiples of the doses which i think is really cool. So the\nfirst thing that you are going to notice when you take this product is that it\nimmediately tastes like cinnamon which if you like cinnamon is a really good\nthing. I didn't really taste any of the earthy or plant-like flavor common in\nmost full spectrum products I really just tasted the cinnamon which i think\nis a big bonus however when you go to swallow it after 60 seconds you\ndefinitely feel that alcohol distillation burn on the back of your\nthroat you can definitely taste the alcohol in this product the recommended\ndose per the instructions on the bottle is about a half a milliliter which is\nabout five milligrams of CBD I tried that the first time and I didn't really\nexperience the benefits that I typically get with a CBD supplement so I had to\nplay around with it in order to find out what my ideal dose was which was in fact\none milliliter or ten milligrams of CBD. Once I figured out my optimal dose it\nwas awesome this product definitely reduces all of the pain that I have and\nit helps me to go to sleep and stay asleep the other really cool thing about\nthis particular product is that only ten milligrams did the trick it didn't make\nme sleepy during the day but it helped me to fall asleep at night and made sure\nall of the pain went away but it didn't leave any residual negative side effects\nwhich I really appreciate when you go to take the product you're gonna have to\nmake sure you push down really hard and kind of squeeze the topper in order to\nget it off the bottle they childproof it which means they adult proof it too\nright and for the purposes of this review I'm just going to take a half a\nmilliliter which you can see on the dropper it goes\npoint five you put it underneath your tongue and you try to hold it there for\nabout 30 seconds they actually recommend 60 seconds. What I absolutely love about\nthe Elixinol 300 milligram cinnamon flavored CBD supplement is that it legit\ntastes like cinnamon I don't taste any of the earthy flavors that are common in\nfull-spectrum products and I absolutely love that so if you are really sensitive\nto the more natural flavored products this is a really good alternative I also\nreally like that only ten milligrams did the trick sometimes with different\nproducts I end up having to take upwards of 30 or more milligrams of CBD to get\nthe pain relief and the sleep aid that I need this product with only 10\nmilligrams in 20-30 minutes it did the trick and I really really liked that I\nalso feel like this particular product comes in at a really good value compared\nto other competitive products with similar concentrations. I only have two\nreal complaints about the Elixinol 300 milligram cinnamon CBD first of all this\npackaging is really busy they really need to clean it up to make it be very\nvisible what you're getting whether or not it's full spectrum and how much of\nthe product that you're gonna get I should be able to see that right when I\nlook at it I shouldn't have to look around at everything to be able to tell\nwhat it is I have I also didn't really love the alcohol burn if you are\nsensitive to that pure grain alcohol taste or burn this is not the product\nfor you because you will definitely have some alcohol flavor in there\nso if this Elixinol product is something that you're interested in you\nneed to know that this bottle comes in a thirty milliliter size it has 300\nmilligrams total CBD inside the bottle which is about five milligrams of CBD\nper suggested one half milliliter dose. There are two flavors natural and\ncinnamon and it uses fractionated coconut oil as the carrier base thank\nyou so much for taking the time to watch this review my name\nis Jennifer Dixon with Green

been complimenting me on my glowy skin been asking me what i've been using and i have been staying very tight-lipped because i wanted to truly try these products out on myself for several weeks before i shared it with you all if it's not something that i would use myself personally or if it's something that i don't like i am not going to share it here with you all on my channel i am so happy to announce that these products are amazing and i am just excited to share them with you so truly beauty sent me their new blue kush line of products and i have been obsessed like i have not been this excited and impressed by a skincare product in a very very very long time so that says a lot as you guys know i am very much so into skincare products and i have recently shifted to more natural skincare products if you all have been following me here for a while i've kind of been leaning more towards the organic skincare products and so when truly reached out to me and asked if they could send me some things i did my research and then i responded by saying yes and so that is what i'm going to be sharing with you all today so the first product that i'm going to be sharing is the blue kush facial oil this stuff is amazing i have used my fair share of facial oils and this one definitely fits the bill now typically with facial oils i tend to only use them at night during my nighttime skincare routine but because i wanted to give you guys a true review i've been using this during the day and at night so because i have the luxury of working from home i've been able to like really really test this out without worrying about you know my skin going crazy because i'm home all day so what i've been doing in the morning after i do my workout i do my morning skincare routine which is just cleansing my face toning and then i've been going in with this facial oil so i've been using the facial oil in combination with spf moisturizer that i use and that's it no makeup no nothing so that's what i've been doing during the day and i've been loving it i have not experienced not one breakout which is one of my like biggest fears so no breakouts no skin irritation this is fragrance free so it does not have a scent at all which is really nice they do use a vegan collagen in it and they also use the oil from 1000 blueberries so this product definitely lives up to the hype definitely recommend this i love the packaging like can we just talk about how beautiful this packaging is i love that it has a little dropper so i just used two to three drops in the morning and two to two to three drops in the evening but in the evening i follow up with my skincare moisturizer for extra you know hydration and in the morning my skin is just so plump and dewy and just calm it's just so so good so definitely recommend this facial oil if you are looking for a facial oil for reference i am combination dry and oily i do have sensitive skin so the fact that i did not experience not one breakout or no irritation says a lot because facial oils do tend to give me breakouts here and there not too much but here and there so i've been impressed with this product if you love blueberries you're going to love these products so the first product is the body scrub and as you can see i have been using it quite a bit now i only use this two to three days a week but this stuff smells amazing it literally smells like blueberry candy it's it's the yummiest smell ever here's what it looks like you may see some water in there because it was just in my shower but literally all i've been doing is rubbing it in my hands really really well because it does give like a nice little lather and then i've just been exfoliating my entire body and when you rinse this off your skin is going to feel so soft and so smooth it's just so good i love love love this body scrub i'll be honest body scrubs is not something that i use often just because i have a hard time finding good ones so when they sent me this i was super excited because i can't tell you the last time i had bought a body scrub so i was definitely in need of one and i just love absolutely everything about it so they do use organic coconuts in it so it does leave your skin a little bit oily after it rinses which is really nice i love that about it overall i've been very impressed by this body scrub i have no complaints my skin loves it and that's all that matters after i do my body scrub and get out the shower i follow up with the blue kush body oil i am a fan of body oils i love any type of body oil i just i just love them this one has been amazing when i get out the shower before i dry off i take about three to four drops of this i put it all over my damp skin and then i go in and then i just pat dry my skin and i tell you like that's all you really need to do and you will definitely see that your skin is so dewy and hydrated and just glowy again the bottle can we just talk about how beautiful the packaging is here so yes i definitely recommend investing in a good body oil especially as we are going into the fall and winter months your skin is going to thank you for the hydration so definitely check this one out for sure if you don't check out anything else i would highly recommend the body oil so after the body oil i go in with the blue kush body lotion this is very lightweight but so hydrating i love that it has a little pump and it smells so so good like blueberry explosion but it's not in a bad way it's not like like cheesy cheap blueberry scent it's like a really nice calming soothing blueberry scent so i've been loving this again another product that i've been using day and night in combination with the body oil these two together are amazing and my skin has never looked and felt better i just love it and i just love using products that are just natural vegan cruelty free no harsh chemicals no like strong fragrances so yes i am here for all the natural products and this makes me happy knowing that i'm using something that's good for my skin and i do feel like it is super effective i do have sensitive skin so if any of these products were not going to work for me my skin would have told me by day two so the fact that i've been able to use these products consistently for two and a half weeks says a lot so yeah guys overall i have been very impressed with the truly beauty products i have no complaints whatsoever i highly recommend everything and i will continue to use it there are some other products that i am definitely eyeing that i want to check out

hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life thought I would chat with you a little bit today about capsules they do come in different sizes strengths and variations and I get a lot of questions about those and what the differences are because there can be some different price points as well I do also have a lot of people ask me that if taking CBD in a capsule is just as good as taking it in a tincture or a raw extract form you know my answer is generally the best CBD is the one that you'll actually take every day so if you know yourself and you know that that grassy earthy hemp flavor that comes from a tincture a raw extract is not for you know you're just not comfortable taking it in a liquid and you'd rather take a capsule then by all means do it the capsules can take a little longer to get to work for you just because your body has to digest them before the CBD can start to do its thing but the end result should be the same for you whether you're taking it from a tincture or a capsule so I might say that I've got three basic variations of capsules soft gels traditional powder capsules and then what I call a hybrid which is kind of somewhere in between the two so soft gels I have right here is from Entourage oops almost ripped it this is just encapsulated hemp oil you can see it's kind of a light and amber color it's squishy and if I were to stick a knife in the end of this guy then that oil would squeeze right out so I actually have some customers that say that they like to buy these capsules just because they know their serving size because those milligrams are sat per capsule so they actually buy these I'm just a competitor a knife in the end squeeze it out under their tongue and go on about their day so I have soft gels from Entourage from Tuesday hemp oil and also from Plus CBD so these are just the traditional hemp oil extract that's been encapsulated next one is or the other end of the spectrum I guess we should say is the traditional powdered capsule and that is just what it sounds so this has been through more processing to take that CBD oil and get it down to a powder to stay and then fill up these little Koen capsule guys so this is been a little bit more processed these are from plus CBD great product super popular and a little bit lower price point but it is it is surprising to some people to see that it really is a powdered capsule so really traditional then we've got what I call the hybrid in dhoka falls into this category as does CBD FX so that's another one that I would call a hybrid so looks more like that first softgel a little bit squishy but you wouldn't be able to just stick a knife in the end and squeeze the oil out there's more of a paste and this it's a little bit thicker consistency paste like but not full powder and capsule so kind of somewhere in between the two those I have in all different variations I've got 10 25 and 50 milligrams strengths so I think it's an easier way likely for the manufacturer to take that humble extract not worry about thinning it out or adding any oil carriers to make it a soft gel but kind of leave it as sort of that waxy middle ground definitely thinner and not powdered but not a full-on soft gel so those are kind of the three variations personally I prefer a soft gel or in that middle hybrid which I'm sure is not actually what they call it but that's because I'm kind of a baby and I don't like to take regular capsules it's just not my preference as a human so I like the soft gels but everybody has their own their own preference and in their own best way which is why we do carry multiple variations because they want to make sure that there's something for everybody so I hope that this helped a little bit and I hope that you have an awesome day always email or give me a coffee you've got any questions that email is support at green wellness live.com support at green wellness live.com or you can always give me a buzz at eight eight eight

of potential that cbd has to offer the classic and versatile cbd oil is your go-to but you have to know how to take it here's how to get started with hemp bomb's cbd oil first choose the right concentration at hemp bombs we offer 5 potencies ranging from milligrams to 5 000 milligrams so there's a cbd concentration made specifically for you and everything life throws your way next use the graduated dropper to measure out your ideal dose we recommend 10 to 15 milligrams if you're just starting out so with 12 and a half milligrams of cbd per serving half a dropper of our 750 milligram tincture would be the perfect size although you can also take a full dropper of our 300 milligram oil or a quarter dropper of our 1 500 milligram oil drop the oil underneath your tongue and hold it there for 60 seconds this allows your body to fully absorb the cbd into your system finally record your dosage in a cbd journal and observe how it made you feel throughout the day and after a few days if you don't notice much change you can start to gradually increase your intake by 5 milligrams remember cbd oil can take up to an hour to kick in so time your dose right decide whether you prefer an energized morning an afternoon pick-me-up or a calmer regardless if you're a beginner or experienced with cbd our cbd oil can help you achieve your wellness goals and make every day more comfortable you", "ilwbITtqgOA": "I sent hemp bombs to a lab to see if it's real I'll give you a little hint it bombed do me a favor and just go look at a bunch of reviews of hemp bombs and then come back and watch this because you're gonna be shocked because these results are a little different than all the happy lies you're being told let's see my lab results they claimed 300 milligrams of CBD and we found only a hundred and seven milligrams of CBD or 64 point four percent less bombed F rating 107 milligrams not three hundred it really is shocking that all these great reviews out there they get a commission for helping sell this product by doing reviews this isn't in my interest to do but the truth is more important and those reviews aren't gonna change after they see my lab results they'll just carry on more on that in a second here's the official lab test it's just one test I don't claim all products will test this way hold that thought too about one test price obviously it's ridiculous because this is based on the lab report and when you're missing a whole bunch of CBD the price goes way up here's the crazy part absolutely insane nbc6 investigators found their 15 milligram gummies contained only 2.2 milligrams of CBD not 15 2.2 CBS 58 found their products didn't even contain CBD none no CBD and they tested at two different labs none nbc4 purchased five hemp bombs products and they had less than half the amount advertised bomb this is a huge company out of Florida how are they doing this I am blown away oh yeah they also own nature script apparently and we tested that product and the results were very similar they bombed I just can't believe there are so many YouTube reviews out out there saying how great this product is in so many review sites when clearly if you just if you just google it if you just go on the news you can see all of these it's not hidden all of these negative portes well this can't go on forever share this subscribe like and I

get one of their products one day and the fact that these are gifted is honestly such a blessing so thank you truly beauty i've been using the blueberry kush face oil prior to this video because i wanted to kind of experiment with it and see how it go like a few days before i even filmed the video and i'm like flat out amazed because of how like brightening and illuminating it left my skin i'm not wearing any makeup right now it's just my skin and i love love love love the shine that it's been leaving on my face i was actually getting a lot of compliments from my family and friends and i feel so much more comfortable in my skin because i know i have clear skin but i also have some textured skin and this surprisingly like calms them down so this is very calming illuminating brightening and detoxifying insanely detoxifying and it's no it has no harsh chemicals at all and yeah but there's no harsh chemicals and i used this body oil on some very very dry areas on my skin after i took a shower and usually i would like use other body oils but they never really restored that hydration that i was looking for until i used this and i'm not sugar coating anything at all because you guys know i have sensitive skin to know that this just restored all the hydration i needed like in my elbows my knees my ankles the driest areas in my like of my on my skin it's really good to have so i was really really amazed my i've been pushing my mom to use it too so now don't even get me started on the scrub but it's so exfoliating it has organic coconut in it and i'm a coconut lover it's very high performing and when i say that it just it left my skin so baby smooth right after it was so exfoliating i left the ingredients to settle into my skin so i can just like really soak up all that moisture right and i really felt that it left my skin even brighter like i was so comfortable to wear shorts because normally after i exfoliate my skin it doesn't really leave like a healthy glow but this one did and i think it's because like the vegan uh collagen in it but dang i know for sure that i'm gonna be getting more of this because i think it's like almost halfway done because of how amazing i've been using it for a few days now and it smells delightful it's a sugar-based scrub of course and it detoxifies and illuminates your skin as well and it's super nourishing like [Music] and i've never had personally i love lotions i have a bunch like i have a ton but this one i really really like how it's super super dewy and i really love the texture of it i just love how it feels on my skin sometimes i like leaving them kind of in the cold i know like the cold seasons rolling in too so of course when i have sensitive skin my skin tends to dry up a lot and sometimes it comes to a point where it hurts and this is like super smooth super soft and super illuminating that's what it does and that's what it could do for your skin and it's so freaking soft like this is what it does to your skin and y'all i'm like so surprised of how dewy and soft it leaves your skin it's super nourishing hydrating brightening calming i would just keep on saying it it's just so amazing i've been

i just i need i need i need to use this on a daily i don't know it just feels like super fresh and that's what i really love in a body care line this body care line is amazing and like i said with the face oil i always apply some like every night so that's what i'm gonna do right now don't mind me from india just in the background it feels so good on my skin i put like one drop on like each side of my face because a little bit goes a long way and that's what i love in this product because you don't have to use a lot like literally two drops does the job so it lasts long as well it's like super calming and it feels really really nice on my skin so i do this 30 minutes before i head to bed just because i would want to allow all the ingredients to soak into my skin i it's like you feel it working it's not anything like tingling sensation nothing it's just like you feel relaxed she work love how it left my skin so smooth throughout the few couple days i did not break out i did have some like little mini pimples on top but this calmed it down and i was just like [Music] like dang okay so let's do kind of like a before and after this is before so i have nothing on like this area and

making sure that we take care of all those important challenges that you might be facing I know lots of us are battling with the anxiety depression pain is actually a challenge for most of us and today we've got a special product for you from Moringa Foods International and it goes by the name of CBD oil you might have heard about it but today I'm not alone in the studio about the CEO of Moringa Foods international to make sure that they can give you the lowdown and make sure you understand fully what CBD oil is about Jay welcome today thank you for having me in the studio and thank you for joining us and I know lots of people have heard about CBD oil but what many are sure of how to use it what exactly is it and this is why today we've got you to explain and give our viewers more information when it comes to CBD oil thank you so be a pleasure to share that information with you yes let's start with the one that we've got I like you if you write premium this is the premium CBD oil and this is from hemp that's right and I wanted to start by saying here we've got the six hundred milligram that we've got for you today and I like the fig that we always about good prices here TV more you're not going to pay 750 rounds and because we care about you and we want you to save and so that your money can go a long way you're going to pay six hundred and fifty rounds that's a saving of a hundred rounds so that's the premium hemp CBD or 600 milligrams tell us more about EJ you mentioned the fact that we use the word premium on our label the reason for that is because it denotes quality very high quality and high efficacy okay we expect the results to be positive on every single application or use we we see of what the benefits there which we're looking at pain relief we're talking about increasing appetite I hope we're not talking about overeating they're reducing stress promoting healthy cell growth and of course I like the part of the nausea and fatigue and also the brain health can you let's touch mostly on the pain aspect because I know most people are using lots of money on painkillers they are using lots of money on energy supplements they're using men of many on sleeping aids but and I know as we were talking Elia on you spoke about CBD or being able to assist in most of those conditions most definitely and without the side effects of a lot of what people are using currently so son if you look at the used to cost factor yes you'll find that it's cost-effective for the results that you're getting but I must point out something very important about as efficient as CBD is yeah it's a non psychoactive is very important because most people will always confuse and say ok the hemp one and the one that comes from marriage one what's the difference well it's actually taking on a high we're actually saying viewers when you talk about the premium hemp extract from you know from from the marina food I international there is no high that's associated with this is not psychoactive so this is actually a very good one if you look at the comparison there look at that we could it contains 0.3 percent or less of the THC the THC is actually the component that actually you know causes the high you think we always throw this the temps can you actually tell us what so what you'll find is that th is the psychoactive ingredient in both hemp and cannabis Jen drop the gentle plant species but what you find is Barlow be required to remove it from all our products okay so the maximum usage per day is twenty milligrams legally so be ensure that is absolutely no THC definitely below the legal limit I can see as you can see there we've got the comparison quite nicely there to make sure that you know we can understand that there is a difference and we look at that THC and actually how the plant look like but when we look at it we're saying this the one from hemp does not actually cause problems in the sense that it is not psycho active not have lots of THC so I think just to tell our viewers more about that the main difference because the too many greens being CBD and THC you find that in in marriage one I have got more of the THC and less of CBD and it's actually the reverse when it comes to the hemp one we've got more of the CBD and less in fact almost if I can variant very negligible and in fact what we do is we have a certificate of analysis that actually shows the breakdown of every ingredient in our products and you'll find that the MP is about ninety-nine point eight percent yes and then you get CBDs CBN's and CB G's that'll make out the difference I like the fact that okay you guys we have got the three hundred milligrams are on offer today our call center agents are waiting for your call zero eight six one a triple zero one seven three we are saving you a hundred runs normally you would pay 750 runs but today we are giving it to you for six hundred and fifty rounds of course they also do make a three hundred milligram which you can also purchase so but today what's on offer is the six hundred milligram and when you took dosages it's important because people want to know this is a 30 mil bottom in terms of how one would take for example if I'm taking it for pain how much would I take well each bottle contains about 600 drops okay and you only required on the 300 yarn you required to take about six drops three times a day if required okay because you determined that by your pain factor so we normally measure pain from zero to what to tare to ten so if you in about the three to four factor region yes then you'll use this like normal users following the the dosage instructions and they'll probably last for about two two to three months okay if it's for insomnia then you don't have to take it all day long just take it before bed time until outreach with your city so we've got lots of people I know what battling to go to sleep because we using lots of stimulants during the day and that affects how we'll then you know I produce those hormones that are supposed to help us to sleep we're telling you today that we've got a premium product premium hemp CBD oil which is going to help you so if it's way insomnia one we'll just take it before they go to bed actually so you just how many drops would you take so on the 300 you probably take about six drops okay you can actually determine yourself and we need to take you know how much is enough for yourself and is a dosage charge that's that comes together bottle people normally worry about overdosing jealous would you really say it would be a concern when it comes to your products the premium see video that we've got in terms of overdosing No so science in depending scientific studies show that with the removal of the THC there's absolutely no psychoactive activity which means you can't overdose quite quite honestly you could finish most of that bottle in one guy just like you sleep so we are giving you a product that is actually very safe for you to take the only side effect would be you'll be wasting your money if you took all of it so take it as directed so that it can last for about a month or two so that you can get all those benefits that we have shown you there we're looking at pain relief I've told you lots of money is going into pain killers lots of money is going into you know taking care of anxiety and stress lots of money is actually being put into sleeping tablets and if you look at it how better you know to just get one product that will give you all those benefits a 650 runs only 650 runs we're saving you a hundred grands because normally you would pay six hundred and seven hundred and fifty runs for the six hundred milligram strength J in terms of far when you're taking the product are there any people that are exempted are any people that should not take this product that CBD today studies have shown that you could actually use it anytime and anybody can use it so in age groups you check in kids can also take it again but control number of drops okay and in association with the discussion you have with your medical practitioner most definitely so we're actually telling you that at least the good thing is now your medical professional they actually know more about CBD oil that's why it is actually available since it's a product that is actually legal that you can purchase from your outlets there your retail outlets but we are saying to you today let's save you money instead of going out there to pay 750 runs pay 600 runs 650 runs for this 600 milligrams strength but we also told you that the 300 milligram strength is also available for so this is CBD oil to take care of your anxiety your stress manage your stress well make sure that you can sleep better I like the power of sleep because J I can tell you if we look at the statistics lots of people are not sleeping well and for me I value sleep a lot because if you look at it we're supposed to be sleeping eight hours a day that translates to about a third of our life so for someone was six years old you should have been sleeping for what 20 years so that's the value of sleep because that's when now you recharge the batteries that's when you actually get to be able to wake up energized most of us are battling they start their day on a cup of coffee why because they are lacking energy how about now using a product that's going to help you to make sure that now you don't have to depend on those stimulants you don't have to depend on those sugary drinks to get your energy we're talking about the premium hemp CBD oil and we've got Jay here telling us more about it Jay what else do our viewers you think it will be valuable for viewers to know about your product it's very important to

the same time in the calming with a calming effect that it has yes makes you more efficient that anything else that you do that is actually very nice to you so those of you who might not know he just mentioned the serotonin and the dopamine serotonin and dopamine are hormones and dopamine is the one that normally that's associated with addiction so when you burn a good product like your premium hemp it actually helps you not to get too addicted to substances you're getting the feel-good effects quite nicely and the serotonin is also that hormone that makes sure that you can control how much you eat you do not go over Egypt but a healthy appetite that's why the CBD or is gonna help you with your appetite but also the same hormone is used at night to produce another hormone that's called

this is TV more and this has been the health segment and today telling you more about CBD oil [Music]", "jymg-5bwAI4": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the indica raw hemp 3% the indica raw hemp 3% has 300 milligrams of full-spectrum supercritical co2 extracted him inside each bottle the bottle is 10 milliliters and has about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper full which is about one milligram of CBD per drop if you are one to stay up to date on all of the latest in the hemp industry make sure you like and subscribe to our Channel the indica story is actually really cool this is the very first brand to sell hemp products online they actually controlled the entire product from the little bitty seed until you get the bottle they have a little over two thousand acres at the time of this recording all in Northern Europe Denmark area when you order your product because it is both in Europe and in the US and headquarters in California it takes about three days like I got mine just in under three days from the time that I placed my order online until the time that I got it in my house so they're really really on target with their shipping times too another really great thing about the indica raw hemp number three or three percent is that it includes both CBD and CBD a so the difference between the two are mainly the biggest difference is the CBD a is the non-heated the non decarboxylated oh say that one really fast and so you're getting slightly different benefits because you get to have both CBD a and CBD both of them are great for inflammation anxiety and things of that nature but the fact is you're you're getting both of them in this particular product so that helps to aid in the entourage effect so each bottle is 10 milliliters it only has one flavor and that is natural it is very natural and like I said one drop is about one milligram and a full dropper is about thirty milligrams it comes with a non marked glass dropper and you'll notice that it's very dark it's a very very dark full-spectrum product for me I normally don't take thirty full milligrams of CBD although I did do it at night and it was amazing to help me sleep so during the day I generally take about a quarter of a dropper because I am not good enough to count those drops underneath my tongue so let's try it indica uses a hemp seed oil as its carrying base and it is non-gmo it is organic and it is created or manufactured in a GMP certified facility that means every single time you take this product every single time you buy this product you know exactly what you're going to get it is a very high quality product with consistent results from their test which by the way they do a really good job of showing you and giving you access to their tests so on the side of the box you'll see a little bitty UPC code and on the back is actually digits that are stamped on there with it looks like a date and a four digit code that was a little confusing to me at first honestly when I went in to type in the batch number but basically it's the last four digits that you need for the batch it's also on the side of the bottle so if we stand it up and then turn it you're gonna see that same those same dates and four digits in order to find the test results you have to go to their website and there is a tab on the far right where it's quality control and then what you do is you search for they give it to you in like 50 batch numbers so you have to go into your drop down to about your 50 range and then find it let's dive a little deeper into the test results so something that indica does really really really well is they tell you everything probably even more than most people want to know you're gonna get the microbial reports you're gonna see how they tested for pesticides which by the way both of those tested non-deductible non-detectable and then they show you the different terpenes as well as cannabinoids inside their product so something that I definitely wanted to make sure that you are aware of that indica did is this is called indica raw hemp 3 for 3 percent if you look at the test results you will actually find that it's actually a little bit more than 3 percent of the total concentration it's like 3.3 percent and I know that that's not a ton of a difference however in an age where everyone's trying to round up and sell you more I really appreciated the fact that these guys were like hey it's just 3% even though they're giving you more than that and so that just kind of spoke volumes to me about the corporate culture and what they're trying to offer their consumers so you're gonna notice that it's got a very nice packaging it's a pretty heavy Winkle blue if you've seen some movies not quoting any on the outside it's very clear and easy to read and you're gonna see that it's 3% this is actually labeled a little bit differently than products in the US which are usually labeled as per dropper full of milligrams of CBD or the total amount of CBD in the bottle this is labeled as a percentage of the entire bottle which is it was a little confusing to me as an American consumer but once I started digging into it it actually made a whole bunch of sense it does have one milligram of CBD per dropper so you know if you're taking a half a dropper that's about 15 drops or about 15 milligrams of CBD so when you get it you're gonna notice that on both of them it does have the batch number but it also talks about all of the different products that are inside of it and so you can see that they actually have omegas in it and they it is using a hip seed oil as the carrier base okay so now let's actually talk about taking this product the first thing that you're going to notice when you open it up is it has a very pungent smell like you don't even have to get it that close to smell you can smell it from here it's very strong very earthy flavored and I actually smell kind of a bunch of pine needles almost and that's actually due to the terpenes terpenes inside the canvas planter what gives it its flavor and this one tests really high for limonene which is the same turkey and that's found in lemons but believe it or not it's also found in pine needles which is something I learned while doing this review and so it made a whole bunch of sense to me that I finally like that's why I smell pine needles it is very very strong and the flavor does stay with you so definitely keep that in mind when you are considering purchasing this product however I want you to tell I wanted to tell you that the first time I used it I used 15 drops which is about a half a dropper full about 15 milligrams of CBD I took it and within 30 minutes I fell asleep and guess what ladies and gentlemen I stayed asleep the whole night which is basically a miracle so this is very very very effective I didn't need to take it the next day because I didn't really hurt and so I found myself just supplementing with this as I needed throughout the day which sometimes it was never sometimes it was in the middle of the day like when I was ready to pull my hair out and then I would again I wouldn't have to even take a full dropper full a half a dropper or even a quarter of a dropper was enough to take the anxiety away and help me to get focused and get a whole bunch of stuff done actually this just happened I was working on something and I got really really stressed out so I took a quarter of a dropper which is about seven or eight drops and I lost complete track of time and I was almost late to my daughter's piano lessons because I was so focused so this stuff is very effective albeit it is also very very very strongly flavored so now let's get down to the Nitty Gritty when you go to purchase the indica raw hemp 3 you'll notice that the value of it's actually pretty good it's a very I can they consider this a moderate strength with about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper I consider this more a little bit on the higher strength dose a higher concentration it does come in a 10 milliliter size bottle which is a little slower but it is very effective so cost per milligram it's very very very reasonably priced and you'll really appreciate that you'll also notice that it's it works like a little bit goes a long way it's very very very effective at what it does to help reduce anxiety reduce residual pain and to help you sleep and so you don't need as much which helps to maybe cushion the purchase price just a bit the one thing that you definitely definitely want to keep in mind is that this stuff is strong flavored like it's strong and so if flavor profiles definitely get to you if that's something that you can't get over even with a little bit of water you might still taste it keep that in mind with this indica rub but oh my gosh it's not like you're sitting here taking this as your dessert you're taking this because you're seeking relief from anxiety or you're taking this to help you sleep or maybe some relief from inflammation so if you take it with that in mind like I'm not taking this because it tastes good I'm taking it because it freakin works then just take it and then go chase it with your cake okay and then you'll definitely love the indica or all three before we go remember that this indica raw hemp 3% has one milligram of CBD per dropper or about thirty milligrams of CBD per dropper full it does have about 2.2 percent THC which is the legal limit in Europe and you can get it both in Europe and in the u.s. it is strongly flavored so keep that in mind but it is such an effective product and the price point is so easy for you to get into in my opinion it's really worth your it's worth your time and your investment to try this product out let me know if you've tried it I for one love it I definitely will be keeping this around my house it is very effective it works it does taste strong but I actually I really appreciate how little I have to take to get all of the benefits from the CBD and I also appreciate the fact that it isn't that expensive to to procure if you will I'd love to know what your thoughts are if you've tried it and if you want to learn even more about all of the different hip products on the market make sure you like and

I'M TELLING YOU EVERYBOD", "h4Mu0-S22Ac": "hi it's Natalia with green valley nation and in today's video I would like to review for you pharma hemp CBD drops 3 percent in today's video about farm ahem CBD drops 3 percent I'm gonna share with you only the most important information but if you would like to read the full review and see the Leptis results you have to visit our website a Green Valley nation you can find there many other articles about CBD farm ahem this small family-owned company that manufactures a product from hemp a grown on farms in Slovenia and also Croatia and the hemp is hunt harvested then it's dried in a very low temperatures below 35 degrees and then it is xeb is extracted through a supercritical co2 extraction whole production process is compliant with GMP conditions and you may ask yourself why is it so important and I'm happy to inform you that we have a blog post just about that so I would recommend you to visit and read it Pharma hab offers a wide variety of different products with CBD like creams eliquids bombs but also toothpaste with CBD mouthwash with CBD and even CBD crystals farm ahem CBD drops 3 percent offer 300 milligrams of CBD in this 10 min little bottle and because it's a full spectrum hemp extract you can find out also other cannabinoids terpenes and other nutrients while purchasing that product you can choose in which oil you would like it to be diluted you then choose an olive oil or hemp seed oil I decided on a olive oil whenever you are buying CBD product you should always ask producer for the certificate of analysis happily in this case the lab test results were published online unfortunately the part number from my bottle didn't really match the purchase batch number on a documentation so I decided to write to a producer and ask why is that and apparently samples are tested in the laboratory they just receive different batch numbers and then they are the oils are put into the bottles and then again bottle receives different batch number that's why there is a difference so right now I'm gonna I'm gonna analyze for you the lab test results for the latest batches and for four days oil for the for the oil which is like three percent so laboratory usually provides you with that profile of cannabinoids and in this case the lab test results revealed that this this oil contains one point twenty one percent of CVD and also two point zero two percent of CBD a so the acidic form of CBD so overall the amount of CBD was three point twenty three percent so it is slightly more than it is advertised on a bottle so that's very good I'm happy that I'm receiving slightly more CBD then it is set on a on a label lab results are so proved that this oil contains a legal amount of THC which in this case was 0.03 percent so it's really insignificant amount of CBD so if you are using this oil in a regular doses therefore this product definitely won't get you high in the next part of this video review I'm gonna share with you my personal experiences with that product and unfortunately the first thing I have to mention is that I had to wait for this product for a very long time I think it was two or three weeks and as you know when you order something online you usually usually expect that it's gonna come within a few days so in this case I had to wait a little bit longer for it and that's a main disadvantage besides that I have to say that I have positive experiences with that product as you can see it has a nice dark design the bottle is dark so it prevents the sunlight to go into inside the bottle it has also built-in dropper so you apply it with the drops it comes with their cardboard box and on the cardboard box you can find information the producer about ingredient list also there's something very interesting because it says on a cardboard box that you should use it topically for skin application when needed I was very surprised that they do not give you information how much of these oil of that oil you should take so I decided to write a product to write to producer and ask him about that and they told me that of course this this CBD oil is safe for human consumption unfortunately because of the local loss they couldn't register it as a food supplement therefore it's it's sort of like a cosmetic but you can use it but because they don't give you a recommended dose I would say that parameters product is not for a person who would start the journey with CBD is probably for more experienced users which probably I am so I I didn't have a trouble to to take I just started with a few drops twice a day and then I sigh I build up my dose and but before I'm I start talking about my effect with this oil I would like to examine it closely so first of all smell of course it smells like a like a hemp but it's nothing super unpleasant but I would say that it's slightly slightly stronger right now I will take a little bit of the oil to the dropper and as you can see it has a light brown color and also right now I'm gonna show you how I'm taking it and so of course I'm taking a lip of the pitch in the dropper and then I'm gonna put it under my tank and allow it to dissolve for like one minute I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of the taste of this oil for me it tastes slightly too bitter and I got that that sort of spicy feeling in my throat when I'm taking it but it's not the worst right and let me right now tell you a little bit about the effect so I use a during winter and I must say that within one two weeks I've noticed a significant difference in my mood because usually during winter I am prone to seasonal depression and I've got a mood swings but this time it's really lessened my mood swings and also I would say that it really helped me to sleep I wouldn't say that if I would take it at night I wouldn't say that I would fall asleep easier but I've noticed that I slept much better I didn't wake up during night and in the morning I would say that I felt much more energized and I didn't need coffee in the morning to keep me going during the day another thing I noticed that this oil really helps to speed up the recovery and may help you with the pains for example if you are practicing yoga because that's sort of a pain I usually feel for example after very intensive yoga session I would have some muscle sores but while using this oil I I think that my mouth my muscles were recovered way quicker I think that we are approaching the end of this review and if you would like to read more details about this product please please visit our website and the review is waiting for you there and also if you have any comments or questions about this product please leave a comment in the comment section down below I'm really excited to try a new product if you have any recommendation if you'd like me to test any CBD product please let me know meanwhile thank you so much for watching I'm wishing you a good day and

at least in my state like the past four months it has exploded I mean it's everywhere and you'll note that more customers they have appreciated the actual use of CBD oil - it's no longer that it's a secret of the wonders that it casts upon us it does absolutely amazing things it normally used for medical purposes and it can actually solve a numerous amount of health problems in another one of my videos I actually talked about my my use in my experience with it I have a lot of anxiety I used to be very anxious especially in college I tried I tried a number of solutions but nothing worked I ended up talking to a friend and he told me about trying CBD oil and in this case vaak siddhi the oil from hemp bombs so you're gonna note that they normally sell products online and I didn't only buy this oil for my own use but bought one for my pet - and it's manufactured one of the most concentrated CBD oils that you can find out there there are so many reasons why I like this particular oil and help me solve problems for me family members and other random people mainland for me it's anxiety insomnia for my boyfriend insomnia - inflammation nausea vomiting it reduces your blood sugar levels acne which I talked about in another video pain chronic pain which you talked about as well so before I bought this oil I actually checked there third party lab test results of course it actually indicated that this oil is super effective it's just everything that CBD oil supposed to do this has been tested do it it can help reduce pain inflammation in the body if you're suffering from anxiety it can help reduce it and this is where the testing of this product actually came in for me was due to me wanting to maintain fix whatever I could do to diminish even if it was just a fraction of my anxiety which I can say now it did and it's still reducing my anxiety by a very huge margin a big one for me is customer service with this company and that's with anything in life I'm like really big on customer service if there are a million products out there on the market and people choose your brand or your company out of the millions then you just reward them simply by good customer service respect timely replies information most of all patience and hemp balms personally they have really good customer service I contacted them and I asked them a few questions about my cell on their site and their product and they got back to me in a timely manner and this included the dosages and the effects of taking the product so another thing is I didn't have to wait for weeks before getting the product so I mean I got this in I got the product in three days and this was like a bit a bit quick compared to companies that take you know mostly take weeks for delivery so I mean I'm anxious come on I do you think I can wait but it's worth noting that CBD oil it comes in potencies ranging from 300 milligrams to 4,000 milligrams per bottle mine's a thousand don't let the dose confuse you I did another video on recommendations of the dosage and how to take CBD so this oil also comes in two different flavors they have juicy melon and those who like like the more cool natural they have peppermint you can choose have either of those to whatever your heart desires or whatever Suseo tasties and you can trust that it's not gonna leave like a bad weird aftertaste in your mouth it doesn't they don't taste like weird artificial so yeah you're just gonna test out and see which one you like the most and a huge thing for me and many others is that they focus on pure CBD oil that means that you're gonna be enjoying the cat the powerful cannabinoid as it is found in nature in addition they also normally conduct several tests before releasing their products that's huge - and so you know that you're getting the best a one you can rest assure that when you try the hand balm so you're gonna get quality product so buy CBD oil for yourself even for your pet like I said the pet balms and what I got this for my dog is Xander who has extreme anxiety issues like he I took on more work and I'm not home as much he tears up stuff when I come home I'm like there's just stuff everywhere if it's paper hits everywhere so separation anxiety is really bad and it's actually gotten better with this and actually the first week I became home was last week there was not a trace of anything torn up in my house which I was really surprised by the neighbor hasn't complained in a week either about him howling when I'm gone so that's another bonus I didn't expect another thing to happen with this is that heat during the summer time he gets this weird rash inori underneath his stomach my grasses grows really fast and I think he gets chiggers so it doesn't usually go away until wintertime so since he's been taking this this is the 300 milligram that I got him he does not have that rash anymore so I'm really really surprised this is August the hottest months not even September yet and his rash is almost completely gone so they offer high potency pets to be the oil it's available 120 fill 125 milligrams 300 milligrams is what I have here thousand milligrams for various breed sizes and Dulce needs so for more information on their oils guys you can check them out at hip bomb.com CBD oils and also check out on their site for your pets and yeah just let me know if you've tried hip bombs before if you try any other one that you would recommend but definitely check these out and like share comment and I'll see you guys the next video", "hqIokruGgdM": "they call me crazy cuz I'm facing Alma Giants they try to scare me into thinking I can fight it you tell me I should never even think of trying it'd be nice to speak I'm gonna live out of the fire [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "dd5eIU55KFA": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to be talking about something very hmm I don't want to say controversial but I'm gonna be talking about CBD well first and foremost just as a disclaimer I want to make it very clear that if you're not over 21 this video is not for you at all vaping is not cool it's not a toy it's not a fun thing to do the only thing you should be putting in your lungs is air guys and also just like any supplement you would take I would suggest you to check with your doctor if this is safe for you specifically because everyone has a different body everyone takes different medications and a bunch of different things so definitely make sure you ask your doctor about CBD and how it might affect you and your personal health well I vape CBD this is a vape and a vapes get a lot of scrutiny and things like that like babes are like demonized now I do not vape nicotine and vaping nicotine is like vaping a cigarette basically a lot of times people who are addicted to cigarettes or addicted to nicotine or whatever they use vape systems or mods or cigarettes and things like that to help them get off of the nicotine a Vig device is a vape device that uses like coils and cotton basically the liquid that you put in here soaks up the cotton the coil heats the cotton up and produces a vapor I got a vape to specifically vape CBD and I tried this because I know other people who vape but they usually bake nicotine and I heard about CBD and vaping CBD and also how CBD can help anxiety and a bunch of other claims which I'm going to get into if you guys more like information about how much these things cost or actual information reviews about the vape then I'll let you know what I made clear is I do not condone using drugs or anything like that so definitely definitely definitely make sure anytime I'm using a drug it's under a doctor's supervision and yeah like everyone's on this go green and natural remedies and stuff like that but just like you can be naturally allergic to peanuts oh but they are a natural angry you can eat organic peanuts a natural thing and have a reaction to it so with anything natural chemical whatever what have you you always want to check with your doctor CBD is separate from THC which is hetra Hydra been a vinyl CBD is cannabidiol it is a chemical compound extracted from the cannabis plant and unlike THC it does not get you high it does not have any psychoactive effects there's different ways you can take it you can take it as a vapor you can also take it as like an aerosol like um spray in your mouth you can also take it as a like as like drops and drop it under your tongue or the side of your cheek and things like that it's all a shock of CBD and a bunch of beauty products makeup skincare lotions body care soaps a bunch of stuff like you go in a store and CBD is all over the place but let me just tell you the claims and just facts about CBD there are claims that it helps relieve pain osteoarthritis and even cancer though there are claims that it works with your brain to kind of alter serotonin having low levels of serotonin cause depression and also anxiety so I guess they claimed that CBD comes in and alters your serotonin too I guess high in the level of serotonin and regulates that for your serotonin levels to be healthier therefore helping ease anxiety the FDA does not regulate CBD so what this means is a bunch of these products in say CBD and you don't even know what amount of CBD is in it you don't even know if it's effective because you have no way to know how much in at what percentage is the is the ingredient active the best studies that I can find on CBD is tested on animals and my problem with testings on animals is that we are not animals so much studies have been done on animals that are just not up to par with the biology of a human so a lot of these testings have been inconclusive oh my personal experience with CBD is I took 600 milligrams and 1000 milligrams I had different effects with both of them and I swapped both of them out like using some here and some there it wasn't the whole month I did like one thing I don't think it helps anxiety if you guys know if you guys watch any of my other videos I do have anxiety and adjustment disorder yeah it did not help my anxiety at all the whole month I actually had an anxiety attack this month and yeah I didn't help my anxiety I don't think pretty much anyway it did help short-term pain relief like when I had my cramps during my period it did help ease the pain of the cramps like surprisingly and also you if you like work out and things like that and you get like sore muscles it definitely does help that and me at least I saw that it helped that 1000 milligrams helped more than the 600 the 600 really didn't do much of anything what I also did was suppress my appetite I noticed this while I was taking it I noticed this quickly because I always eat I love food I eat everything and anything in front of me so I really was shocked that it had that effect on me like I lost my appetite I wouldn't have an appetite and I wouldn't feel like constantly hungry all the time but don't take this as like oh yeah let me lose weight and like take the CBD no because I actually gained weight this last past month so yeah I don't think it helps you gain weight I think it might slow down your metabolism or have some type of effects on your gastrointestinal things like that now would I recommend CBD or vaping CBD or using and buying any of these products I don't think I would only because it is so expensive for not having these Bruce the results that you want like okay so 600 mgs this you can find from like $40 to 90 like 40 to 90 right but like I said the 600 doesn't really affect you that much then once you go from 1000 and up it's pretty much a hundred dollars and up like so you're paying a lot of money for a little bit of juice that only lasts you a little while because like I said the effects last about like 30 minutes it's very short-term so the amount of money you're paying for you know a little bit of pain relief is it really worth it I don't know that is up to you and your pockets the only CBD medicine that is regulated by the FDA is epi dialects which is used to treat some cases of epilepsy but even those studies are inconclusive so yeah I feel like there's a whole big CBD epidemic going on right now and I would say girl it's not like worth it like use it like I don't think it's worth it I think I would personally hold off to buy more like CBD products and stuff like that until there are more studies done and more research you know I mean it's not regulated by a third party so it doesn't confirm how much you're actually getting you might be buying one thousand and it might just be five hundred you you don't really know that is my thoughts on vaping CBD that is my personal experience thank you guys so much for watching if you've ever tried CBD CBD Lotion CBD Baum CBD anything comment down below and let me know your experience thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time [Music]", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your own opinions bye", "YnpyI03qRZw": "hey guys so this is kind of like a this is a kind of a fun blog for me to do this week and it kind of happened by accident so about three or so weeks ago you might remember that I went to this crazy crazy spa convention with my friend Hillary who is the the informal skin Carmo CEO and we it was at the Javits Center in New York which is this massive like blocks long Convention Center and so this spa convention had you know a slew of spa focused brands like so nage which is one of my favorite what this is one of my favorite masks ever is antioxidant mass is incredible so so not so nage is an la-based Spa skincare brand they operate in the spa Channel and they have their own their own spa where they perform medical grade facials and things like that and so I ran into the founder the CEO of so nage at the convention and got a facial and you know I posted that on my IG and it was amazing so there were and there was also the foreo team was there and you know how much I love that foreo UFO mask matter of fact I think I need to do that this afternoon it's been a bit of men like a week um so there were brands there that I knew and brands that I kind of collab with and like loved and then there were brands that I'd never heard of before there was there a slew of like fake French spa brands like these brands like with products and services and stuff that sound French like because these crazy French names and they have nothing to do with brands so they're so there were like two ends of the spectrum right like really serious like spa brands at this spa convention they're never kind of these fake ones and then somehow like and then there were all these high-tech things like these LED facials like we're going on and people are laying down with the LED like bright deep red Warren G red LED lights you know similar to the dr. gross device so there was that going on but then there were like interspersed throughout this huge like it was an arena was like an underground chamber I don't it was nuts there are several maybe a dozen or so CBD and half of brands and I don't necessarily see how they really fit into the spa channel but this this this whole thing honestly it wasn't limited to spa right like you could present whatever if you have products you present and people who are looking for that in theirs I guess in their in their spas would be down for you know trying out your products and maybe presenting your products in in their businesses but um so the funny thing about a lot of these CBD brands is they're like they're kind of like wacky sometimes like what if that packaging like who came up with that packaging who designed that packaging like I'm a packaging copywriter I pay attention to packaging I pay attention to product names and how you know how things look do they look hokey do they look like you know they were made in someone's kitchen which is all well and good but that's like a different thing to me DIY skincare um or do they look like legit brands like thought like well-thought-out brands and I guess I'm like everybody if a if a package is is beautiful I tend to believe that what's inside is is is good for me it is delicious this stuff is delicious um that it's reliable you know packaging is everything like I just I love the drunk elephant package design I think it's incredible that's part of it right in you know sometimes packaging is more medicinal looking or pharmaceutical like the skin suitable so it's pretty straightforward and undesigned looking you know so it's got a little bit of the platinum going on but that's about it this is an excellent sunscreen by the way both of these both of these are but so the thing with the CBD market is is it's new and all these CBD brands are new and they're coming to market and they're not necessarily sophisticated I guess that's really what I'm getting at is the brand sophisticated does it feel like like it's solid and trustworthy or does it feel kind of hokey and you know like Wild West and so I was wandering around I spotted Hillary and I came across this one brand called Hempfield botanicals and within their their presentation in their in their area in their designated area I met the founder of him co-founder of Hempfield botanical her name is Heather she and her husband I think his name is nathan founded this brand in pennsylvania in and around Lancaster and so it's a CBD brand and they make several categories of products so they have topical treatments like their staff their CBD salve which which helps to alleviate pain so the the CBD in here is isolated and focused on pain relief and I'm going to talk about that in a second this product actually smells quite amazing and I'm gonna tell you how I used it which is a little wacky they have tinctures tinctures are ingestible drops that you either drop under your tonic tongue if they're an oil tank sure if they're a water-based tincture you can mix them with a beverage you can mix them with a protein shake you can drip them in your tea the the oral tinctures that Hempfield offers are all oil-based so you you drip these under your tongue and kind of hold them there for a bit and and and the CBD and the other components in the formula get infused into your into your system sorry that way and they also they also have a couple of skincare facial skin care treatments and one of these in particular so this one's called fortify and this one's called soothe and I am like completely infatuated with this product so you know usually when I'm testing a product like if I'm testing something in my nightly regimen what I want to do is use it sometimes every other night or so right so that I can see if there's a difference in the morning and how my skin reacts so I had been doing that since I got a bottle of this and I have come to realize that I love using it like I love the whole experience of this product it's it's I don't even know how to explain it like it smells amazing it's a blend so the soothe the soothe oral CBD oil is a blend of seven ingredients of five of which or is it four of which are non fragrant plant oils it just smells incredible non fragrant plant oils that we all know and love right now I have on my fingers and I'm not going to be able to scroll so it's got baroja seed oil it's got sunflower oil it's got hemp seed oil aka cannabis sativa seed oil and it's got chamomile and you know we know that chamomile is super soothing so those oils make it not unlike the the topical skincare oils that facial oils that I have reviewed recently though the one from Kiehl's I think it's called cannabis sativa seed concentrate the one from the one from Peter Thomas raw is baby here right so these are these are these are oils that are that that have cannabis sativa seed in the in the blend and so cannabis sativa seed helps to soothe skin but the difference between these the Kiehl's version the first aid beauty version is that this also contains something called crystalline cannabidiol so that's the that's the the CBD that's giving it it's kind of kind of it's kind of pushing it taking it up a notch from just straightforward facial oils and so what I have found on the day after the day after I use this is my skin is noticeably more calm I you know very often I have like parts of my face that experience irritation right up here and my forehead very commonly shows irritation so the the days that I the mornings after I use this product hands down it's quite obvious to me because I'm so in tune with how my skin looks and how my skin acts I have noticed that this product actually does soothe komm irritation and that's what it's intended to do so Hempfield claims that it calms a sensitive skin that it's an anti-inflammatory and that it's ideal for acne prone skin which is something that heals claims on their cannabis sativa seed concentrate so that but the thing about this so I only like in immersing myself in literature and research matter-of-fact Heather had given me a couple of pamphlets on CBD and on the products to take with me and I was like enthralled with them like who gets into educational pamphlets the people who write them so I I have been researching like what is it about these products that makes them kind of magical right or gives them a distinctiveness like when we talk about when we talk about these the oral tinctures you know this one's called headies and this one is called tunnel vision so this one is intended to help you focus obviously and heddes is to help alleviate headaches there's one called Forty Winks which helps you sleep so but what makes each of them different if they're using CBD and so what makes them different is something called terpenes and terpenoids of the in in this case of the cannabis plant there are apparently more than 100 isolates or terpenes in the cannabis plant and each of those has a distinct effect a specific benefit in the body so the terpenes in the tunnel vision have apparently the effect of helping you to focus and concentrate your mind and so I've been actually using this and I don't know do I notice well I noticed that I'm not like not concentrating but so but the the ones that I mean that's kind of like a big like a big benefit right are you more concentrate or less able to concentrate like if you can't concentrate something's going on anyway like you maybe have a lack of sleep so the but the Forty Winks is very obvious does it help you sleep better yes in fact it does and the I have a CBD supplement in pill form that I've been using kind of experimentally like let's see if this actually does work and you know you pop one of those at 15 milligrams 15 20 milligrams and depending on the concentration in your oil you you have to kind of figure out what's what's the right dosage so 15 15 to 20 milligrams dosage and obviously in a supplement form that's already taken care of and I'm like out like I'm in a coma I wake up in the morning and like Orpheus is blinking like what just happened um so if you have a concern for sleeping you know you have insomnia or you know anxiety keeps you up you really need to consider a form of CBD to help you to help you sleep it really does work in terms of anxiety if I'm having a particularly stressful day I have actually you know taken a little bit of the not the head ease but one of the one of the CBD concentrates that is just straight on terpene list I guess and it does really calm me down it's really incredible so I'm like excited to explore all of this stuff and I encourage you to do the same I have some links in the new blog companion to this video that can help help you with that research but my own personal research shows me that it's not BS in the least bit and if companies like Hempfield botanicals keep doing what they're doing and making like legit claims you know that are substantiated there are two form on on the Hempfield botanicals team so if the brand knows what it's doing and it knows how to how to communicate how to message what CBD does and what the individual within terpenes and the formulas are able to achieve then you know it look the products are all natural so like it's natural medicine and you know this this whole wave of you know THC and marijuana like medical marijuana that's legit like if you know anybody who experiences severe pain the medical marijuana takes care of that right it really does alleviate that and it's certainly more beneficial or less harmful than chemical substances like you know opioids so you know I should have started this out but it doesn't matter when I communicate this this is also in the blog so you know that we need to train our minds and how you do that is through education by reading and and you know being curious to understand that there's a difference between THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis and CBD which is non so like SoCo psychoactive so when I say psychoactive I'm talking about how marijuana or THC gets you high and so that particular component of the cannabis or hemp plant interacts with with receptors in your in your body in your brain I think it's called the cb1 receptor and that's what gets you high the THC interacts with the cb1 receptor somehow stimulates the cb1 receptor and that's not what CBD does cannabidiol is the other component of the cannabis plant right so you have THC and CBD and CBD doesn't react that way it doesn't interact with the body's um I think it's the endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid system so the body has this this system that's actually set up to interact believe it or not with cannabis of all crazy things like it sounds nuts but if you like dig deep and you like research it you like discover that it's like it's legit and that's why CBD and why components of the cannabis plant that include THC are able to alleviate anxiety and pain and able to help you sleep so it's this body's system and the receptors in the system that are interacting with the components of CBD to achieve those benefits in the body and it's all natural so that brings me to the one last product I want to talk about that Hempfield botanicals offers so we have the oral oils we have the the facial the facial oils that are topical skin care amazing product and then we have topical skincare that has medicinal benefits to it so like two weeks ago I would say and you might have noticed it like in like I noticed it in some of my videos I was like there's that that crazy redness on my wrist I started to realize that I was getting like a getting eczema like just really itchy dry skin irritated patchy like exactly what you think on my elbows and on my wrist and so I like I'm like what is going on like what is this I'd never had eczema before and it's like huh and I looked it up and I liked it like Google Images and sure it was like okay that's exactly what I have it looks exactly like that it feels it's a little bit edgy it's the same thing it's not like I don't have a like some crazy ass disease although I guess eczema is a disease right and so I went online and I ordered um I don't remember what the name of the product was but I ordered an XML lotion from Amazon and I knew even though was two-day shipping that I wasn't gonna get it for three days because it had the packages in my building it processed and everything takes a while unless you have an emergency and it wasn't an emergency so in the meantime like this particular area of redness and itchiness is like interacting with my watch band which was a nightmare because all day long I would feel it like oh god there it is and it was just a little a little crazy and disconcerting and I thought God what do I even have like in the interim to treat this while the lotion is coming and I remembered that that Hempfield had had given me this incredible salve like this mysterious salve which is loaded up with CBD and essential oils and let's see if I have it here somewhere so there's spearmint in here which means that it smells actually quite magnificent and so it's a it's a it's for pain it's for pain and inflammation right and so I thought to myself well at least it'll probably make the itching go away but truthfully I started applying this and the eczema like by the time that cream came three days later the eczema was barely noticeable and it was just a little bit of a red patch so even though that's kind of not what this product is formulated to do this is what I talked about this is what I mean when I talk about how like cmed has like all these incredible benefits that we are only barely just now understanding so this I'm like I'm not almost like get some sort of ache so every once in a while when I'm lifting weights I get a sprain in my arm and so I haven't been able to test this yet as a pain reliever but as an XML reliever and an itch reliever yeah this is this is it this ain't bad so anyway that's it guys just just do some exploring know that this is this is a it's a nascent market it's you know it's it's kind of cool it feels a little bit like the Wild West but you know when you really look at it and you look at you know legit brands like Hempfield botanicals there's their substance here it's it's real and it's kind of exciting and I'm this is like to me I'm gonna look back on this year 2019 was the year that CBD came into my life so anyway that's all have a good one be sure to check out my youtube page and subscribe please to my youtube channel and check out the blog at skin karma com where all of this diatribe is put into words and that's it have a good one you guys later", "sjITVewsEy4": "hi everyone its Meg Nordmann with household hemp your trusted source for all things CBD where I will be giving you reviews every week on a new product we've got about 30 products slated right now to start giving you reviews on and the first one I want to talk about is indica this is their wrong and boil it was the first oil that I tried and it's what started me down the rabbit hole of starting household him actually I loved it so much I had my first drop of CBD oil and my best sleep that it had in two and a half years and so I reached out to the company with my idea for household ham we made some great friends and they sent me some more products to try and first here's the robbing of oil and this is about just so that how much I personally take and I started off with even smaller amount than that and eventually increased and lock down my sweet spot and that's about how much I need four really great nicely it's my anxiety which we know all the moms need help with and then my second favorite thing which was probably tied as a first favorite if you have the money just getting both of them and you'll thank me is their South here and all of their ingredients are natural you can recognize them all it's the CBD coconut oil beeswax lemon oil citral vanilla and buy money nothing with red flags there you can see hopefully here you can see where I've just been dipping my finger into the same spot and I treat this thing like medicine for myself it is 750 milligrams and it is just an oily nough swen you rub it it's just an opening this on your finger my neck always has tension I don't wanna waste it and since it doesn't spread very far I mean the willingness just is like right where your finger rubs I just put it on the most acute spot and then what I like to do is pair it up there whipped body butter so this one has more it's very very faint lemon / vanilla ingredients and this one is a little bit more like cocoa and it spreads much easier as you can see I just got a whole dollop on mine and it's a little bit more firm if you keep it in the frigerator but it is literally 82 degrees in my house right now cuz i live in florida and i like to keep the windows open so anyway this I liked on top of whatever location I've put the South cuz it just spreads so much easier and so in about 20 minutes the tension in my neck is going to be gone I put this on joint pains muscle pains and it's been clinically proven CBD to be really great for skin and that's what they market face-forward is actually a foreskin and I have used it for my child's eczema my toddler had horrible eczema from four months old until two and a half years old but yeah so I put this out on the worst spots of her eczema and then rubbed body butter on top within 24 hours it was gone after spending probably hundreds of dollars on steroid creams and every kind of eczema cream you could imagine my friends made essential oil creams nothing really worked some things would like reduce the flare but not like what this DVD did it's completely gone so I have before and after pictures of that on my blog and household and the ingredients here very similar let's see shea butter palm oil cocoa seed butter the CBD coconut oil tapioca vanilla beeswax and find me again all very natural and trusted ingredients and then you've got the lip balm which is very similar ingredients to this almost identical and so it's really just that's in this convenient format you can drop it in your makeup bag oh here's a little fara she was tired of being alone in her Walker so yeah so talking about the lip balm here and with CBD being so amazing for your skin you can imagine you're just like it was just amazing how supple and soft your lips are after that the next thing is the chewing gum here let me open that up for you so let's see what that looks like paper and it's made with real gum like from the tree in the rainforest Chiclets gum from the rainforest xylitol from birch trees wild peppermint mint sunflower seeds and hemp oil so again all natural ingredients and everything is organic they they grow their own hemp on organic certified land their whole facility is organic certified I hope I'm saying that correctly and their third party lab tested and they have their certificates on their website call all the labs and actually talk to them about it and so I just this is one of the brands that I just trust the most and that's for the gum it is like what our grandparents probably chewed it's not like the kind of gum that you would pick up in fancy wild colors at the gas station or at the checkout line it is real gum so after about 20 to 30 minutes of chewing it it kind of starts to break down and just and spit that out if you try to take it out with your fingers it's gonna stick to your fingers again and that's not a bad thing I'm just setting up your expectations and because it is real gum and the reason for putting CBD and a gum is because of that bioavailability so you know I talked about putting this beneath your tongue because it's so thin on the sides of your cheeks and underneath your tongue the CBD can just soak right in and so this is just the gum while you're chewing I'm not gonna chew on one video that's gross but oh you're chewing that CBD is just in all of the right places and so it's just going to soak into you immediately and that would be a great way to get the effects that you're looking for the therapeutic effects as quick as possible so I've had a couple of very anxious days we're here I've never been very glad to have this sitting on my bookshelf yeah chewed my gum the last thing is the CBD crystals this is the one thing I have not actually tried yet I plan on doing a separate video I'm gonna try it because it's just pure CBD it's 99% CBD isolate a bit and show you this package here can't really reach with the baby in my arm looks like makeup it's very pretty packaging and if you could see in the bottom then it's like kind of like white salt anyway so anyway you can make anything with this and uni CBD thing that you want to make you make your own salad your own oil your own bombs you can just get really creative with that fine so excited about it I am planning on doing gummy bears I want to that makes me becoming bears at home so stay tuned for that video 5 stars Holocaust for this one everything has

system can stand in\nour way. Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs. I'll see you soon.", "SRaBge_9SUE": "hello good winter morning so last night it was so cold and I wake up and look at my hand how about try this so whenever it's winter time seeing you can see that my this one they hurt when it's cold let's see that so I don't take any more medication or I'm my medication is pain reliever but I don't take that so what I do is I use a alternative CBD okay so I got this it's a CBD plus by Chi Chi it says I'm gonna read it so I'm gonna turn it around okay it says 100 milligrams total CBD it's other less its colorless it's a topical cannot be dial so this small 2 has 100 milligrams of CBD it's 8 ounces ok so I'm gonna read the back so we have an idea directions for use apply to the affected areas and Rob in use as needed throughout the day so there's no limit unlike other pointment they can only use them like wands or I mean twice are the four times because you get burned and you know what once you apply it too much in the day your skin will get burned so that's why I like this because you can use this any time of the day no limit it says that this lotion uses a purified CBD extract that contains no no THC it contains more than four milligrams of CVD per milliliter or milligrams I keep out of reach of children and pets do not take internally so I'm quite confused about that for me the graphs of CVD per mil millon oh ok I got it it's 8 ounces 23 milligram times 4 do the math maybe they run it off to 100 milligram okay yeah I mean I I can't I can't the CBD content how many milligrams that's what I do now so let's see let's open it so I'm gonna put it on top of my knuckle so it's white rabbit I hope you could see what I mean there you go you had her sight so I don't wanna waste I don't wanna waste of those you know put it on my tongue either you're on seeing so this is what I do the reason why I like this is because when you use a bomb I like bombs okay I like bombs but when I go to work I use this because I type I type in the computer I'm a web developer so like 810 hours a day I'm typing and when you use a bomb it's sticky it sticks in the keyboard so this one is good so as you can see put a focus there you go there's no stickiness there's no shyness you know I mean you can see the reflection of light but it's not as shiny so it's not sticky at all it's not sticky no smell I mean there's the subtle smell like a powder or a low short sorry it's a little lotion but very very small hint so if you don't like the smell of liniment or tiger balm or either one your coworker or someone you know that's you know you think will get offended when they when they smell that strong smell you can use this there you go well I'm not trying to show you my arthritis I'm trying to show the the lotions so as you can see there is no it's not sticky and it's odorless and colorless so uh does it work yes it does work that's why I like it and you know over the course of years I really tried several augment for my hand and my back and my lower back and this one works for me but let me tell you something this works the first application but when I'm using it for example the second time for example I'm gonna put another I'm gonna apply again after four hours it's not as effective as the first application but it does the work it really does so I recommend it I like this product it's I like it because it's odorless it's odorless and it's colorless and it works it does work if you liked it please subscribe because I wanna make more reviews of CVD products and I really need your help subscribe please thank you happy CVD Abbey

this will take a while [Music] [Music] okay guys so this is just a fYI tip if you are making anything that has water in it you need to use a preservative if you do not use a preservative it can only last up to seven days in the refrigerator I'm as late as one with them if you do a DIY and you do not use the preservative it will only last up to seven days in the refrigerator so I was on a couple of websites a couple of blogs and I really didn't understand the 1% or the 2% amount I was like really really confused so somebody else was like check out Bree hauls video she explains it perfectly check out her video it will be linked below but I did take a screenshot and I'm gonna explain it to you guys as well but definitely check out her video so the first thing you're gonna do before you even get started is you're going to measure your mixing bowl empty I use ounces but use whatever system you use alright so after everything is mixed you are going to weigh that you are going to subtract the mixture in the bowl from the weight of the empty bowl all right that's going to give you the amount of product you are going to take the amount of product and multiply that by 0.01% and then that is going to tell you how much preservative you need to add oh my gosh it's that easy but all the websites that I went to that was that hat like a preservative calculator I just couldn't get it I couldn't understand it and she explained it so perfectly I'm a flash it up on the screen so definitely shout out to her and she said that she'll be posting a lot more videos about preservatives and stuff like that so definitely check out her channel and thank you guys for watching if you have any more questions let me know in the comments below and if you're gonna try this body butter let me

"Y_BhO6es4jo": "hi guys and thanks again so much for clicking on this video if you like the topic of this video could you please remember to give me a thumbs up but if you completed this video and was happy with it please also remember to give me a thumbs up so in this video I'm going to be talking about cannabis oil but CBD oil and CBD oil so kind of is oil is known to be illegal but I am going to be reviewing a substance that comes from cannabis oil which is legal so you know cannabis oil is known for making people feel so this is a form of the cannabis plant is extracted from the cannabis plant but they haven't extracted the form that makes you feel high or they have and they've removed it from the CBD oil which is why it is legal so I am going to be talking about the love CBD oil brand and it's a Dutch friend and it states that cannabis food supplement which is in 300 mg it's a CBD and CBD oil so CBD oil is known for helping manage anxiety depression insomnia social anxiety pain relief it's really good if you have arthritis and what the CBD oil does it helps with hormones in your body it helps with hormone regulation and our brains produce something called serotonin which is like a happy hormone in our brain and the CBD oil is known to help that feeling or hormone last a lot longer you know that hormone is usually there with me feel happy and giddy and confident and everything just going well and our bodies just intertwine with each other our organs intertwine you know everything's just blowing amazing but you know our bodies are known for kind of feeling down and drowsy and sometimes they do for like that and we just don't know why sometimes you know sometimes nothing's wrong but we just feel down but it could be down to so much factors like food well we eat the pollution free radicals sub conscious or subconscious mind anything so CBD oil is really good for some of those things as I said insomnia if you have trouble sleeping if you have trouble being in crowds in places of lots of people you know CBD are definitely really good for you another thing that is good I was using ashwagandha reishi they're really good for depression and anxiety and just help it relax your muscles but there is some more I'm loving the CBD oil and the reason why I purchased it is because it's so super easy and there's so much things about CBD oil that we do not know so apparently the CBD oil steli la plante structure is very similar to our body's structure to our to the genetic we know that the body makes up so if you look at a human cell under a microscope apparently it looks very similar to the cannabis plant that's why when we take CBD oil it it helps it works with our body so well because the cellular structure of it is so similarly i dint achill to our bodies it's amazing so that's I think that's one of the reasons why it works with our bodies so so well so this one that I have purchased is 300 mg as I said it had kind of this extract and olive oil if it just had the full kind of extract it would be way too strong so they need to had a carrier oil with this which they added a little bit of olive oil it says shake well before use which I do it's 2299 for 300 mg and 20 mil which i think is okay so if you is going to purchase 1000 mg it would cost you about 50 something pounds so that's the kind of price range well if you know so I'm going to tell you about the dosage those are the dosage it says take one spray day me for free days if needed slow we build up to a maximum of free sprays taken three times a day so if I take this three sprays one time a day remember for the first few days you take one spray three times a day sorry that would give me three six nine nine hundred mg for the whole day but it says after the three days you can take a maximum of three sprays three times a day that will give me a maximum of 2,700 mg for that day 2,700 mg for that day so if you purchase one that is a maximum of 300 mg you probably will be instructed to not take as much so if you've purchased 1000 mg you're probably instructed to take this once a day maybe free sprays once a day or maybe twice a day maybe one spray a day so don't always think you need to get a higher mg don't always feel like you have to get a higher dosage of something because if this was a lower dosage I'm sure it will tell you to take less so as I said it cost me 20 299 and I've only taken one spray three times a day and I've noticed a complete difference my sleep has been amazing I haven't woke up in the middle of the night I feel so much more relaxed my muscles feel so much more relaxed I feel like I can speak better I feel confident I feel amazing so that that's how I'm gonna put it cuz that's how I feel that's how it's made me feel and I've noticed how I was feeling before taking this CBD oil and I've noticed how I feel after taking the CBD oil and I have noticed a significant difference so I definitely would recommend this another reason why I recommend this because it comes in a spray form like my vitamin D spray which it's just so like when you're out when you're on the move when you're on the go when you're busy when you have things to do you don't have time to get a cup of water and a tablet and open the tablet and drink it down like we don't have time for that and on top of that you don't really want people knowing your business like what you're taking my on what are you taking I'm taking so what so and so and so okay I want to take that too and the person doesn't even know anything about it they don't know if it's good for you for them you know so definitely I think it's great because you can just open it spreading your tongue and you're off another thing is you don't need to take these things with food usually when you take the sprays they absorb right into the glands and they get into the bloodstream so much easier you don't have to take it as a tablet your body doesn't have to break it down it's not being exposed to acids that are used to break down the food it's so convenient they're a bit more pricey I take it sprays but they're definitely worth it and I definitely would recommend CBD oil because I'm only been using it for about four days now and I've noticed a significant difference like my sleep is so much better I feel less anxiety I feel less social anxiety I didn't I wasn't feeling like depressed or anything anyway but I just have like a happy hormone where I'm just like I feel amazing I feel amazing I feel amazing so I definitely would have recommend this so yeah it's by the brand love CBD it's a Dutch band and we just say how long I've been talking it's a Dutch brand and it's a form of cannabis it comes from the cannabis plant but they have extracted the substance that makes you feel high as I said so it is legal you know you can put this I purchased this in my local house store so it's fine it's safe and it comes in a lot of different forms you can get in a bomb like for pain relief and the bomb I was going to get for like period pains but I may get that in the near future so I'm really really loving the CBD oil you know it's great it's been working well for me and it's worked so fast and so quickly and I think one of the reasons why it's because it's got into my bloodstream a lot quicker because it's a spray foam and I just think it's really really good and I think I told you you get 20 mil and because you just I'm gonna use like free time today I think this is gonna last forever I'm really loving this CBD oil I'm definitely gonna put the information in the description below and as I said it's good for anxiety it's good for depression it's good for cardiovascular health it's good for it's also good for acne apparently just do some research but apparently like a load of people said that they use CBD oil for their skin and for the acne and it like helped them and it cleared it up and not just from the outside from the inside and I know you can use CBD oil on your skin this one doesn't really say you can use on your skin but if you can take the internally you can use on your skin it is quite strong I mean it's strong because I have had hemp oil before which is another form of the kind of is plant and I use the hemp oil for kicking and spitting on my salads and it does it does very much taste like hemp oil but it has a stronger taste it's a bit more potent and it has a burning kind of sensation but that's the way to know that is CBD oil it's a lot stronger and you feel that burning sensation I think that's amazing because you can tell that it differentiates from hemp oil and you can tell that it contains CBD and CBD oil and I thought the difference already and well you know yeah and I knew I would for the difference but maybe not so quick but I felt the difference so this is definitely amazing if you're suffering from any kind of social site or anything I definitely would recommend this so it helps our bodies just be back in tune with itself it helps our organs to be in tune it helps relax awesome when our body and our muscles are relaxed so much things are less noticeable like that on the unimportant things and our bodies are a lot more relaxed we feel much more confident and we feel amazing we can get on with my life so much better we can do more we can manifest better so I definitely would recommend this CBD oil so that completes my video guys thanks again so much for watching if you want any more information about my CBD oil I'll put it in the link below well not the mick below I put it in the description below but if you want any more information just remember to comment and I'll all be always be there to reply thanks again for watching this video please remember to keep your

let's just I'm gonna live at it [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] get", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

milligrams of hemp extract benefits galore every single it's almost like it can fix anything and everything that's wrong with you jumo when it comes to hemp yes we've heard that it can fix many things it's a natural substance we've heard that it can fix so many things what are those things I think the beauty about it is we talking about the premium hemp extracts and lovely we're talking about hemp and we're talking about the CBD oil component so when we talking about the CBD I know some people have you know they're thinking about the psychoactive X you know properties then come from THC so this does not have THC so that's the beauty about here so we're talking about a product that is very good in terms of dealing with inflammation so it's an anti it has got anti-inflammatory properties most condition science now knows that inflammation chronic inflammation check spot so now when you control chronic inflammation you are now in a position like you said to control main country many conditions now look at pain yes with most people if you put rheumatoid arthritis pain is one of those things and CBD oil would do just good in making sure that it can help with the pain killing effect look at people who are on antidepressants people in fact if you look at your statistics in fact I'm going to give the right figures so that next time we can actually give the viewers the statistics of how many housewives and now on antidepressants if we talk about South Africa in particular that's a huge number because you see you can find out there is lots of stress there's lots of things that we need to handle so let's now intend to natural alternatives that will help you calm you down deal with the depression deal with the stress make sure that your mind or the brain is well looked after without any side effects this is what we are offering I mean you you hit it on the nail again do more in terms of the high rate of depression the high rate of stresses our lifestyles have become so toxic now but people are starting slowly but surely moving to more natural elements from natural reliefs they're looking towards eating healthiest it from the roots straight from the trees they no longer getting these artificial types foods because they realize that the body can't handle something that is foreign to it but if it's natural from the ground itself it means that it's highly beneficial for your body what the hemp extract over here that we have the premium hemp extract 300 milligrams we are saying 520 Rand is an investment to long health for benefits of peace of mind longevity in terms of how you are thinking and your brainpower reducing that anxiety 520 Rand is all you need to pay call us on our weight 6:1 triple zero 173 or go to WWE motor Co today and ask for the premium hemp extract 300 milligrams it's so important that we delve in delve into the whole CBD yeah elevator things the beauty about it is wise people get confused and we here to make sure that we make you understand this is the 300 milligram strength that we're talking about so what it means is their whole bottle of 30 mils has got 300 milligrams Wow that's what we are looking at so if we look at it a drop you know a milliliter contains about 20 drops so when you look at 30 mils you are looking at about 600 drops that you get from there so when you look at the 300 milligrams every true drops will probably give review a milligram of their CBD so you're not taking because people wonder is that not too much 300 milligrams yeah you're not taking the whole bottle if you take the whole bottle you're going to consume 300 milligrams yeah that's what it means when you're looking at CBD UI and most people get confused so we just want to clarify it to you know that for you viewers so that you understand you're going to take a few drops at a time and the good thing is you can start by two to five drops and then you can you can take it once or twice a day and then you know when you look at that then you can now enjoy the benefits I mean this is just these are some of the features that we're talking about if you look at me we relief of pain yes pain slows you down no one wants to be in pain and this is a nice way of making sure that you've got a natural painkiller and at times I get asked when people ask about CBD if I've got arthritis and I take a CBD or what if I stop then I answer in a response you are on some medication when you use that medication if it's helping you as a pay-for pain relieving when you stop taking it doesn't the pain come back so we are not selling something that is magical we're selling something that is natural that is true that will give you the good effects without the side effects that most drugs would give you absolutely and this means that for a longer period of time I will be healed it's not a temporary fix I like what you've just brought in because you see viewers what whatever is just trying to you know to make Kajal new too is the fact that when you are using CBD on you are now increasing your natural chances of self healing the body self hills so when you are taking the right amounts and that's why you find that because we've got different sensitivities to any you know a drug or medicine medication that you can give us you will have to titrate upwards start with two drops three drops go to five drops until you get to that right dosage that is suitable for your condition to get rid of that pain to get rid you know to tackle that anxiety but once you are doing that you are creating a natural environment that makes it easy for the body to self heal which is what most you know when you look at from a surgical drugs they don't do that they just cover the pain aspects but not create an environment for the self healing for the body that's the beauty about using natural product that that is that is very beautiful what you just said cuz honestly what your mo is basically alluding to is the fact that there are so many pharmaceutical products that deal with the surface which is the painless they effect but the deep down the root and the element and the substance of wait actually begins it means that it's susceptible to come back if you stop using autism so with the with the natural extract over here the hemp premium extractor 300 milligrams if you have been looking for a solution for your pain you have been suffering from arthritis you've been in pain for a long time you're suffering from depression or you have anxiety you are constantly under anxiety anxiety spells and you just don't know how to stop it you've tried the conventional way of doing it it was either too expensive or only well temporarily and it just stopped working we have a solution for you here CBD 300 milligrams and this is an attachment and I think for that reason this is the reason why when you look at our table then now now you've been using the 300 milligrams and you are say using twenty ten drops 20 drops at yes and you realize okay this is what you need so now so that we you don't feel like you are taking too much now you can now step up and now invest in a six hundred milligram and still keep those number of drops that you were taking in five drops to you know just keep it down don't take don't feel like you're taking too much so now you can handle the 300 milligram that's why now we also we also offer the 600 milligram that way now you can now have you can use less to get the same effect that's why the 300 the 600 milligram is also available and legs you can see the six hundred milligram it means that in your sixty drops you've got 600 milligrams of the CBD so that's in the whole a sip in the whole bottle that's what we are offering and that's quite a substantial amount to help to actually bring forth those benefits that you mo was talking about so if you are looking for a complementary element to your to your health so basically an extract that helps you get your body to its optimal

know hormones that really tend to bother us most of the time in a natural way and of course you try to titrate yourself upwards in terms of the dosage until you get it right so just like any medication I mean even is you know more for masataka medication you can get a 5 milligram a 10 milligram and a 20 milligram and as you can then get to that right point for you and because we are different in science and we are also different you know that we've got males and females also respond to dosages differently so but you can wake your way up and you know we can always help you you can always phone in to make sure that you get it right so is we can this is the six hundred milligram and you can take a few drops under the tongue is the best okay also was we have there what would be very important to take note of this some people have tried some CBD oil out there and they said it does not work it's about the quality we offer a new quality and also we've remembered with God with the signs you need to have the CBD carried in an oil form so this is an oil best to make sure that it's protected when you take it in and then you can absorb it and get the maximum benefits of the CBD so this is quality when you're buying CBD you want to get the quality one you want to make sure that it's in an oil-based form so that it can be carried nicely and get the maximum benefits that you

lotion review what is going on my well Lisi peeps my name is Eden and I am the owner of Wella c-calm see one of our past review videos welcome back if this is your first review video well welcome I'm super excited to have you make sure you click the subscribe button below so you never miss out on the release of any of our new educational CBD content or product reviews so today I am super thrilled to be reviewing the new Pachamama CBD body lotion which contains 300 milligrams of THC free broad-spectrum hemp extract so I wanted to let you guys know what type of hemp extract was used and at the very beginning of this review video because you know if you can't use THC or you know you don't want to you know your drug test or whatever reason then you need to avoid full-spectrum CBD products so you still have broad spectrum or CBD isolate products which luckily for you the Pachamama CBD body lotion has 300 milligrams of broad-spectrum hemp extract all right so let's kind of sort of walk through the the Pachamama CBD body lotion so of course THC free it comes in a nice 1.7 ounce bottle it's a nice little hefty little bottle on it's lit pretty small I mean great for your backpack your purse you can keep it you know at your desk at work or you know on your nightstand I mean putting in your pocket you could but I mean it would be a little bulky for that but I mean it's it's a very solid size you know comes in this nice little air pump bottle very phenomenal so with the Pachamama CBD body lotion you know you can give your body and your skin the revitalizing boost that it needs you know the Pachamama cvd body lotions helps your skin to naturally hold moisture and repel toxins out so you know it can help to the the CBD Pachamama CBD body lotion is designed for you know the moisturization type effects if you're looking for that and also to restore the natural health and look and feel of your skin you know as Pachamama says right on the box the Pachamama CBD body lotion is a stress relief moisturizer because the broad spectrum CBD is not the only thing that's in this incredible formulation you know some of the other ingredients include you know comforting aloe you know great for skin health really great for you know even sunburned so you know summer is coming up so that would be great there's a Primos oil there is rejuvenating rubios or Robo sorry excuse me please correct me if I mispronounced that word in the comment section below I like when you guys call me out and then there is calming lavender you know lavender is a very widely used sort of aroma in aromatherapy for example or you know essential oils just because of its relaxing effects I mean we even at wellis we have a relaxing lavender CBD bath balm so you know lavender is just ideal for you know inducing those stress relief the relief aspects while also helping with combined with the other ingredients in the CBD body lotion the moisturization aspects that you are looking for so you know this CBD body lotion is great you know helps you relax could it potentially help you relax and while also helping to moisturize your skin potentially you know with all CBD products we cannot make any medical claims it is 100% against the law to do that I am NOT I want you guys to know that if I am NOT saying that any of facts that you could if I potentially experienced the effects that is no way me guaranteeing that you will experience those similar effects or even any effects for that matter so if you ever encounter a CBD company that is trying to sell you a CBD product by making unsubstantiated and medical claims they are breaking the law and they are obviously trying to hide something that's lacking in their formulation so do not and I repeat do not buy CBD products from a company making unsubstantiated medical claims all right and please make sure you always buy a CBD product that is third-party lab tested that brings me the next point of the Pachamama CBD body lotion right here on the box there is a QR code that you can easily scan and it'll take you to a verifiable third-party test results so you can confirm that one there's no THC and there is of course at least 300 milligrams of CBD and since it's a broad spectrum you should be looking for other minor cannabinoids you know like the CBC's the cbn the CB g's and so on and so forth there's many many other minor cannabinoids CBD and THC just get all of the attention alright so let's jump right in and review this 300 milligram THC free broad-spectrum CBD extract that is actually infused with soothing oils to rejuvenate your skin by regenerating healthy tissues and cells it plus guys the aromatic properties of the lavender tea tree robos and geranium offer additional relaxation of benef benefits you know including potential stress-related potential stress relief effects in addition to those relaxation benefits so I mean I look at this Pachamama CBD body lotion and I'm just like yo this just looks like moisturization and relaxation in a bottle so let's go ahead and jump right in and give the Pachamama CBD body lotion ago so it comes with this nice little cover you know or stopper I guess you could say right here you could you know take it out and discard it or you could honestly just use it use it use the lotion and put it back in just so you know no excess really runs out so oh I smell that lavender that lavender and mmm the tea tree and the robust or rooibos rooibos Wow and geranium in there and definitely I mean that lavender that tea tree oil is what I'm definitely smelling so so come to this nice little air pump bottle so you go like this and then Shh and then you just put it on and if you guys look it looks like any other lotion I mean honestly it is it kind of has like a little yellowish kind of tint to it but that's from the hemp extract honestly so and you know you guys can shake it up do that and oh I just feel relaxed smelling that I mean just based off this scent I mean I'm the set profile just off of this I'm gonna put it right at a 9 in it and then 910 on the scent scale so once I use it and apply to my body I'll come back and touch on that it's to see if it matches you know we'll see but I'm so play it here and what's your edge punch Obama says you know the body lotion is formulated with calming and soothing oils and herbs to protect the skin natural lipid barrier that holds moisture and it repels the toxins and you know for usage you apply generously to the skin throughout the day allow for complete absorption makes you really rub that bad boy in and repeat as needed you know you can use this multiple times per day it's not something you just have to use once you can use it as needed so let's give it a go so mix it up and just on my hands it just looks like any other lotion and I actually got some out here in Colorado you know it's really really dry and you know the change from the cold weather like three days ago I was 70 degrees and then yesterday it was snowing so just dry skin over here in Colorado and Wow so I'm just gonna as you guys see I'm literally like rubbing this all on both of my arms and kinda just feels like right now like I kind of sort of like feel like I get this is a lot of topicals honestly like I always say it's a I could feel the CBD stimulating my I can have annoyed receptors on my on my skin but I mean you know that's just me kind of being funny but it really does kind of feel that like I kind of just get a tingling sort of sensation it's kind of mild you know but I do feel it and then yeah this scent is phenomenal you know I'm still gonna leave it at that 9:00 at a 10 on the cent scale for sure like this is one of my favorite smell smelling topicals that I've ever come across like poncho mami you guys killed it you know that lavender that lavender and they're the tea tree the rooibos I think it's rooibos is how you say it and geranium like well like I can see why this this would have the potential you know to induce those sort of stress relief and relaxation benefits potentially that you could experience because I do just that scent just provided a sense of calmness and relaxation over over my whole body and like the more tan of course you know let's touch on the moisturization benefit my skin is incredibly soft you know I mean I just put this on and like you know the dryness of moist scratching and stuff you guys might be able to see my neck kind it might be a little red so I'll put a little bit on my neck but so I'm like itchy and scratching and like I I don't I just have like a sudden urges cuz he's dry did you scratch it and like I don't feel that urge right after applying this lotion so I mean you know the moisturization like it'll go into effect like that you know and it oh man that smells very very good and you know it's uh you can take the so you can use it multiple times throughout the day but you know it's important to realize that with CBD topicals you know of course you know it can start stimulating your endo cannabinoid receptors on your skin and start improving the health you know and combating you know depending on the topical like the last review video was the Pachamama CD pain cream you know right you could feel it start to really go to work pretty quickly you know rather quickly I would say it's nothing like ours like a capsule or an edible but what I will say is that with CVD topicals and with all CVD products for that matter yes there are people you may be one of those people that experience relief after that your first use whereas most people it can take two weeks and sometimes even up to a month or maybe a little bit longer of consistent regular usage for you to start to experience noticeable improvement or even effects in all or you know you may just not experience them any at all you know so there's no guarantees with CVD products there's all there's a ton of preliminary information preliminary studies but we really need further information before definitive answers can be provided or definitive results can be said when it comes to these CBD products so you need to use it on a regular basis consistently I mean the CBD Body Lotion sits like it for the moisturization I mean I felt that pretty quick you know my skin feels really good I don't have even seen on camera but like it just like looks really shiny and it just like my skin just looks really healthy and it feels really healthy and what's great about the body less you know you just rub it on and then your hands I mean it's a it's just like it's like when you put any other lost shiny kind of that little grease eNOS it's not horrible like I could still grab stuff and write but you can still kind of feel the grease eNOS but what's great about topicals is you just rub it on and then you know if you have dry skin on your hands like I do then it just benefited you in regards to that so I mean I'm still gonna give it a 9 a 10 on the cent scale so and also guys if you check the description section below you will find an exclusive coupon code that you can use to save 15% off your first purchase of the Pachamama CBD body lotion so make

we've been working with primal for a while now a long time now it has been a long time and we're we feel so privileged to to be here and have pro-life here because our aim pro life's story if you like and what a more goal is to be the best provider of CBD oils and in sounds that were going to talk about later as well in world so we started this company we'll talk about this later but we set up the company quite a long time ago due to some personal issues that rule which we'll go into but we source the best CBD available in the world as far as we are concerned and from start to finish yes and that's what we bring to you today and it's so lovely it's so lovely to have cherry here in the studio as well to answer questions I'm going to be asking lots of questions that you may have at home you may know lots about there and the C video or you may know a little bit but we're really going to be exploring your mania may know nothing about it at all but first of all I've talked about the offers we have today okay so let's just talk through the oils now just be very clear these are oils you ingest these are oils you take will explain the quantities to stress the everything about this so there are three on off the today as well as the South okay so we'll talk again I'm just done so these are all the first way is 10 millimeter ten millimeter sized okay which is 3 that's the 8% the scale 8% in strength another 10 millimeters as well which is 20% and then we've got the bigger volume here as in quantity 300 million 400 milliliters and that sits in between a 10 percent yes okay and of course we've got the self as well where you can read target parts of the body as well yeah okay lots of questions to be home and what I love talking to you cherry because you're so passionate about this this comes off you're a real ambassador for for the oils there's not actually one question you don't know the answer to yeah and it's always fueled with such passion and I've got you know take us on a few journeys as well personal stories and how yeah but let's start right at the beginning yeah what is CBD good question really isn't it it's something that so many of us heard of now and so many people do know about it but also there are people new new customers all the time and so CBD stands for cannabidiol you will hear it pronounced differently especially by the Americans pronunciations but what did it puts as simply as I possibly can put it it is a compound okay so you will hear me talk about and you'll hear other people refer to cannabinoids yeah and this is from the hemp plant so the hemp plant is made up of over a hundred different cannabinoids cannabinoid just means compound right so CBD itself is the most important compound from the hemp plant as simply as I can yeah that's it okay and that is what we're focusing on it'sit's the compound that has the most health benefits that's proving to help people the most through so much research that's going on right now our oils do have other compounds in as well which we can touch on later yeah sure but CBD itself is is what everybody is talking about what everybody wants and it really is proving to be magical really just extreme will come on to how how it's been known to help her along the way but just just really signpost the quality of this pro life it really is different than what I've seen out there again we'll come to this yeah I'm always interested when we have where we have guests on and meet people like yourself cherry is how quite often there's a personal story or a narrative did CBD find you or did you find it and if you don't mind explain how yeah absolutely and Toby made many of you will have seen Toby here because he's done more shows yes and actually he's a here's the reason why we are here today unfortunately Toby last year was diagnosed with cancer okay he's only 30 in fact it was just before 30th birthday and of course that's devastation as it would be for anybody yeah and I'd already heard of CBD because of my own conditions I have epilepsy and diabetes and was told to take it and as I'm sure most people feel I don't know enough about it I didn't look into it enough I trust medicine medicine saved my life I think it's amazing but with cancer Toby having cancer it did find us in a way CBD did find us because we wanted an alternative option of course we were going to do everything possible for Toby in the medic going down the medical route but what if what more can we do to help him and so I thought let's give CBD ago what's the what's the harm it's been known to help reduce tumors it's been known to help with nausea yeah so I saw stem CBD or we sourced it together at the time and actually cutting a long story short we were sold something that wasn't what it said it was on Anton okay and now of course that fills you with doubt and mistrust and I thought well we've just spent a lot of money on something that actually isn't helping him it was that I think it was labeled as 20% in it and we found out it was 2% so you went through the tests to find out yeah yeah because it just we weren't seeing the effect and anyway long story short we ended up going to a company in America yeah that's how long it took us some trialing CBDs in the UK we ended up in America with a fantastic company who they set up because a little girl over there she was having 300 seizures a week and they also needed an option an alternative option because no medication was helping I had epilepsy they set at the CBD company and it's she's now seizure free which blows my mind it's absolutely amazing and of course I thought that works that's amazing oil we need it yeah and as we've we then bought it for what it over for Toby and it wasn't really until a friends and family said why don't you do this is it there is obviously a huge gap in the UK market for for this amazing oil there's lots available you will see it being sold in many many stores yeah but the quality wasn't there not that we could find not that we wanted for a serious condition like cancer yeah and so that's how it was born because our friends and family said why you I mean this is going to help people why don't you why don't you yeah offer it to the world it's not going to DJ I feel this from you and Toby there's an incredible passion I feel and with your pioneer is in many way that the purpose of what you're doing here was a driven from a passion of getting a quality getting the quality product to the people who yeah absolutely it's honestly it's it's strange to sit here and almost talk about it like it's a business because it was a personal help to our family it was just a it was to help to try and improve my brother's health yes to then change into a business and help other people has been amazing it's been one of the most incredible journeys and the feedback we've been getting and we've been getting from here at Prime yeah and that's where the passion comes from because the the feeling every single day yeah that you are helping people improve their lives is one of the best things in the world yes just unbelievable and also we didn't know at the time where the Toby would be how poorly he'd be he would be yeah he travels a lot for work he goes on television we didn't have to do this hair we didn't all these things and we thought you know what this gives him a project it's helping his health let's help other people and we are hugely passionate about it comes across and it comes across in the products well in the oils as well and here at primer living we love learning you are love learning as well we again it's always feel if you if we if we learn empowers as we can make more informed decisions and with the pro life it seems a very same sort of ethos as well about in getting that that knowledge absolutely and we learn all the time as well we're always learning right now as I say the I've just first of all and I just talk about what it can help with or how it's helped people yeah exactly but but just before then is this legal absolutely legal yes you can there's been a lot of debate around see we do yours but it is 100% legal in almost every country now now there are a couple of countries around the world that are yet to change their their laws but is in terms of you buying at home and taking in the UK it is 100% legal there is nothing about our oils that are okay we're really going to explore the ingredients and what's in these fabulous bottles along the way as well now what can now we've had who you've had to help me out as well as what can if I'm actually it's a very loaded question the big question what pan CBD helped with so I printed this off in it because yes it's never ending list almost do you know what this isn't even this doesn't touch the sides right because the list is ridiculous so let me just read for you and Finnick yeah just some of the conditions and this is this policy go online and have a look for yourself because this is just a tenth I mean there isn't anything yet that someone's come to me with where it hasn't I haven't been able to find a way that CBD would help so Justin lists a few addiction they go there on the screen for you as well ADHD Alzheimer's anorexia anxiety anxiety huge arthritis also huge heart disease glue coma depression diabetes my experience with diabetes is amazing epilepsy liver disease kidney disease nausea OCD are super Isis Parkinson's PTSD skin condition sleep disorders stress and stress this huge as well it helps people in stroke recovery anyone with bipolar disorders migraines moods yes I could honestly we could do extraordinary yeah yeah I mean I mean what were your thoughts and feelings here with this one and what I don't know what here at Brown living we have and we want the whole our show which is great but I know sometimes when you got people for five minutes or ten days people dip in and dip out so really championing and signposting the quality of these particular oils that we see I've seen CVD elsewhere for example yeah quality of these prolong it's it's everything I must say it's this is this is where it always boils back to why we are here yeah the reason why we didn't end up with an oil from the UK the reason why I love a soft little question then why are we here talking about this what is in these bottles is in our bodies anyway so cannabinoids all these compounds that you get within these bottles have always been within our body we produce them naturally but that's a whole that's a whole different thing we'll talk about that in a second but no but why pro life exists yeah is it's because it was for our health so we are not messing around on quality we don't try and cook any corners we aren't trying to produce it faster we aren't trying to produce it cheaper because to drop any of our quality standards in the process of the plant to getting it into that bottle yeah it just wouldn't it just wouldn't fit what we're trying to do I think one's across I mean I've been since I was doing this show with you I have research research research and there's all kinds of other extraction procedure which will go into yeah and they're in in a little while with any kind of when we here on probably living with any kind of the vitamins a bit minerals or someone's always have those two questions how where why which and how so how does this work give it a go alright this is a big one this and this will if you haven't heard about this before will fascinate you in terms of in terms of how it works yeah you need to try it then I'm not for yeah absolutely okay so this still today I have talked about CBD for I don't know how many days and hours of my life and it still blows my mind that this is that this works in in the way that it does okay so you get pipette yeah so let me first of all tell you about the endocannabinoid system yes that's everything we have a system in our bodies that they only discovered 30 years ago and you've got basically if Elliot could show us the picture there it is so you've gotta talk us through talk us through that is there you see all those green dots they are receptors uh-huh and that is what your endocannabinoid system is so it's receptors all throughout the body and what they control everything Wow mood appetite stress and anything that send you a body out of balance yeah yeah the endocannabinoid system is there to bring you back to homeostasis which is a word you will hear a lot here at primal a word that you will hear a lot associated with CBD the whole point of this system and there was an article the other day that actually said it is the most important system you've never heard of so should I take - no and you can't explain what if Nick takes them and then I can explain what is happening immediately and this is what's so so unbelievable about CBD yeah so you juice you produce this anyway okay yep so can we have cannabinoids that we produce within our body that naturally happens an endocannabinoid system works very nicely yeah until we become deficient which I'll talk about in a second okay and then you now are about to top up your cannabinoids wonderful okay so good in the bottle you get your pipette yes okay now what I would recommend we'll talk about doses and strengths later on yeah what I would recommend for you now if you just have like a third zapper pet yeah directly under your tongue why under the tongue because it will absorb into your bloodstream okay so the reason we don't do capsules the reason that we focus on oil rather than capsules is because it goes directly in your bloodstream and you don't if you had it at the capsule you would lose the absorption of course okay so under the tongue and you'll have to keep it there for 90 seconds please 96 yeah right okay so okay so how many do tell me cops recommend the my I would say just just for now let's plane drops ace about a third of the pipette I would do just under or just down okay so under your tongue okay so nips now taking it under his tongue in a very glamorous way and if we go back to the endocannabinoid system I'll tell you what's happening so then you don't have to look at Nick just [Laughter] this right now in Nick's body imagine that's Nick on screen now all of these kind of receptors are there what the CBD is doing now is going to the receptors that need it the most so you might I don't know people take it for migraines or I or IBS exactly I've surf a lot from anxiety and yep the nervousness anxiety that's something I you know deal with in managing my own way but I mean everybody does have a way of managing it but this is we're seeing such a huge response in terms of anxiety yes what this will do now is it will bind to your receptors if you were anxious now it would deal with that problem never be anxious with you cherry ever knows what it does it's binds to these receptors and it puts you back in balance right gotcha so unfortunately because of our life today because of other stresses of life because of our diet because of the pollution because of the way that we live yeah our systems are more out of balance more and more unfortunately it's hitting on the head and that's what would you know we talked a lot about here at primer I mean if you meant a technology for example technology's meant to enhance that quality of life and make as more efficient how much does it in which makes me it just makes us more seemingly for me I can speak personally but more stressful but if you look at all the qualities of life absolutely right it's almost like we're again are we built for this amount of sorry I don't know you know that's the thing I think we're stressing our bodies more and more this is where is this is why I think this has become so important recently because as that happens so as you're stressed as you're anxious as you're our diet isn't maybe as good as it should be yeah our bodies basically go out balance and that's where this comes in yes because where your body can't produce enough cannabinoids it enough of its own cannabinoids yeah and where the receptors are starting to slow down and not work as well yeah in comes this yes so CBD does two things yes it encourages your body to produce its own cannabinoids again mm-hmm and what then all these cannabinoids are going to do is work with the receptors in your endocannabinoid system sorry for being so technical that's good it's good but I love this view it is you know love this we love learning it's empowering and it's exciting because you think I won't how do we not know about this until we salute yeah yeah but the bottom line is CBD helps to get your body back in balance right and when you're in balance you're not sick and when you're in balance you fit have more energy and when you're in balance it's just it just makes sense doesn't it when you're at optimum health you feel your best yeah and that is the simplest way I can put it is Brede is there to get you back into balance absolutely okay so just to recap I know we've got I hope you got me for that the whole show but some people depend about five minutes these are the CBD oils on offer today okay let's talk you through so I've got the you've got ten mill are over 8% 8% in strength with the toolbox we will come we're going to come to the Trent's a little I've got the 10 mil off if I put that there 20% and the bigger bottle as in with volume and this is 100 mil at 10% so in between the two and we've also got the solved to come yeah as well well goes to the 20% round just so the cameras can see you can see at home okay so so starting with the strength and who where do people begin who would be so we start with the 8% who would who'd you recommend that for okay so a lot of people come to us that have tried maybe two and a half percent or three percent or five percent from somewhere else right and I understand why people try that because it's more affordable okay because you're getting less CBD yeah yeah the reason why our eight percent is our entry level if you like is because that's where we believe you get benefits but also not everyone necessarily needs higher than that so it's a perfect place to start so we have lots of people coming to a set of tried CBD from elsewhere and that's where they start yeah because I personally think you have to you have to gauge what you need everyone's doing we're all different and we respond differently to so I could easily recommend okay go straight in with 20% but you might not need that it depends on what you're taking it for so my mum for example perfect example doesn't take it for a specific ailment she just takes yep said everyday to give a dose and keep her as a preventative perhaps as a preventative and there's a key thing all my friends and family now that take it yeah I say well why you might not take it for a specific ailment but don't wait to get ill too then say I need CBD or like Toby unfortunately but that's what happened with Tony a lot of people take it as a preventative now yeah because it's keeping you in balance yeah and if you go out of balance yeah then you're more likely to get sick it's what it's difficult to know whether what comes first yes body goes out of balance and you get a disease yeah yeah well you get a disease and it sends you out of balance either way yeah this helps to keep that homeostasis going I mean this I mean I can I know so many people buzzing about this right now the deal is are as in you're stripping you're watching this means the deals still here so the free phone number is on the screen there as well if you have any questions we've got more to bring you as well cherries brain to pick as we go on but you've got the the three different sizes of bottle and strengths as well and exceed the price is flashed up on the on the screen here now cherry just before we came to wear as well with the shelves talking to Terry about the the processes because I've really researched and other brands as I say and the extraction processes you don't downplay it but there's so much work so much passion and so much emphasis on your extraction process and I can I do you mind if I taught you about this because is it quite extraordinary so and and it again we talked about the safety of the quality and the efficiency but the extraction process of your and the pro-life CD can you talk us through yeah absolutely and this applies by the way to all three because the eight percent that we were just talking about is is the same in theory as the twenty percent the ten percent there is no range in quality they're all absolute top quality it's simply how much do you need to take so the eight percent is the entry level is is is something that most people most people would take for the first time and then you might go up to the ten percent or 20 percent but I just wanted to make it clear that every single one is the same quality same extraction yeah yeah it's just how much you want to each bottles but yes extraction it okay so I was reading there are some practice out there or for example using ethanol yeah this is now you can read about this online and there are many different opinions about this okay I guess pro-life approach we co2 extract so I'll try next time explain this sorry I put on this - there's so much - but no there is so much to it and it's very very scientific but the bottom line is everything we do is natural no pesticides no herbicides no alcohol anyway not yeah there is we do not cut a corner most companies now most use ethanol extraction and that basically means simply as I can put it you soak all of the hemp in ethanol mm-hmm yes it will get rid of your pesticides and herbicides you can't then fully extract the ethanol gotcha you don't want to take you don't want to be taking ethanol that's not the idea so we do co2 extraction and not just that it's this is I don't know whether it's too technical but we do supercritical co2 extraction this is this is what my I was being treated by when researching researching earlier before you before and we came to air is they you don't have to do this but the fact is you do because you're so passionate about this I feel like you have you have I feel like you have to do it to say that you were offering quality CBD because you take CBD for your health you can't then say on what on the one hand take it for your health but then oh but you're also taking F and although you've also got okay pesticides everything has to be all gotten and we are certified that's another thing is growing it organically grown organically and it's certified and we don't just certify it in the US where it's come from this is from Colorado by the way it's all from Colorado the best the best base that we know of in the world and our relationship with them is fantastic but they certified in Colorado it's certified in the UK and we certified in Spain which is the best lab in Europe because we want anybody who takes this whether they're buying from the UK Europe America to know that their local lab if you like also supports what we are doing it is the best that we can visit make we cannot do anything better to make it more natural more organic and higher-quality nothing all of these that you are seeing now on the screen are just showing to you yeah that we have full-spectrum oils we have zero THC zero psychoactive hallucinogenic right so that that can I just yeah come to that because so so obviously so can you get high off CBD no why no you mentioned THC can you explain a bit more about THC I don't want THC to be seen as something bad because actually it has phenomenal the reason what they found the Inuk endocannabinoid system 30 years ago is because they were testing the effect of THC on the body and just for our viewers explain what what THC is THC is tetra hydro kind of a doll yeah just it was the HD yeah it's another compound so it's Warner for the 100 and I think 112 maybe more all of these compounds are in the hemp plant THC is the only one that has a psychoactive effect the only one that is illegal okay and it's not found in here right yeah no it's not in here not in family Hitler no nothing it's not found in our CBD oil and actually anyone who's selling legally has to be at it's less than 0.03 percent you have to have less than 0.03 percent for it to be legal okay in the u.s. I think it's less than 0.05 okay we have there we don't have less than we have there and we make sure that it's all tested to prove that there is not less than naught point naught 3 it's just zero there's nothing found no trace when it should and it should say yeah it says th see on the screen there and be determined at all yeah and that's really key for us because there is no doubt in your mind that this has any psychoactive properties at all because we do see I mean children take it so much and my family my relatives my friends clients that come to us ask them that you're giving it to their children it's very important I can say hand on heart there is zero psychoactive element in there not true rather than just oh yeah there's less now yeah we just eliminate it completely yeah okay so go come back to the CBD that we have here again talk about the quality of it talk about the concentration this trains a little bit in a second or so but can you overdose no as far there's been zero reports of overdosing because because this is something you naturally produced in your body cannabinoids that's what's in that bottle cannabinoids yeah and a little bit of a carrier oil whether that's coconut oil or hemp work but that's totally natural as well yeah so everything in there in terms of the compounds that cannabinoids we we are we are known to produce them ourselves yeah so you you can't take too much so we will talk about dosages and how much people take or how many how much people take for different conditions but if you had half a pipette there's a quarter you're fine there there's no problem okay and what about if I'm on medication different kinds of medication what's its relationship with that so everybody is different again I've not had one single report at all of it interfering the medication but always check because because what it is doing is restoring balance in your body right now I can talk to you actually about my own experience with this so I've been on the highest doses of medication for my epilepsy for eight years or so mm-hmm and they kept trying to stop my seizures from happening and nothing worked nothing worked nothing eventually medicine came through and I have been on the highest dose of the medication I can take four for eight years until this came in now I along with my doctor said okay I don't want to be on strong medication for my whole life yeah because it has its own effects on you it's right numbing and I was tired and so what I've slowly done is taken as much CBD as I think I need and reduce my medication now I've done that with the support of my doctor and I would always recommend that you ask the question yeah always that chat with your GP yeah I'm a living and yeah there's nothing to be there's nothing to hide here there yeah absolutely it's encouraged and more and more doctors I mean we've talked about this before doctors are coming through saying we've got actually I'm not sure if Elliott can find it but we had a doctor he was anti all of this right I've been in the medical medical profession for a long time and he is apologize has come out and apologized and said I was so wrong I'm so sorry and he's one of the biggest supporters now there is dr. Sanjay Gupta one of the biggest supporters of CBD right now and please research him because he's he's so famous and he's such a credible person to to tell you all about the amazing benefits but yeah going back to your question it's safe but but ask the question that's so high and that's it about education empowering ourselves pooling our intelligences but yeah do check with you obviously with your with your personal GP or the yeah speak to speak meet two people and get to get that advice as well any side effects have you known off of these we've had we've had no reports of side effects and I thought we can ask something nice we I mean because we're dealing we deal with people daily yes from having anxiety through to cancer through to Parkinson's I mean serious serious serious illnesses like we discussed on that list and you think with the amount of medication they're on mm-hmm with how they're feeling anyway even if they confuse their nausea with taking CBD but we have not had a single person come back to us and say I've had this negative side of us extraordinary is it is extraordin painkillers or you know things that we take some people will have a negative start most people won't but some people will have a negative side effect this we have had zero side effects reported actually now as I say when you can it is available elsewhere well what I'm asking you right now is what makes the pro life CBD different in its quality that's the simplest way that is it a lot of people are selling CBD because it seems on trend at the moment yes same with anything that happens and I look we've seen a lot of people close down in the last in the last year including the company that sold as the dud CBD photo be in the first folks they've gone and will see that more and more its pro-life CBD is going to be the best CBD available well because we make sure we come week that we are up to date with new press and I've seen this area I've seen with you on Toby you're so incredibly power about and also what I'm actually buzzing about that what you've you brought to us are the different strengths so you looked at the 8% yes now the 20% strengths can you talk us to who would you recommend this sauce this is in the the middle bottle here okay so this is 10 millimeters let's use this for that is currently a best seller and it changes all the time but 20% okay this is for people who generally found that 8% is giving them amazing results yeah yeah and that is it is incredible for for that reason because you don't necessarily need more than the 8% but people just love it and want they want they feel like they want to help them as much as they possibly can it doesn't actually necessarily work that way if you if you have the 8% you can still take more of it like I said the quality is the same throughout yeah it's not the 20% it's better quality the quality is the same throughout it's just stronger so you need to take a little bit okay so the strong it's a yes it's quite self-explanatory out of 10 but yes and strongly is the less you need to take perhaps so you can manage it yourself and so if you if you if the 8% is got four I think it's four milligrams a drop uh-huh yeah they're about yeah yeah and and the 20 will be 10 10 milligrams so it's very popular though endure all probably unfortunately it's very popular because we have a lot of people now coming to us with very serious conditions right okay so not everyone needs to 20% but there's a lot of people that have serious serious problems that need the 20% and actually we've got requests for an even higher percentage which we're looking at yeah but that's basically what it supports for more serious conditions but it like we said earlier you can't take too much with anybody so it's just this it's the strongest quality sorry the stronger strength that we strongest percentage yeah and I think we touched upon it earlier when I was doing research and research and research and I know you there's nothing you don't know about this but when I've looked elsewhere and the the a percent is the lowest percent we have here but that seems to be beyond of some people's highest percent that's why we do it you know we truly believe if we're honest we could offer a 20 pound bottle bottle if we did two and a half percent or five percent we don't believe that good enough effects yeah and so for the extra 20 pounds 10 pounds 30 pounds how much value you put on your help this is the thing and we think there's no point in offering a lower percentage because it doesn't do enough that's just our philosophy just what we believe why yes we are stronger than everyone else and maybe a little bit more expensive than other people but at least we're seeing massive benefits from that customers it's just the home of quality CBD it's experience has the highest quality so just to recap so we've been looking at the 20% which is in the hundred mill bottle again with the pipette that looks like a 10 mil forgive me 10 mil so 20 percent all the detail on the screen the Oh 800 number and must stress as well and they're all popular this again for many is there the one of choice by getting it's down to your which one you're liking the look off or or Lottie will subscribe to these as well so yeah the number there are 800 number to get involved and ok so that was a little my taste but I've tasted it it's a very distinctive taste it's not exact it's a how did you find out if you haven't tried these like nothing I think that it's an earthly it's not unpleasant don't get me wrong it's not unpleasant at all but it's not it's I can't sort of compartmentalize it feels I said organic feels it's real come to that yeah so yes we talk about that but we use well we used offer as the carrier oil so it has to go into an oil it has to be in a carrier oil and these three that you're seeing today are in MCT coconut oil okay which has a hole so this is another sch\u00f6nox ane so just very briefly what are the benefits of having it with coconut oh well it's it helps with your metabolism it's bacterial it's it just has so many so many health benefits on its own yeah so it's just good generally for your health people take I mean my mum takes a spoonful of coconut oil every morning just yeah just another supplement well we we love here at problem we love coconut it's always a welcome addition to why we did it because we thought well if we can put it in coconut oil hemp oil is also amazing yeah and we used to offer that that was very earthy yes no I think this coconut oils neutralized it a little bit so it's I I feel more like I'm taking coconut oil than the hemp was a little bit more earthy a little bit stronger in taste but I my preference well in fact not just not just me we followed our feedback and as you know you can pay a premium for quality coconut oil yeah no please yes increase the price here or anything that I so know now I get the benefit of that as well and timeframes there's always intrigued me about things like this and so so so somebody tries lost that with do I feel something straightaway what's the how long should I take it forward ongoing yeah well your sort of thoughts on that it well I kind of touched on it but didn't expand early wrong because it's so much to talk about so yeah it this is what blows me away every single day and I don't get used to it and this is why I can't see it we can't sit here and talk testimonials because I cry last time poppy and I were both in tears you didn't show it just to if you did miss that show I know many many of you will of course it and you did show it poppy yeah it was quite emotional though it is but it's emotional all the time because like I said we started this because Toby was poorly yeah not because we intended to help the world the feeling that you get when you're helping so many people yeah and they are so thankful it's a long talk about right that's it there are just a moment we flush them up they're awesome on the problem living website as well yeah please do have a look and and and have a look at any reviews because they are amazing and we don't shy away from them at all they they fascinate me every day we have a new problem every day we have a new new illness every day we have a new review and it's just incredible to thousands and thousands of people that come to us and thank us will come to us and say please help me it is the most rewarding thing I've ever done and that's why I don't see it as a business I don't sit here as I do sit here is founder of relaxing but you might be so proud and I can see that coming from you and we're very proud to have the partnership as well I'm proud that we found it yeah I mean there are shortcuts we can make it cheaper you can make it quicker we can use other I always think you down pay this is what I'm saying I tell you never put that of the amout the work that goes into say the extraction the safety and he yeah you know I think sorry going back to your question you gone off on a tangent know what what amazes me more than anything else first of all there in the cannabinoid system and the fact that it exists and can do this this oil from a plant can do something so magical yeah but you I've witnessed and please look at this on line because it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see in your life I have witnessed somebody having an epileptic fit or somebody physically shaking with Parkinson's stop within seconds mmm-hmm how how is that it's it's a miracle to me yeah it's very moving it's extraordinary it is so the answer is yes immediate immediate so not everybody don't get so wrong not everybody feels in the median but if you think what I just did the top what moments to be feeling now he said people who are in pain people who have arthritis people who have Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety panic leaf illnesses are sleeps huge so you can take it before sleep and I guarantee if you've never taken CBD before if the first time you take it you will have one of the best night's sleep you've ever had because and the reason I can guarantee that is because every single person has given me that feedback we've talked before about Poppy's nan Tobi with his sleep because he was so anxious when he was poorly sleep was amazing but it does have an immediate effect because we've seen that in the likes of epilepsy Parkinson's and also the lovely lady who was really struggling with panic attacks is adjusting her dose at the moment because she's getting anxious going into busy situations right a shopping mall a meeting yeah somewhere somewhere where she feels that it's gonna be a lot of people that's what she struggles with yeah a lot of people do right you know to some level it's always do different volumes of it absolutely the biggest biggest topics well in the world right now yeah mental health is people talking about it a little bit more willing to talk about it great yeah it's a bit more as you say more people are I don't know is it more open more open more education towards it but as you say people are people sharing and we're coming across something like CVD that's actually giving people an answer which is so amazing not everybody wants to take prescription jokes not everyone wants to admit that they possibly have something that they need help with yeah this is a natural totally organic natural that you're not taking drugs you're not taking anything from from a pharmacy yeah and people are much more comfortable with that yeah I mean we're getting there there's always been this stigma around the the psychoactive side the THC as more and more people are coming to us listening to us there's a lot more education a lot more doctors scientists researchers yes saying this is safe yeah this is changing people's lives we're getting there very slowly and so it's I mean everyone's just going going crazy for it and of course as we say hit primal living always checked with your GP your doctor for advice and again ask those questions about empowering ourselves and again the emphasis of Juno will here at prom living is education learning those facts so you can make the informed decisions as opposed to scrambling in the it's crumbling in the in the dark we've got the big bottle to talk about now okay now this is big I mean we'll talk about them well it'll work what you're getting okay okay say this is the big bottle yeah okay and the strength of this 10% yes so sits between so it's this was the debate at the beginning what do we do what strengths what sizes and there's a constant requests for different things okay can I have a 40% gonna have a 30ml but still kinda happy we're working on it but trust us we're getting there that it's what do we do how do we do it effectively cost-effectively for you if we would see the 20% for example in a big bottle yes I'll be talking a lot money right and so it's we're trying to meet your needs absolutely but we're just deciding on where we take it next so eight percent as an entry level people want to try it yes they don't necessarily want to buy big bottle immediately understandable that's why we have the eight percent in the small bottle twenty percent in a smaller bottle again to help with the price it's the 10% that's where every single member of my family that's what they've got yet so that's there oh yeah the middle ground uh-huh so I find if you ask me I had if I had to pick one bottle that we could only supply one bottle it would be that one because I find most people that's where most people are well families are all temperament family size your question is family size bottle - no you're right actually it's them exactly that for we've had a lot of people who have tried and then said okay I want all my families to take it yeah and exactly that it's on it's there in the kitchen in the morning everyone has their their dose and off they go and so just to put again so you're putting this booklet so if you were taking the recommended dose of you drop's a time how long guesstimate would you say a bottle of the size would last you yeah it's difficult to say because of because you decide how much you take but as a rule I would say six months Wow okay and that that it is the most cost effective way yes terms of price per drop that's your bottle yeah and that is for everybody most people go from the eight percent quite quickly to either the twenty will attend because the ten percent gives you that longevity so you don't have to you don't have to worry about ordering three weeks later yes and of course you have the subscription though so you can do do it however you wish but that does last yeah so I would say my grandma and granddad yeah about six months in there's two of them so that's that's my benchmark for them but it's it's the most popular bottle foot what people say okay I need this in my life yeah I'm gonna take it every day then that's the boss they go for that's acetate okay so you can see the all the oils and the size and the strength on the on the website on the graphics right now you can see the big family bottle or the big bottle if it's just for you which is ten percent and I mean this is extraordinary just again for people just just spin it Victor on Terry and say well I appreciate what you I sit I've seen it elsewhere lower price what's what do you come back to that it's available but the quality is inferior quality yeah it's everything I don't mean to put everybody else am so that's not fair either okay there are good companies out there and CBD bottom line CBD is good the problem is it's how you how its extracted yes so what else is in that bottled it yeah you don't want to be taking ethanol you don't want pesticides you don't want any any nasties in there yeah some people are cutting corners and therefore you have got nasties in them or you will see a more affordable there are still good companies out there offering more affordable yes but it's two and a half cent so you'd have to take so much of that to feel the effect of one drop of well more drops for one drop of irate dissent yeah we sort of asking the questions I believe many people asking at home but I've done so much research on CBD and I'm not seeing anything like anything like the quality you're getting here out there this kind of a price value sorry sorry I've just passed again it's hard not to get passionate when you hear their stories and and and I feel as though we're doing a disservice because we have an hour show which is a long time and but we should be down as far as I just on that note yeah I can sit here very confidently and so I do not believe there is better quality available in the UK America we've basically taken that amazing company in America yeah I bought it here we've we found out where they got it from why they were so good why this little girl was you know went from 300 seizures to nothing so yeah and we wanted that and we said that's what's missing yeah and that's what we are providing is there's nothing we can do better nothing and now you might have called net all-natural ingredients to go yeah you brought an image of the of the farm can you talk us through there we go that little well big him blow that is Colorado a for you so look out look how laughing that looks I like to walk through that wonderful now families we mentioned and can see be CBD with what's the deal with children it's safe to take yeah all well what circumstances would a child be given to a child for example okay so any that's the thing is in what in one respect is no different to adults I mean we started like talk about that little girl it's very very common in children with epilepsy no probably one in the when I first started researching CBD that's probably the biggest thing that came up yeah always check again always check GP yes medication yeah and especially for younger children yeah that can't communicate with you just always check the reason I've grown ups who want to explore this is an avenue obviously getting the advice first questions it's so common yeah like you said it's so common that children take it there was a Elliott we got is an art school just friend of ours Jo sent it to me the other day and I love this because so many people like you are passionate this is the first time we've sat in talks about this and I can know what you tell you're passionate so many of my friends and family are passionate so many of our clients more passionate it just picks people up along the way they're the more people and it's just hard not also people are so excited to tell me things yeah are you mentioned a research team things every day and our friend Te'o sent us an article the other day about how about breast milk actually and how research has found confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk and look if you just look at that quote it's one line from this article according to the findings of several major scientific extends human breast milk naturally contains the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant which are vital for proper human development now what that's basically telling us is from the moment that a child is born they are getting cannabinoids from breast milk it's extraordinary so this is why I say this is what we are providing CBD is they cannabinoid yeah the difference is you might you might hear endo verses fighter and doe cannabinoids are from within us we reduce them 5 towers plant yeah that's it so as far as I'm concerned please look online have a look there's a lot of research and scientists and doctors that support children taking it and the results that children are getting for epilepsy and certain certain diseases incredible again and I don't know many many of our customers become a Pasteur's for in their own in their own yeah there's no impassionate way but of course do check with DPS and doctors before just we've got the South which is a remove is the is new rave and buzzing about just before we get there just something about travel laws Airport when you did touch upon it earlier and watch see what's the deal is could I take it to the airport for example or what you need to do is just check before you go then it's legal in the country you're going to so there is we need it on our website actually but if you've gone on to primal livings website there is a list of countries as to where it's legal might it's not there are a couple that it's travel size in the in the year and in most OB where I've been I've taken him yeah but check check and don't want you to get confiscated at the airport because you wait in trouble that they will confiscate it from you you know you don't want that so just make sure that wherever you're going it they accept it and also do a recent checkers look as things change laws are changing so that it's become legal in so many countries over the last few years which is great but yeah just a couple couple I came behind just double check ok this South and now everybody in the office buzzing everybody again with customers as well so talk us through the stuff so this way of doing a target to local Ike toca target though you talk to be on the skin so it's Lindsay description that's exactly that it's the same way for example you wouldn't necessarily way I can think to describe it this I always think work from the inside out so for any kind of illness take the oil that's what I that's how I yes see it just think it's your best way however you wouldn't graze your arm right take a paracetamol necessarily yeah and I think of it in the same way you puts a blood on it and the brands are available sorry but you'd put a cream on it for example same thing if you've got a spray yeah or you've got something like and psoriasis is a big is a huge thing at the moment yeah in fact one of my lovely clients recently has been I've never seen anyone so excited that her psoriasis has got better from this self that and you apply it topically like you would a cream so it's targeting a specific so I still say take the oil I mean I've every one who buys herself I say take the oil as well because work from the inside out yeah but for something that is more of an external problem and is the anti-inflammatory yes it's got I mean let's just it sorry I'm just checking it has got in here and I always have said because of that much in there we've got the coconut oil we've got the beeswax we've got the argan oil we've got rosehip oil we've got geranium oil we have eucalyptus lavender essential oil and then cannabinoid which him so it has got the there was actually a there is I won't name names but there is a fantastic moisturizer that I use it I think it's the best in the world basically what we've done is taken all the ingredients of the one of the best moisturizers and added in the CBD which is of course what will help the healing process and I'm noticing an absence for example of petroleum and things you know that can crop up everything I mean you could eat that if don't don't but yeah and it's there's nothing harmful in there it's all totally natural absolutely and we know we absolutely adore our essential oils here at prime anything so this is the the Sal and I really in the production before as well be said Nicolas make sure you say it's well stocks last I was gonna say because probably said earlier that the staff is really popular really limited and we are also limited so unfortunately we are behind a little bit in because it's been so popular we're struggling to keep up with demand on well on everything but especially itself just one thing while I remember as well with the self not only for skin conditions enjoyed pain I've never heard so I didn't expect this so many people have reported for things like cold sores and just have spots okay yeah up quickly it's got rid of them yes of course we all know how long spot can hang around for all code so unfortunately and swearing by unfortunately I haven't I haven't had one you know but all my word people are swearing by that yeah I resides as well repetitive strain injuries yeah so this post surgery yeah yeah post-surgery foot recovery alongside physio proposed rain it's everything I mean everything you can think of where you would think to apply for example heat yes all the opposite poles that's what it's gonna do for you yeah but also this equally skin conditioner as a moisturizer people use it as a moisturizer people use it as a lip balm mm-hm because it's natural so everything you're putting on your skin is natural can I use on my face yes yeah so the only thing I would say about that if I'm totally honest you can use it on your face a friend of the family recently had really bad acne and put it all over her face the only thing I would suggest is you do that at night time okay cuz it isn't all it is oily still yeah and so I put it on a night time and then it's on for that period of time wash your face in the morning because yeah I'm not sure how I make it would react with it yeah I haven't tried that but that's what I would suggest is that almost put it on as a night cream if you're gonna put it on your face okay and havoc so we talking it's 50 ml inside yes and how much CBDs in this we have got 300 milligrams in there okay so that's what we have found everything that we do is based on research basic yeah yeah what's what what's needed we don't want to put more than you need in there and that seems to be the the amount that people are really getting benefits far as the optimum yeah of level and concentration the the bomb by the way is very when you open it it looks quite hard once you get going with it it's it becomes more malleable but that is also to make sure that you don't know that happens a lot with natural ingredients anyway he hasn't it you have to study gonna make it more malleable okay so there in a nutshell with the with the cell what can it help with with itself in their self anything external any so grazes and this is where kids come back in as well I mean the amount kids fall over and you just put yeah interestingly because my daughter's knees gets tougher for than white boys days yeah Jesus well you know we scarlet running around so yeah so we absolutely right so so perfect that exactly but of course like you said only arrived after the gym that's popular for that muscle soreness post surgery and anything external that you think Xmas Isis yes and most skin conditions in fact every skin condition that we have helped it has worked with if you're concerned like we keep saying if you're concerned ask your doctor but generally you can apply it like you would a moisturizer or like you would other creams that are available and you just rub it in yeah well it will get to work I'm thinking about after shaving perhaps as well again yeah great so the great thing about it is I also use I use an aloe vera a lot yeah you can't ally beer with Sarah Leon to open skin of course yeah so for things like cuts I had made this mistake with Charlie my stepson and it jellyfish yeah sting yeah I know oh yeah oh my word he went through the roof because it was still actually even though it didn't look like an open yeah weave but it's still so saw so as much as I love aloe vera brilliant and this doesn't have any of that stinging property so you can put it directly on a cut gotcha so whether it's because some people are such bad skin conditions where it's almost that open open wound open sores but actually this is very soothing there's nothing in there that will make it sting mm-hmm so yeah after shaving be great and you've seen the deals here just extraordinary please I mean I'm gonna do it my personal email address out again it's Nick at primarily living Calm it's Nick and I see cap please feedback to what your experiences and enjoying the growing groups of people who are so passionate and that CVD and passionate about this particular quality that we've got here so just go over again the the size of the bottles and the strengths as well and just feel free survive survive was leaving stop with to drop the what you sky was an entry level eight percent that's where everyone starts nearly everybody starts and I would advise it because if you are coming if you are currently taking something from somewhere else yes and it's a lower percentage see the difference I want to experience yeah I want you to experience the difference between a five percents from somewhere else yeah I'm taking our 8% because I want you yeah there it would be yep see the difference yeah and it you can gauge from that whether you need more yes so if you're getting through the 8% ball so quickly you use it you might think okay I want a high strength or people stay at 8% and that's just enough to you know as a daily supplement fantastic so that's the ten mill at 8% yeah and then we've got jump to 20% in strength again with ten mill yep with ten melt so that is our highest strength currently and that is taken by well there's two ways of looking at it it's taken by people with more serious illnesses who need the higher strength or want the higher strength mm-hmm or it's taken by customers who maybe want to take less so of course if there's four milligrams in an eight in the Apes impulse will per job yeah ten milligrams in the 20% bottle per drop you just have to take less so yeah it is premium popular at the moment I think because people want to be taking as much CBD as possible but same quality same quality within both it's just how much you ingest okay gross we've got about a minute left on show so again a perfect forum travel size with these smaller bottles and we described more as the family size now this sits percentage-wise in the mid-water down the middle between a 10% 10% that's what we have found to be the most popular requested suitable yeah presenters that people want and that's a hundred mil and that's hundred bill the reason why it's a hundred mil is because exactly that people want to buy in in a big box and it's in the cell now as and then then finally of course we've got the self 50 mils of selves and and we've really got across marine sale mode now quick how do you get involved how do you get in touch how do you get to own

Matz thank you so much for joining us give us a ring and make these yours", "WonzWlgPwJA": "[Music] Nihao everybody thank you for tuning in to mis TV today be sure to hit like and subscribe it's today we're gonna cover a new slightly unorthodox but very popular aspect of vaping C B D what is CB d now CBD which is an abbreviation of canna video is a completely legal non psychoactive extract taken from the larger cannabis plant now unlike the illegal yet far more popular tetrahydrocannabinol or THC CBD has had all psychoactive compounds stripped away from it meaning it has all of the shall we say physical effects of the plant without any of the mental effects of traditional cannabis now people have been using cannabis and cannabis derived medicines for years to treat many different symptoms however many are a little bit nervous about engaging with the devil's lettuce due to elements such as it illegality the sometimes complicated nature of procuring it wherever you are obviously you should be doing that because it's illegal and also the slightly nerve inducing or paranoiac aspects of it that many people do suffer from when trying to use it as a medicine now traditional THC operates on the body's cb1 receptors many of which are located in the brain CBD is a little different CBD operates on the body's cb2 receptors which are located primarily in the body's inflammatory system meaning that the effects of the substance are entirely physical and whilst not straying into language that I cannot use all of its effects are going to be those which operate on your body's inflammatory system so if you find you are having issues that involve inflammation CBD can be a very powerful compound now as you're probably aware by this point you are watching this video after all CBD is growing in popularity at a rapid pace here in brighton and hove alone we already have CBD specialist or CBD products told from help senses CBD dispensaries even cafes and kitchens which specialize in CBD infused cannabis and other foods containing CBD but you're here because you're interested in vaping now what would be the benefits of vaping it there are some when vaping CBD it enters the bloodstream far quicker than when ingesting it orally or using it as a topical balm this immediate and strong onset of effect can provide a lot of its users with a greater sense of control over the symptoms that they are choosing to treat with it and generally speaking when people vape it they can be very confident in the fact that they have a very determined idea of exactly what their dosages and when and how they're going to apply it now if you've chosen to vape CBD there are a couple avenues you can take some of which are related to ease of use other ones about more precise dosage and control of dosage now the easiest thing that you can do would be to purchase something like one of these ten mil pre-mixed CBD infused e-liquid by us here at mist the e-liquid clocking in at a hundred milligrams which is a fairly reasonably strong dose one that you'll certainly get the chance to feel and a great way to experiment with the subject with the substance without having to worry about it being too strong too weak anything like that using something like this all you would need to do is purchase yourself a simple mouth to lung kit or some kind of POD system and then like usual just go about filling it the way that you normally would no complication to it and those strangeness and like usual just pop it in the side and fill up to about the top of your window I do specify the use of a mouth to lung machine like this because the majority of pre-mixed CBD II liquids are going to be very PG heavy they're rarely very thick however there are as an alternative we would recommend these these are what we refer to as CBD booster shots these are effectively CBD top-ups all you would need to be doing is getting an empty tank popping in something like two to four to six droplets of this substance in there and then just filling it the rest of the way with your favorite eliquid these booster shots generally are going to be a little bit pricier than the pre-mixed ones but this is because they are going to last you these are far stronger coming in 500 milligram and a thousand milligrams spectively you will need to be adding this by the droplet now don't worry about getting nervous about measurements here on our website just type in CBD calculator we have a very simple to use robust system that will take a few details from you like how much CBD do you have let's say 10 mils of it how strong is it let's say 500 milligrams grant how big is your tank probably a 2 mil tank if you bought it in the UK and then what's your preferred daily dosage and then you just type that in hit the button that will instantly tell you how many drops of CBD booster to add to your tank so as to infuse it and infuse your favorite a liquid with your daily dosage now there are a couple different varieties of CBD that are used in a liquid and the mist range uses a particular one known as full-spectrum CBD as opposed to the previous industry standard of CBD isolate CBD isolate is painstakingly extracted from the plant and it's an extremely pure process they just take the absolutely necessary CBD from the plan the CBD we use here at mist is referred to as full-spectrum CBD full-spectrum as a post isolate takes everything it legally can from the plant so as to give you the most possible good in your substance we hope we've given you some good

the channel if it's your first time this is the channel all things hemp for review CBD hemp and wellness we talk about the religious trends of course we take our reviews and we talk about well just what are the best practices around CBD in a have well before we start this tincture of you I just want to say I hope everyone's staying safe I hope everybody's healthy during this time goodness so many things are happening in the world right now but nevertheless I'm just happy that you're right here on the channel and there you were able to share moment together and as we cover this review of course if you feel tired take a nap if you feel sore stretch this isn't gonna be a longer view but I just wanted to make you feel at home here so without further ado let's get into this tincture of you so this is the bloom Farms balanced tincture review this is a local brand from Oakland California from the Bay Area and this is our home here at all things hemp we're located on Grand Ave we're filming this in the Bay Area and I just want to say thank you so much for saying this product over to us well it's a great product I used it for about week and a half and it fit in perfectly within my within my CBD regimen and I got great results from it of course I'm gonna give you more details than that this is a full spectrum CBD solvent free meaning that the way it's extracted is without any additives which is super important because it's the cleanest the cleanest most pristine you can get of all CBD products right here nevertheless it is phenomenal it actually tastes not amazing or again set in a bit but the if I felt was definitely efficacious I mean when I took it I definitely felt that relaxation and I was kind of surprised because I found myself kind of taking less CBD than I usually take probably because it has because it's a 300 milligram and I'm used to taking a certain about of CBD about 30 milligrams per day I didn't want to have to keep I don't want to have to keep taking a therapeutic dose every single time which is about one and a half actual temperature measurements um so basically I didn't I would just take a full one but the thing about these most of these tinctures even with the leading brands of CBD tinctures when you go through the process of actually opening it and extracting the CBD and getting into the actual into the actual millimeter drop the the one millimeter dropper or milliliter goodness knows um I don't you don't always get it I usually get about 75 percent of the way there with the full one so it typically leads me to taking about a formal a full one for a full dose of this it be a full one or at least 75 milliliters and then another 25 milliliters yes milliliters not no meters no meters is a measurement to know leaders is a also measurement but it's not a distance it lives in amount ooh goodness anyways this is a great product why should you buy this product well for one they donate a meal to it's called the bloom Farms one for one and they're one for one company and for every every item purchase they donate meal to somebody need which is super awesome I I know for a fact that this time we need more love anymore we need more meals given to people who are in need we need more CBD for a lot of people that are stressed goodness nevertheless why should you also buy this product well recently in the midst of there have been riots there have been some aberrations and these unfortunately lead to small businesses that I love Flik bloom being broken into and bloom recently was a victim of being looted and they were cleaned out completely for my knowledge and I felt terrible because all things temp is also a CVD company and after we heard that we of course boarded up but nevertheless no local business no business that is giving out a meal for anybody of that is buying a product should be looted and this is undisputable nevertheless of course this is a great product and this is probably a great time to buy their products if they're in stock but just show support to bloom and our love from all things have goes out to bloom at this time goodness and even more so for the black lives matter movement I am African American and I can't help but notice that where did that black people are discriminated in this country and goodness woah to put to put it simply I was when I first moved here to the Bay Area I was a cop I was pulled over and I had five guns to my to my to my head it's the back of my head basically being held up at a stop because they thought my car was involved in the robbery and the description was a 45 year old black man I really hope I don't look 45 and they realized that they didn't even know the description of the person until I was in handcuffs and actually detained and you know this isn't an easy to talk about but this is just the truth of what goes on in America goodness nevertheless I'm just thankful I'm thankful to live in this country and I am thankful to be able to do these videos and occupy a small space on the web I'm thankful for you checking out our videos but the discrimination and the injustice is towards african-americans I really hope in all minorities people of color really hope it comes to an back to the review so because I take typically three hundreds of Wow 13 milligrams per day not 330 milligrams per day maybe 48 give or take how many is going this is something that this is a temperature that I took quite a bit of I am just quite a bit of I took quite often because of its own it's only about sewing 10 milligrams per drop for a full dropper and because it's only 10 minutes per full dropper and I'm only getting about 75% of that I would have to take more of course I wasn't taking as much because sometimes I would just say you know forget it I'll just take this in 75% which I've still felt that really if I still felt that um the therapeutic effects of CBD and I slept great on this route felt felt much less anxious it was a great week I

cbdsupplymd.com", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "2Vbu8pYLqWg": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is myra in today's video i'll be sharing with you a haul i made from a brand called truly beauty i was interested in some of the items so i wanted to share them with you all and if you are interested in watching this video please continue with us and if you like to subscribe to my channel i will be very thankful for that i know it helps my channel a lot and also if you enjoy while watching don't forget to give this video a thumbs up so i have many many products for them right now i have about 20 products i was interested in other products as well but this is what i got and just to put it out there i want to let you all know that this video is not sponsored i purchased all of these items with my own money i am going to show these items in three different categories i am going to show you skin care hair care and body care as well so first of all let me go ahead and start with hair care i guess i was interested in this shampoo and conditioner these are the super plant shine and hydration sulfate free and let me tell you that these products they have no fragrance so i really liked that about these products here they are also vegan clean high performing animal cruelty free and they are also made in the usa with global ingredients um i'm very interested in these because apparently these are curly girl friendly so i want to see how they work on my hair i don't practice the curly girl method 100 but um i know that some of y'all might do that that's why i decided to pick these items and try them out i also got this hair mask well i got two of them actually these are also curly girl friendly apparently according to the ingredients on the back and this first one is called rainbows in mirrors split end treatment hair mask it has avocado vitamin f argan oil boost so we'll see how this works i don't have split ends but you know anything that gives me a little pamper i'll be happy with and then also this one is called star fruit and this hair mask helps with hydration and shine which i'm all about that i need that in my hair and it contains buddha's hand chamomile and coconut oil boost so i'm also interested in this one we'll see how this works on my hair um and then another hair mask that i got as you can see i love hair masks this next one is called um unicorn locks and it is a repair hair masks it says it targets split ends dull and damaged hair it contains coconut oil banana avocado cocoa butter and keratin amino acids so this one looks very very interesting to me and um let me see how if i can smell these products okay so i was opening this mess right here and this lid is so heavy it's actually crazy how heavy it is so it feels very very luxe and the scent is very pleasant as well i really i'm really looking forward to trying this mask so far i think out of the ones that i've been mentioning this one looks the most interesting to me so let me also show you what i purchased in the skincare category which i got about six items in this one this one right here is a vegan collagen cleanser i this one was the only one that i purchased at ulta um i was already placing an order there and this one was the most appealing from the items that they have on there ulta does carry truly beauty but i know they don't carry all of the items they have quite a few in there but like i said this one was a one that um was really eye-catching to me and this is a vegetable it has i'm sorry vegetable collagen organic jojoba oil retinol and vitamin c boost um this looks also very interesting it's supposed to help your skin feel tighter younger and plump skin i mean who doesn't want that right now so i'm also interested in this one um this doesn't seem to have a scent at least i don't i can't tell it has a scent because the hair mask got a little bit of my hand and that's what i'm smelling right now and i don't see a scent in this so i guess that's a plus for this one and then i also purchased the purple rain glow serum this contains retinol glycolic acid and antioxidant boost so this one also seems very interesting to me let me put a little bit out it has absolutely no sense at all and it does feel very soft and very smooth yeah this one has no scent either so that's also a plus very looking forward to putting that on my face and then also i got this eye candy cream this is for puffiness on your eyes so we'll see how this one works as well um it contains very good ingredients that's why i picked this one up as well it has aloe vera grapeseed oil jojoba seed oil coconut oil cocoa butter spirulina vitamin e white willow bark extract hyaluronic acid tocopherol which is vitamin e witch hazel sea kelp phenoxyethanol and i believe that's it so this one's eye cream looks very interesting um it doesn't seem like it's supposed to help with wrinkles i guess it's just aimed for puffiness on your eyes which i'll probably be wearing this one in the morning since that's when i get more puffiness on my eyes and obviously it doesn't have any scent with the ingredients that i just read the consistency seems very whipped so that looks very interesting let me show it to you guys that looks very that consistency looks whipped so i am also looking forward to putting this on my eyes for that morning puffiness that i always get in the morning and then i also purchased this glass skin facial serum this was also interesting because i believe all of the products that i got um i was very careful at reading all the ingredients on almost every product if not all all the products on their website and i think i got the ones that don't have any alcohol and if they do have alcohol they're going it's going to be organic alcohol which that should be a little bit better for your skin and let me see let me see the consistency this looks very creamy and no scent again i know most of their products have fragrance in them or natural fragrance these from the ones that i purchased i think only four of them don't have any fragrance at all and let me see yeah this feels very light it feels smooth um so i'm looking forward to wearing this one as well and testing it out you could blend it easily you can tell that the skin is absorbing it so that looks very intriguing too i'm very very excited to try all of these products out they look so interesting and then the last two for skin care are lip products which right now in these winter months my lips have been very drying and i have been testing out a few lip balms so since i was already going to do a big purchase i go ahead and picked these this one first it's called big juicy lip oil it contains coconut and hyaluronic acid this lip oil is supposed to help plump and hydrate your lips i love how the ingredients are very minimal in this one there's only i think i see five or six ingredients and it also includes vitamin a you know which that is um a form of retinol and this looks also very interesting it looks very lightweight so i'll be definitely testing this one now to see if it helps with plumpness because obviously it's going to help for hydration with the coconut oil and the hyaluronic acid so i'll check that out if see to see if it helps with plumpness on my lips and i also love that it comes in a glass packaging just like this purple rain serum so that's very that's very beautiful on the packaging um and then also i have this one this also comes in a glass and this is a this is called luscious lip butter it has peppermint and hyaluronic acid so this is also very intriguing it should help with hydration and oh this is this looks so pretty this is a whip consistency as well and it has a very light scent but i cannot it's very mild i don't think it has any fragrance either the letters are super tiny but um i'm definitely interested in this this looks pretty thick this is thick so it should last a while oh yeah that's like a butter consistency it looks very thick so maybe this is gonna last a while which that's a big a big plus and then now i'm going to share with you guys what i got for body care which i am so excited for these items i got one two three six items as well for body care um i didn't get the ones that they um promote a lot the ones for your upper body and the ones for your for your lower body i didn't purchase any of those but these were very eye-catching to me the ingredients looked very interesting and the one that i'm most excited about is this one this is a this is called cocoa cloud whipped shave butter and it contains vanilla coconut milk argan oil white tea and it has a vitamin e boost i was intrigued by this one because i am always on the lookout for shaving products you know for my legs my underarms i really like the one from tree hut i think it's the brand and they have a shaving oil and that has been my favorite one so i mean obviously this is not going to be the same product this is a shaving butter and the other ones are shaving oil but i am very interested in this i also like that it comes in a glass bottle very luxe and this also comes in a beautiful shaped form it looks a little bit weird right there but that's very very pretty looks pretty and this scent is absolutely delicious that smells very very good i can't wait to put it on my body and try it out and then i also got the coco rose fudge whipped body butter this contains coconut rose shea butter collagen and algae extract boost so this looks very interesting this is also comes in a very very pretty packaging it's so so pretty and you could definitely smell the rose in here that has a strong rose scent so we'll be testing that out as well let me try it a little bit before i put it away this feels also very thick so i think you shouldn't need a lot you know when they are this thick usually a small amount will do it yeah definitely that is thick and i'll probably just have to work that on my skin warm it up a little bit and that should help it absorb a little bit better but yeah it definitely has a rose scent just in case you don't like that keep that in mind and then i also purchased the blueberry cush body oil this contains 300 milligrams of cbd and this helps detoxify and illuminate the skin it also contains aha and bha so you know that's going to help a little bit with exfoliation on your skin and illumination you know we all want that um glowing body so i'm very intrigued in this one this one i probably wear at night since it does have aha and bha so i'll probably wear this one at night with the to help with the exfoliation i'm gonna try here on my hands these definitely feel with an oily consistency and i don't i don't see i'm sorry i don't smell a scent on it either so that's also a plus so yeah i'm also excited for this one and then i also purchased this um body star perfecting cream this is for your body and this targets cellulite stretch marks and dehydrated skin it has a super fruit blend also contains cactus flower neroli i'm not sure that's how you pronounce it i'm sorry and it has prickly pear boost so this one also looks very interesting i'm mostly interested in this because of the of these stretch marks paints so we'll see if that's gonna help with stretch marks on the skin diminish the look of them let me open this okay so i opened it i'm just gonna tell you that this packaging feels very very luxe on these two right here the other one that i got the other one the the hair mask the the cap the lid it's super heavy which i mean that's a plus for them you know that's that's very very good i like that and then let me open it oh it does come with this heel so let me break that seal okay i finally opened it let me see that's a very mild scent this also feels very lightweight very very smoothing so i'm also excited to test this one out and see if it helps with stretch marks hopefully it does i also purchased this blueberry couch body oil it also contains 300 milligrams of cbd and this also helps with detoxifying and illuminating the skin it contains megan collagen cannabis sativa organic coconut also it contains aha and bhas so this should also help a lot with exfoliating the skin and that's going to help you have that illuminating and glory skin so let me see if i could pop this out i'm already moisturized all over my hands with all of these products that i've been putting them on my my skin this one also feels very lightweight and this one definitely has a scent but it's a very pleasant scent i will tell you that yeah it definitely has a berries scent which um i'm all about smelling good and delicious so i'm also very excited to try this one out and then finally i have this one which let me take it out of the packaging first okay i got it out of the packaging now i understand why it came in this plastic container i opened it and all of this just bursted out on me so i'm gonna you know put it on my heels because that's what it's for so give me a second we didn't want to waste any of that okay so now that i did that let me tell you what this item is it's called pineapple haze and this is an extreme repair cbd hand and foot cream it contains 200 milligrams of cbd pineapple and organic mango and you definitely do smell the pineapple in this it does have fragrance i don't want to open it because i'm afraid that it's going to burst out again but i'm very looking forward to this to see if it helps repair my heels and you can also put this this on your hands like it says here so you know i'm gonna be very moisturized for the next weeks so oh i forgot one item which is they scented in this little bagging very cute color pink and it is just a spoon it's so tiny this is so cute look how tiny that is that's very adorable and i purchased this one as well just because when i'm in the shower and i'm to be using this shaving butter um i don't want to dip my hand in there in there because i don't want to be pouring any water in there so i'm going to be using this spoon to scoop out the shaving butter so that is it guys this is everything that i purchased from julie beauty i am very excited to try all of these products out personally i think that it takes approximately four to six weeks for an item to show if it's going to work or not i mean if it starts working earlier that's a big plus and i'm going to be very happy about that but i'll be trying these products um like i said for a whole month and after the month i will come back and i will update you guys on how these products work for me i might even rank them you know from the worst to best if i liked any items which ones i'm gonna be repurchasing if i don't like any items i'll definitely let you know i'm probably gonna do this video in different videos just to show you all and be more detailed about what i liked what i didn't like i'm gonna go more into detail on the ingredients as well i'm not an expert but um i definitely like to do my research i'm in ingredient enthusiast so are probably um update you guys in a video focused on skin care a video focused on the hair care items and a video focused on the body items that i purchased so if you're definitely interested in knowing my final thoughts on these products i highly recommend you to subscribe that way you won't miss those videos and also if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up um that really helps out my channel and that lets me know you know what you guys are liking and um i'm very excited to share all of these items with you guys so i really hope you have a great day and i'll catch you on my next video bye guys", "Zcw1-qLqhHA": "I love it that is love me is [ __ ] counterfeit I get down one right onto another [ __ ] yeah college educated she graduated any field she can't find her parents paid in the shell was born what is up everybody and welcome back we're here today with the third and final nineties nectar review we are going to be doing the CBD sub and the CBD soft gels today so I have been using both I finally got a chance a few times to use the CBD stove also I know I've been pronouncing it wrong now I was saying cell door solved before and it's I believe sev so yeah that's what I'm gonna go with now I will start off with the CBD soft gels these again are 330 pills three hundred milligrams of CBD and they're ten milligrams each you can take one or two so the serving size is one soft gel but then at the bottom it says recommended use take one two soft gels daily as needed they're not vegetarian there's like I said 30 in a bottle there one calorie each calories from fat one cannabidiol ten milligrams the ingredients I'm gonna skip a couple of them because I don't know what they are but there's MCT oil Fido cannabinoid rich hemp oil beta-carotene and gelatin capsule zero THC as are all their products the CBD here is no THC whatsoever this USA grown and I'll read you guys the little paragraph that they have on the back here so it says our final cannabinoid rich hemp oil soft gels are created with our proprietary water-soluble liquid this product is is designed to have maximum absorption and optimum bioavailability contains other minor vital cannabinoids such as CBG CBN CDC and over 40 naturally present terpenes so that's pretty cool and also says door away from heat humidity and light do not refrigerate [Music] CBD is a natural constituent of hemp oil so I'm gonna show you guys the pills I think I have taken a couple out before comes with this little uh one of those little dry pack things in there keep away any moisture so they're nice little kind of clearish slightly golden pills i have taken two at a time all the times that I've tried them I actually had one of my friends try a couple two and he's got you know he's got diabetes so he's got diabetic neuropathy and a couple other ailments as well and he actually said that it really helped with his pain and he kind of felt more relaxed too so I'm kind of trying to get everybody into CBD here um I got my dad taking it I have a mom try it no I'm getting friends into it I mean it can help anybody so I think it's awesome actually I think I'm gonna take a couple of these right now so I just took two out of the bottle and I'm just gonna take so I won't get any real effects a noticeable effects from them just because there's no they're non psychoactive so you're not gonna get that high that you get with THC you're gonna get more of the pain relief or stress relief anti-inflammatory stuff like that that you're gonna feel more in your body as opposed to like the head high or body high next is CBD sev this is a thousand milligrams it's two ounces a thousand milligrams CBD sorry and scent is lavender and eucalyptus so the ingredients on this are non-gmo cold pressed virgin coconut oil organic beeswax vital cannabinoid rich hemp oil lavender oil and eucalyptus oil the suggested use is applied liberally to the affected area if the conditioned process seek assistance from a qualified health care practitioner warning for external use only avoid contact with eyes mucous membranes damaged skin or wounds tamper-evident bottle use only at the seals intact like I said I believe most of their products did come with like that clear plastic seal around the lid so you know that they were sealed it's fully decarboxylated its solvent free pesticide free and GMP compliant and it says our topical delivery system is designed to improve absorption bioavailability and optimization of help health benefits some of the possible benefits of applying hemp oil typically are listed below joint and muscle pain cramping headaches psoriasis eczema and acne so it's really good for a lot of things I actually have kind of like a dry patch on the side of my foot I believe I have plantar fasciitis so I've been wrapping it up a tape my dad has it as well so he kind of showed me how to wrap it up and everything so being wrapped up all the time it's gotten kind of dry so I actually did use some of this and it's pretty I think I put it on there maybe two or three times so far and I feel like it's already probably about 90% better so I'm gonna say I love this stuff already and I do love these I've taken probably five times and I took two each time and every time I felt that kind of like just body relaxation and just kind of felt relaxed mellow more stress-free not completely obviously about more than usual and just kind of some pain relief I would have to stay out of all the products surprisingly the one that I probably thought I would like the least I actually like the best and that would be the tincture I love the peppermint tincture and it works wonders any time I use it I feel completely relaxed and like pretty much all pain is gone so I love nineties nectar I definitely will be ordering from them again probably be getting some soft gels for a couple other people but I love everything so please go check them out I tried recording this video a couple days ago but I didn't check my camera before and I didn't delete any previous videos so it happened to cut out after three minutes which kind of sucked because there's probably a 10-15 minute video so I kind of lost everything and I've been working the last couple days probably 25 hours in the last two days so just now getting a chance to make this so I hope you guys enjoyed and I will be doing another review in the next couple days I forgot to smoke you guys in the last video so I just heated up my banger and turned my timer on we got about 15-20 seconds or so left got me a nice little chunk on here we're gonna go in on this nice little dab of I believe it's our og from Bandito extracts still a little bit hot so we're gonna give it another second or two all right we're good cheers everybody peace", "3o5Au3HyWMQ": "on my way old smoke and falling and falling then turned into rain the rain dried out

review on Blue Ridge hemp companies CBD infused SAP it is awesome so Justin's holding the naan opened package so that you can see what it looks like when it's not been almost all the way roped off because this is our very loved CBD SAP this is actually the very first product that we started carrying inside thrive hip store a vegan wellness because I was a little bit new to CBD and CBD supplementation and I didn't want to start out ingesting anything so if you're anything like me this might be a super great place to start because you do have the endocannabinoid system all over your body it runs just through your skin and guess what is your largest organ ding ding ding it's your skin so this is this is a really great way to try a CBD product and it is great for things like aches and pains that's what we usually use it for but I know my brother-in-law he actually likes to use this when he's got he's got it's that eczema rheumatoid eczema psoriasis and he's got something like that and he likes to use this particular product for his psoriasis when this you know that's dry flaky skin he really sees improvement for that because CBD helps with inflammation and it helps to calm down your nervous system were you about to say something I was just saying my dad uses it because he's got some injuries to his knees in his back and he likes this one specifically because of its he feels like it works better his orbs a little faster there's 200 milligrams of CBD in this 2 ounce container and it last him he uses a little bit couple times a day and I last time about a month I think yeah yeah we've had this one as you can tell it's well loved let me show you please don't judge us because it is well loved is almost all the way gone and when you get it out keep in mind this is a natural product they don't have anything to keep the products from you know separating or anything like that so because it's got cocoa butter in it if it warm cuz we don't you know keep our house super freezing he hates that it sort it can kind of get a little bit melty but this is what it looks like on your finger and you can rub it wherever it hurts like I'm going to put it on my elbows and here lately he's been rubbing on my shoulder because I had I fell around Christmastime kids toys are horrible especially when the low light conditions and so this has been awesome it helps to reduce pain associated with that fall and you know the fact that we are closer to 40 than we are 30 so this one they use mango butter cocoa butter coconut oil as well as often when it gets one arnica is arnica infused olive oil which is awesome for aches and pains yeah it also just helps with aches and pains so has a has a nice scent I enjoy it it has menthol as well in it so it feels a little it gets a little warm after you rub it on your skin just so you'll be aware but I like it it works great and it'll last for quite a while the one thing that you do want to keep in mind with the Blue Ridge hip company CBD and few salve is that it comes in at about $50 and so depending on the different products on the market this is a little bit more expensive however it is a 100% natural product you're using oils you're not using any words that you can't pronounce like on the back it has all of the different products in it and it is all things that you and I can pronounce and they use a lot of essential oils which I love as well and that's what kind of gives it that scent like a rhenium and I'm drawing I'm drawing a blank and lavender and calming things like that so you do pay a little

covering is bbong formulas and my wish is that you have the tools that you need to be able to share these formulas with as many people as possible and positively impact as many lives as possible while making an incredible living for yourself you can search high and low anywhere in the world and you will never find products like we have for you here at Kenway and that is because what we bring to you our v bond formulas combined with CBD bbong formulas are defined as secret formulas these secret formulas have been handed down through my family lineage from generation to generation the bbong formulas are rooted in the teachings of the great doctor hojun who is from korea he's a renowned herbologist who is known to have written one of the greatest medical encyclopedias of all time which is called the domi Volcom this book is actually currently being studied by some of the top medical schools in the world because of the incredible information that he has to share regarding the human mind body and how to have the most optimal condition possible our bbong formulas where once only available to the royal court this is due to the fact that they were so powerful that the royal court didn't want to share them so this is an incredibly special moment because for the first time in the United States and really in the world here at kannaway we are sharing our bbong formulas on a scale that has never been done before so what is it bbong formula you can really break it down into three simple key principles the first principle is a bbong formula first and foremost has to be secret it has to have been handed down from generation to generation through a family lineage number two and one of the most important things that we have to understand is that bbong formulas are proper formulations anyone can take a whole bunch of herbal ingredients and put them into a formula and call it an herbal formula this is not necessarily herbology true or biology is the ability and the knowledge and the wisdom to take those herbs and understand them so completely you know how to take each herb put it into a formula and make it so that is completely balanced so although each herbal ingredient has amazing functions when you put it together that's when the miracle happens a proper formula has the ability to go into each person and because of the knowledge and the wisdom of that formula and every herbal ingredient they're able to go inside and correct all the imbalances in that person when you have balanced it means that everything flows everything functions and that really is the key to anti-aging and optimal health which leads me to the third principle which is it works for every individual's condition regardless of your age regardless of whatever imbalances you may have regardless of the lifestyle you choose to live the significance of a proper herbal formulation is that it is able to rebalance one's Qi and that is the key to anti-aging and optimal health so of all the important points that we went over today about bbong the most important thing to remember is that these formulas work when you hand out these formulas you will see the difference and you will hear all of the amazing testimonies that will come and I promise you they will and I can't wait to hear about him [Music]", "Y-7jik-Xiak": "at andhaka rcvd production is simply certified meaning that

have two bottles one is orange and one is unflavored looks like this you can see it is a 500 milligram bottle and it's 30 milliliters they both go for around 39.99 i believe it was the actual price on their website theirs they also have a cinnamon flavour but i'm only reviewing the orange and the unflavored for right now so in the mail it came with these packages Hedison spit in my travel case so they're kind of jagged right now but come in those little packages and it comes with a little pamphlet telling you more about the CBD i'm gonna start with the natural one the unflavored natural so i check this one before i had a show and i had a little bit of anxiety and it actually went away I took about I think five to ten droppers and I didn't have any anxiety while I was performing that was nice it did not reduce so sometimes I take CBD before I drink so that I don't get a hangover the next day did not reduce the hangover did nothing for the hangover I had a hangover but you know maybe that's because the alcohol I drink or how much I drink who knows oh I also traveled while I was taking this one I took three droppers before I got on the plane and I didn't have an anxiety for my whole flight I also noticed that compared to the fab CBD this which was the same milligram content fab CBD worked a little bit better for me I had to take more go green than I did fab CBD and I usually like to take less if I can so for me personally I'd rather have something more effective but go green is actually very useful because it did get rid of my anxiety so it is still a good choice oh the taste was very very we'd like it wasn't it wasn't as strong as blue birds we'd kind of planned he taste but it still you could still taste the cannabis and yeah it was clearing colors that was nice moving on to the orange go green hemp so this one tasted heavenly it tasted exactly like oranges it was like this is the best tasting CBD that I've ever had if you can't do the whole wheat taste with your CBD I would highly recommend getting the orange one because it's an amazing phenomenal I tried this one for pain I had cramps because it was my time of the month and I took it it didn't really help for my cramps I also used it for oh I also used it for two things that I had and it didn't really diminish any pain or I didn't notice a difference at all but it didn't work for anxiety like the other natural one did so that was nice it does work for you you guys are out there looking for a CDD for your anxiety this one is something I would recommend I also tried this one for it's a hangover thing and it didn't help for the hangover that I had after I drink another night but usually after drinking I get anxiety the next day and I did not give it anxiety I felt a little bit aloof still because after drinking also get like well kind of believe things I had a splash like yeah feel a little funky after drinking I still felt aloof but I didn't have high anxiety after drinking which is wonderful overall I really liked both of these I would definitely opt for the orange because it tastes amazing but if you're into the cannabis taste and maybe try this one too yeah go try it guys I'll leave the links below", "Zo-UuhBoGJc": "what up guys Jimmy here and I'm reapplying this video of me vaping YouTube deleted I guess for some reason I don't know why they didn't give me an explanation but here it is enjoy what up guys James here and today we're talking about vaping let's go so I got into vaping just because I wanted to try it out and it's a really cool hobby this is a smoke X proof it's a great little mod it looks really cool I've got a rebuildable deck atomizer inside the the prince tank this is a TF v12 prince tank check it out I'll do review I'll do all kinds of videos on that but today's video is on CBD so I started trying out CBD oils like contacted hemp pumps and they sent the ton of samples for me to try and to show you and I can tell you right now they are very good they don't have any weird earthy taste these are 75 milligrams but they go up to like four thousand milligrams which is just crazy and it's really cool because they also have gummies and just the plain additives in case you want to you know add to your own eliquid you can do that and they have a few other liked inter drops as well so hep hep bombs it's not just a liquids they have a ton of products definitely check them out in the link below after about two weeks of trying them all are you ready my favourite hemp bombs CBD he liquid flavor is crisp honeydew melon this stuff is very good I'm actually I've been vaping it the most and I'm gonna tell you right now they have a cookie flavor and then the melon is like right here for me like they're both pretty much right back to back and it yeah they vape very well sweet almost has a bubblegum flavor to it and the honeydew actually sticks out very very well and I'm gonna say this like I can vape this all day long I don't have any irritation and it's only 75 milligrams which is kind of low but if it was a higher dose you know because I'm just getting started that might put me to sleep really quick so 75 milligrams this tiny tiny tiny there's no THC there's no weird additives to it it's very good stuff high quality but I will say this the wild berry jam I wasn't a fan of okay kind of tasted kind of weird the watermelon was amazing the Kush what is it called exotic exotic watermelon cush that was incredible the Arctic spearmint blast that's kind of a good flavor but you know once you put it in your cotton it's always gonna taste like that so you really have to dedicate you know one tank to this but it's very very good my second favorite flavor is fresh farm strawberry milk I don't know how they pull it off but they do the milk is like super creamy and that's just a very very good blend so there's there's a ton of options there's you know they have the cookie flavor which I also love and so you know they have dessert flavors fruit flavors and even spearmint so if you have like even a just an interest at all I think hep balms is a great place to start again tin sure's gummies they have a liquid additives so my one of my favorite flavors is cheery cheery hose and so I don't have the additive but I could just put a few drops in here and that would make it you know a great all day solution so definitely check out hemp bombs there's a great coupon code below where you can use my coupon code and if you guys have any questions let me know it kind of just makes me kind of tired a little bit it's kind of a relaxing it's great when I'm watching TV if you had a higher dose that might actually be more beneficial depending on what you you know kind of like what are you what you're doing it for some athletes they do it for muscle relaxation some people do it for sleep and you know instead of doing sleeping medication they can just vape it or do drops I think vaping might be better for sleep because it affects you quicker where's the drops I've heard kind of take longer to absorb into your cells but it's all good it's all really good I mean I think CBD is kind of it's really popular right now for a very very good reason as you can see it vapes are very very well and again Chris probably do mountain is my favorite so definitely check the link below where you can get more information and again if you guys have any questions let me know and also let me know have you tried vaping before because it's very very different than what I thought it would be it's actually pretty fun so thank you guys for watching and have a great day", "3BR_HK3XdNQ": "CONTRIBUTE TO BATTLE THE\nHOMELESSNESS PROBLEM, WE\u2019LL\nTELL YOU WHAT THE CITY\u2019S PLAN HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM,

out all the associates who've signed up and we're spreading the word I've had health problems for pretty much my whole adult life so I know what it's like to be searching for something and not have any relief so if you have any problems with pain sleep depression you need to try the stuff I'm not saying you have to get it for me CBD oil is great you know but if you're gonna get some make sure it's good quality our CBD oil is backed by third-party lab testing so you know what they say is in the bottle is actually in the bottle and same with another thing I'll show you the oil we have this is a the 500 milligram isolate and you can tell by the clarity of the oil a lot of other oils are a lot cloudier so you can kind of see the clarity in that these bottles there are 30 milliliters the dosage that I would suggest is start off low start off both 3 to 5 drops in the morning and 3 to 5 drops at night and then every 2 days up in a drop in the morning and at night and keep going up until you notice relief and everyone notices it a little bit differently most of the people I know right now are kind of around the 8 to 12 drops kind of so when you take the drops I'll take them right now show you what what I do for you take them and put them right under the tongue I let them sit there I shouldn't really be talking as much let it sit there for a bo-best is two minutes they say 30 seconds to a minute but don't drink any water just let it sit there and absorb there's different strengths to these bottles this is the 500 milligram I would say 500 milligrams probably the best place for most people to start so if you start off low and you work your way up on the drops and if you find you're maxing out the recommend dosage on here is 20 drops in the morning and 20 drops at night so if you find you're maxing out then definitely go up a step on the milligrams but this is cheaper so you might not need the 750 or the 1500 so for most people I would suggest the 500 milligrams here's a little chart of how they suggest the milligrams is based on your pain scale here so if you're not too bad 300 milligrams if you're distressing or intense pain you know 500 to get me into the 750 and you're unimaginable unspeakable pain then you're gonna be at the 1,500 milligrams and these balls for how much is in a bottle it says if you're taking 20 drops in the morning and 20 drops at night it'll last 25 days so meet personally I'm at 10 drops in the morning at 10 drops at night so that's gonna last me twice as long 50 days so if you have any other questions about the oils we have the three kinds of oils this is the isolate this is doesn't contain all of the cannabinoids in it so it doesn't have the full healing power but if you have any questions about drug testing or anything that this is the safest way to go none of the oils actually contain THC but some of the other cannabinoids might give false positives but we really haven't heard of anybody testing positive from the stuff but if you're in if you're worried about the isolate is the way to go and then they have the full spectrum and that has all the healing of a little bit better than the isolate for healing powers but it contains all the cannabinoids so you do get traces of other cannabinoids in it and then we have the ten times pure and that is water-soluble so it absorbs into your system a lot better they say ten times is effective so it's a little bit more costly but if the cost isn't as big of an issue to you and you just want effects and benefits go with the ten expirence it's the way to go so I think I've covered everything for this video if you have any other things you would like to see in an upcoming video any questions you'd like me to cover topics post in the comments below if you know anybody that this oil can help please please share my video I appreciate it a lot like it share it help me out help me spread the word of CBD nor any CBD later guys", "RZDjwIyhJbw": "[Music] oh show me what you're doing show me [Music] hey guys so today i decided to have a self-care day i'm going to be doing all the things that make me happy and make me feel good especially since school has started starting to feel the stress that school brings and i'm not going to let that overtake my day or my whole week so i'm going to be doing self-care things that are going to take care of my mental health so let's get started to start this self-care day off i'm going to be working out i've created workout plans and a schedule so i can really get back into working out i used to do small workouts here and there and i always felt energized afterwards and my mood would drastically change especially when i decided to work out in the morning so that's why i really wanted to stick with it and be more consistent and it's gonna be a fun workout because i'm gonna be a hula hooping so that being said let's go outside and work out [Music] it is a gorgeous day so i'm so i'm gonna do this quickly because i feel very uncomfortable being outside just because i can hear my neighbors but i'm going to be um hula hooping for not that long i'm only hooping outside and then the rest of my workout i'll do indoors it's just too hot and there's no shade but i really don't get any sun i'm gonna be hula hooping for 10 minutes five minutes like each side because i saw on tick tock that getting a weighted hula hoop would make you gain abs or i like how it's like a warm up and hopefully over time i will see results with the hulu it is weighted like it's huge that's why i'm doing it outside because i don't want to knock anything over if i hula hoop in my room like i could like knock over a flower plant or like a drawer i don't know but i'm gonna quickly hula hoop i don't know if i'll record the whole thing but i'll record some clips of me hula hooping i think this is like five pounds or at least two pounds so it's not like i'm hula hooping to hula hoop like i feel like you wouldn't get results if your hula hoop was plastic hopefully the lighting isn't too bad literally can't see anything okay i'm just gonna loop now i'm i set a timer i'm gonna set a timer for five minutes it tickles my stomach one it like takes my breath out because it's heavy i think i'm getting bruises on like my waist but i think that just means it's working [Music] jesus okay i'm over this all right so we're back inside i'm so happy i went outside and hula hooped because the day was really pretty but ever since i started hula hooping it has given me a reason to go outside my backyard and all that i've been hula hooping for five days now that's kind of why it hurt while i was hula hooping because the hula loop is pretty heavy or it's something i'm not used to but anyways i'm going to continue my workout i'm just gonna look up some ab workouts on youtube i've really liked doing daisy quiches workouts or alexis friends ab workouts i'm just gonna be doing that quickly okay my workout is done it's time for a nice and lovely bath i'm gonna make it as aesthetic and cozy as possible and then afterwards i'm going to shower to get all like the bath bomb residue off and all that but you'll see what i do hi guys i'm quickly popping in the video and interrupting to show you these self-care items that got sent to me by truly beauty since this video is self-care i decided to show you these extra self-care items this video is in partnership with julie beauty here with me i have the blueberry crush line and i've used these products before filming this video to make sure i like them and everything and it was the most luxurious thing i have ever put on my body so basically what these items are three of them are for your body and one of them is for your face all right time for voice over me i just wanted to go more in depth about these products so here they are up close okay so this is kind of a weird shot i just wanted to show you my legs before using their body oil and their body lotion and just kind of how i use the two prior to this i exfoliated my legs with their body scrub and shaved right after all of their products are vegan high performing meaning they contain vegan collagen and aha bh boost what those ingredients do they basically get deeper into the pores to remove dead skin cells and excess sebum and sebum seep the sebum is basically what creates strawberry legs and all those little bumps on your legs that are like extremely annoying yeah all these products will get rid of that and you'll see my after of my legs in a second there it is and

to say so let's get back to the video [Music] [Applause] please come [Music] today [Music] [Music] i don't know what to say to you i just get so lost all right so i'm out of the shower now i have no makeup on my face is completely clean i wash my face and shower and before i do any of my other skincare i decided to do a face mask but i decided to go with this one and it's the azatek healing clay mask and it's very intense so you kind of have to only use this like i think it's once a month it's the world's most powerful facial mask it says it on the thingy so basically all i'm gonna do is put some of this powder just like a powder texture with some apple cider vinegar so that should smell lovely honestly i'm just eyeballing it and i'm using this to scoop it out supposed to use equal parts but it's fine and i always make too much so hopefully today's the day that i do not it smells disgusting i did it i made too much again okay okay okay here we go [Music] i think i'm done um my nose could use a little more so i've used this face mask a couple times before and i don't like putting it on like my upper lip area because it hardens like really tightly and then i can't even like smile or laugh but i think talk or like if i want to eat a snack i literally can't eat anything because i'm really like uh well i tried i try to make it as pretty as possible while i let this sit i'm going to write in my planner i'm just going to plan out any homework i have due soon and any youtube videos my sponsorships i'm just going to write that all my planner the way i'm going to plan out my day

that you could join us here for another segment we're going to have a health supplier segment have a conversation with Jude bond CEO of canna Phil Kemp infused topicals these joining us on the program to talk about canna Phil's patent-pending blend of organic phyllis oota khals welcome to the program Jude how are you I'm doing great how are you I'm doing well and I'm grateful that you took the time this morning to join us here on health professional radio and tell all our listeners a little bit about yourself and about your company can't fill i sure well thanks Neil well my name is Jude and I'm the CEO of canna Phil as you said I were a small sort of boutique manufacturer of hemp infused topicals right now we're specifically focusing on our signature topical cream but it's a it's a CBD base all-around topical for skin muscles body you know joints and nerves that covers up a lot of area yes literally yes absolutely now let's talk just a bit about CBD what is it about the CBD that makes it so special and why we're hearing so much about CBD well you know please keep in mind meal that I I'm not a health professional per se but CBD is one of the cannabinoids found in the hemp plant most CBD comes from the I guess the industrial version of the plants in which the THC is either stripped out or largely non-existent so it has no CBD has no psychoactive element to it so you can apply it ingested that sort of thing without any any confusion as you will but still get the benefits to the endocannabinoid uptake that you have where it's the way the cannabinoids act on on the I guess brain receptors and nerve receptors in your body where it encourages the production of an endocannabinoid release in response it's really sort of way beyond my lights a pay grade how does it work well when you talked about the topicals being effective on joints for skin for all sorts of things that's all sorts of people being able to benefit from this topical you're the the CEO of this company canna Phil how long has this company been in existence well technically the company can't fill has been in existence for about a year and a half we've been working on this product can my partner and I for well over two years and she the product many years ago for palliative effects and during her mother's final years so the it started off as a palliative measure to help a loved one and sort of expanded beyond that into something that we know we're marketing sort of much more broadly to to the general public which were able to do now since the passage of the 2018 hemp bill which allowed to the production of intense you know industrial lamp and production of CBD to be put into things like topical and whatnot I'm wondering how can it help the joint does it help a joint at the same time that it helps maybe a rash or something that someone has well it want to keep in mind of course the skin is the largest organ and the way that canna filler is designed it's not designed to be a moisturizer it doesn't have menthol in it you know it's it's really been designed to permeate your skin and deliver the strongest CBD that we can on the market we have the most powerful CBD topical cream you'll find on the market and it's really designed to penetrate the skin and get into that tissue area where it can start working and so if you apply it I've used it for everything from carpal tunnel to frankly a skull injury and a back injury a lot of other people I know use it for arthritis and even for you know radiation post radiation treatment when you're talking about potency doesn't strongest type of topical let's compare amounts milligrams things of that nature how would how would one know that if they're getting more CBD in their topical that really goodbye I look for well in when I say ours is the most powerful it's because we have a thousand milligrams of CBD in each ounce jar so in each single ounce there's a thousand milligram a lot of the other ones that you'll see will perhaps have three hundred and thirty milligrams and an ounce or 150 and a half ounce or sometimes you'll see occasionally you'll see a thousand milligrams but if you look at the size of the jar is often two ounces for ounces so when I say the most powerful we really do have the highest concentration of CBD in our our cream per per ounce and we use a very premium organically grown hemp plant that produces a really 97% pure extract and it's because of that that modest impurity which is comprised of other cannabinoids like CVC and CBN which are in fact in their own right beneficial for the body that that's why we attempt extract other work now this extract is it actually the carrier what are you using to to carry this potent sound II that's that's a great question so that's really that comes down to our base ingredients so of course this 97 percent pure distillate when we use a whole plant distillate so that that the entire plant is to create this and we we suspend it in a cream that's been ativ aloe sunflower oil and also a major component of it is elderberry which has its own beneficial purposes as well as it helps with the sort of uptake and bioavailability of the CBD we found we've done a lot of tests over the years with different blends and we found that to be a really helpful component so that's that's the lion's share of what's in there and then there's other things there's an extractive bergamont and lavender some stuff like that but yeah it's it's pretty pretty strong and pretty basic let's wrap with describing your feedback on how it feels once it's apply to nature are we talking a greasy type of feel or is it something that kind of quickly absorbs well it's not at all like it's out over a bomb this is really it's a really light scream but it doesn't it doesn't sit on the skin as you'll see a lot of creams do particularly moisturizing creams and that sort I said it's really been designed to be quickly and deeply absorbed into the skin and the tissue beyond that so it's it you'll find you take a little bit and you rub it in and it disappears and it's in there pretty fast and without any real greasy after after effect well give our listeners a website we can go and learn a lot more about your company about your products and let's just talk briefly about the availability is it available simply online or can we pick it up by other means it is available online at Kenneth Phil calm and that c-a-n-n-a p hy ll calm that is where it's available now we are working on getting retail distribution as well as clearance on Amazon's a lot of these things are

is chris here at cbd review lab and today i'm reviewing lazarus naturals 6 000 milligram cbd oil so lazarus naturals is a very popular cbd company they're based in portland oregon and were founded in 2014 with the mission of making high quality cbd products accessible to anyone regardless of financial circumstances they have an assistance program which offers a lifetime 60 discounts to veterans individuals on long-term disability and low-income households which is pretty freaking cool they offer tinctures capsules topicals coconut oil and pet products their hemp is grown in central oregon using organic sustainable farming practices and they use an ethanol extraction method to produce their cbd oil their oil has a dark golden brown appearance to it with an herbal scent and slightly bitter kind of earthy taste price wise this product runs 108 dollars if you use the coupon code cbd review lab which comes out to .018 cents per milligram of cbd which makes this the cheapest cbd oil i've found to date my dosage for this product has been around 50 milligrams and i usually take it when i get home from work and whenever i take cbd oil i hold it under my tongue for a good minute before swallowing it there are blood vessels and capillaries under our tongues that are able to absorb the cbd and other cannabinoids so this allows some of the cbd to bypass our liver and digestive system and go straight into our bloodstream however like most other cbd oils the effects really kick in within a couple of hours and this product is what i come to expect from a full spectrum cbd oil it's both physically and mentally relaxing and it just makes my body feel good and all of my stresses and anxieties that are kind of running around in my head just melt away so overall i am in love with this product it is very effective and very cheap when you look at the price per milligram so they definitely have my recommendation and if you end up purchasing this product don't forget to use the discount code cbd review lab if you want to save some money so that's my review of lazarus naturals i hope that you enjoyed it and i hope it was helpful if you have any questions about lazarus

to talk to you about the Elixinol 300\nmilligrams citrus twist liposome hemp oil this is a lightly sweetened with\nstevia full-spectrum organic product that actually uses liposomes to help\nfacilitate the CBDs absorption into your system Elixinol is considered a\nseed to store manufacturer and producer of CBD products that means they control\nthe entire process from the time that the little industrial hemp seed goes\ninto the ground until the time that you get it in the mailbox another really\ngreat thing about Elixinol is that they have farms both in the US in\ncolorado and in europe this way the products that we receive in the US are\nmanufactured and grown right here in the US and the products that are shipped and\nreceived in europe are also grown right there in europe Elixinol uses non GMO\nhemp seeds in their products and they produce all of their supplements in a\npharmaceutical grade compounding facility this allows them to be both us\nhemp certified and to pass the cGMP audit standards these sophisticated\nmanufacturing processes and certifications help to ensure that each\ntime you get one of these Elixinol bottles in the mail you're going to have\nthe exact same result every time you take the product so what the heck are\nliposomes and why are they in this bottle of my CBD you may wonder\nliposomes were created in the 60s using nanotechnology and they have been in our\nmedicine since the 80s in a nutshell they are phospholipids that can\nwithstand the gastrointestinal acids and make it past any detoxification that\nyour liver may be contributing basically to help more CBD get into your system I\npurchased the 300 milligrams citrus twist liposome hemp oil from Elixinol \nfor the purposes of this review and I've been using it for a few weeks now each\nbottle is 30 milliliters and if you follow their suggested\ndosing there should be around 60 doses per bottle the liposome CBD oil comes in\ntwo flavors natural and citrus twist it says five sprays is about five\nmilligrams of CBD Elixinol does ship worldwide including the US and\nEurope Canada Japan Australia Puerto Rico and South America let's take\na brief moment to discuss the test results available for the Elixinol\ncitrus twists liposome pimp oil Elixinol doesn't post the specific\nthird-party test however they do post certificate of analysis based on batches\nthe bottle that I received doesn't have a batch number on it so I can only\nassume that the most recent batch information that's on the website is the\none that's relative to this particular product when you look at the certificate\nof analysis the first portion will talk to you a little bit about the product it\ngives you a little bit of the product description what it looks like and the\ningredients once you move further down the page you will find that Elixinol\ndiscloses you get 300 milligrams of CBD and zero THC which frankly was a little\nconfusing to me if this was a full-spectrum product on the certificate\nof analysis and also shows that there are negligible amounts of pesticides and\nheavy metals which makes me feel pretty good about the product that I'm taking\nokay now I want to talk to you about my first experience using this product when\nyou get it in the mail it does have a little bit of cellophane\nwrapping on it and you have to uncover it and then what's also unique about\nthis product is that it comes with a little cap I'll let make sure you can\nsee it that you have to slide off I make it look super easy because I've been\ndoing it for a few weeks now but the first time I kind of had to stare at it\nfor a second and I was trying to pull it off and at first I didn't want to pull\noff that easily I really appreciate this cap though because I have been known to\nspill my precious hemp oil in my purse and this cap helps make sure that\ndoesn't happen here's something else I noticed the Elixinol says this is a\nspray but I kind of feel like it's more of a pump\nbecause the fluid is very viscous it's very thick especially compared to other\nfull-spectrum oils on the market let me show you what it looks like when you put\nit on your finger I'm going to do one little pump you'll notice that it's like\nslightly amber maybe a little yellow and it's very thick it doesn't pour very\nmuch on my finger if I do this exact same thing with their 300 milligram\ntincture for example you'll notice that the tincture is much more liquid it's a\nlittle bit darker and it's very very very thin relative to the liposome hemp\noil let me show you how it works this is the top and you press down on it, Elixinol says that you should probably do five pumps for me I can do five pumps\nduring the day and that kind of helps to take the edge off and it kind of helps\nme keep focused but at night I have to do about ten pumps to really help me\nfall asleep when I take it I get it underneath my tongue and then I start to\npump it first so I have sort of a funny story to share with you for this review\nthe first time I took this product I assumed if it was a spray that it would\nneed to be primed a few times and I didn't want to waste any of my precious\nCBD so I just kind of popped the cap off opened up my mouth and started pumping\nthe thing about it is is I guess I don't have that much feeling underneath my\ntongue because I had no idea that I was spraying or pumping the product until\nliterally my mouth was overflowing with CBD oil thankfully I was taking this\nproduct at night so the fact that I had I have no idea at least 15 pumps maybe\n15 milligrams of CBD the fact that I had it in my system I was able to go to\nsleep and the cool thing is I stayed asleep all night long you may be\nwondering what exactly citrus twist is it is not lemon and it's also not orange\nor grapefruit it's sort of taste to me a little bit like a sweet tart so it's a\nlittle sweet a little bit sour but it also is sweetened with stevia so it has\nthat kind of stevia after flavor so if you're not\nbig fan of that definitely keep that in mind however I don't taste any of the\nmore earthy flavors common in a full spectrum product so I think I can take a\nlittle bit of the stevia aftertaste to cover up that natural flavor let me tell\nyou the things that I absolutely loved about the Elixinol 300 milligrams\ncitrus twist liposome CBD oil I actually really like the fact that it's not very\nearthy flavored I'll take the CBD supplements but I prefer them to not be\nquite so earthy so I really appreciate the fact that it doesn't taste very much\nlike a plant matter I also like the fact that I am getting a little bit more CBD\ninto my system based on the science behind the liposomes which is pretty\ncool this is a relatively lower concentrated product there's only 300\nmilligrams in this bottle and 4-5 sprays you get five milligrams of CBD and\nthat's pretty effective with other products I might be taking as many as 20\nmilligrams of CBD to help get the benefits that I'm looking for in a CBD\nsupplement so I really appreciate the fact that I can take five pumps during\nthe day and do pretty good I have to take ten at night to help me to go to\nsleep but even then that's a pretty low dose all things considered for me to\nhelp me get the benefits of a CBD supplement that I'm looking for the\nthings that you might want to keep in mind about the Elixinol 300\nmilligrams citrus twist liposome hemp oil is the fact that it is sweetened\nwith stevia so if you don't love that flavor you might want to keep that in\nmind because you definitely taste it as you're going for the swallow my parents\nhave been trying to get me to switch to stevia for years and as far as I'm\nconcerned they can have it because I don't like the way it tastes however\nthis doesn't taste very earthy and so I guess you got away the whole earthy\nnatural flavor with that kind of stevia sweet flavor the other thing about this\nproduct is that it does come in right at twice the amount of the similarly\nconcentrated Elixinol 300 milligram tincture that's because of the high\ntechnology required in order to produce this product finally and this is kind of\na smaller complaint, Elixinol post a certificate of analysis it's\nkind of like a summary of the third-party test results that they get\nthat's great and I love the fact that each batch I know I'm getting 300\nmilligrams of CBD in here and no THC but I think it would be really awesome if\nthey were a little more transparent and they showed me how many of the compounds\nare in it like if there's CBG and CBN and how much and I really would\nappreciate if they would be a little more transparent in that department\nthank you so much for taking the time to watch this review my name is

"so what i'm going to start doing right now is removing all my makeup and doing my skincare routine so first off we have the removal of all the fancy stuff earrings eye makeup makeup any kind of makeup and i start off with using the artistry makeup remover wipes they are fantastic i love them they are part of my new skincare regime and i love them because they actually remove the toughest makeup i don't wear a whole lot of makeup i don't do it very well but when it's a long day and i just want to get rid of it this is the first step i do it smells super delicious um and i start off with my lips i don't always put a lot on my lips but today was the night today was a night okay tonight was a night and i don't have the liquid makeup remover from artistry they are currently out of stock it's impossible to get it so i just use wipes takes a little bit more effort but it's good and after i'm done looking like a zombie um i just go for my eyeshadow and then on my forehead all around basically and it takes me about like a minute two minutes to take it all off and that is the first step of doing it i've done it for a couple of weeks now and i've noticed that the double cleansing method really helps me a lot okay and now we have the second one which is the glow boss cleanser and exfoliator i mentioned in my first video that exfoliating your skin or overdoing it can tend to dryness and really take a toll on your skin but this is a game changer because it actually has the bamboo exfoliating grains which is gentle enough to use daily i use it in the morning and night and i've noticed a big difference in my skin i feel like it's a lot more just glowier and softer and i just i really love it and the third step is everyday i'm bubbling mask now contrary to the title i don't use this every day i use it when i feel like my skin needs a little extra pampering and mostly in the night time now they do have two aromas which is the lavender and the rose which is personally my favorite i love it they come three in a pack and it's just so good and refreshing for your skin it does tend to come with a lot of product so what i do is i squeeze out the extra juice and apply it on my neck set the timer for 10 minutes and you end up looking like jason from halloween but what are you going to do about it you just kind of have fun with it and the trick is to apply your mask on and once you do use your fingertips to kind of rub in the product take those great instagram pictures because why not and you end up looking like a cloud and just enjoy it right and once the timer is up you just rinse it off with lukewarm water uh feel free to use any type of temperature water but i think lukewarm just keeps the pores open and ready for the next product and you end up looking like that so you know that's just what it is and it's it's super good for your skin super hydrating and you feel like a million bucks next up we have the rose all day toner and this has salicylic acid which is super good i feel like ever since i started using this my skin has severely gone down in breakouts and inflammation and i love the smell super clean smells like roses it's my favorite thing to do in the night time and it's magic ever have one of those nights where you just don't get enough sleep well dc puffing patches are magic because you just pop them on in the morning while you're getting ready for work for meetings whatever and they are working their magic you leave them on for five to ten minutes i usually just brush my teeth while they're doing their thing and the leftover serum as you take them off you just pat it in with your ring finger around your eyes and you don't look like a zombie congrats next in line we have the vitamin c hyaluronic acid there is so many benefits from this and it isn't necessarily part of the new line but it is a must in my skin care what you see here is the dropper i get about four to five drops and apply it on my chin my cheeks nose and my forehead and even my neck it helps a lot with my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars when i had really really bad breakouts it kind of left just the damage and the vitamin c helps diminish all that appearance and it actually helps my skin look a lot more plump i've noticed it just has so many benefits honestly and it is a must it is a staple and my skin care recommend anybody to try it [Music] ah okay the spot on blemish dots so these are essentially stickers infused with tea tree oil i put them on any active acne spots and overnight you see that they go down a lot in inflammation and the redness and they're really fun they come in a lot of shapes and lastly we have the artistry hydro primer two in one light moisturizer and the primer in the morning i put it on right before i'm going to put on my makeup helps the makeup stay on longer and in the nighttime helps you just have refreshed and hydrated skin it's amazing i love it that it's such light material and it smells so good and yeah that's essentially my nighttime skin routine i hope you guys liked it and see you later oh wait i forgot there's one more thing because i'm obsessed with rose stuff this is the rose water and glycerin i spritz it on my face as the very very last step just because i'm obsessed with the smell and then i just say goodnight to the world see you later sayonara and that is definitely my skincare routine bye you", "nNDtn0H4878": "I am sorry there is nothing left to", "S9A13h5XVOM": "How to use CBD hemp oil drops.

you everything you need to know about cbd we'll tell you what it is who should use it why how much to take where to get it and cover the different products available be sure to hit that like and subscribe button if you find this information useful and would like to know more links to any products shown in this video can be found in the description below now let's get to it what is cbd both hemp and marijuana come from the same plant species cannabis sativa but they vary in thc composition cannabis plant has over 100 chemical compounds called cannabinoids the two main cannabinoids are thc and cbd thc is the chemical that gives a euphoric feeling to the user this would get you high cbd is non-psychoactive and has helped with many health conditions including back pain osteoarthritis epilepsy anxiety and more cbd provides many of the medicinal benefits derived from the cannabis plant without getting you high how can it help back pain cbd is generally a full body treatment for pain relief but topical products can target specific areas what are the side effects cbd has generally mild side effects they include mental confusion nausea vomiting diarrhea dry mouth low blood pressure tiredness and a change in appetite while side effects are minimal as with other natural products there is potential for adverse reactions people taking other medication are most likely to experience side effects due to the interaction between cbd and the drug they're taking who shouldn't take cbd if you are taking other medications speak to your doctor first before taking cbd they can advise you of any adverse reactions you may experience based on their knowledge of your medical history pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid cbd not enough studies of cbd have been conducted in this group to determine if it's safe or not for them to use until then it's best to be safe and avoid using cbd like with pregnant women not enough studies have been performed on the safety of cbd and children one notable exception here is in the cases of pediatric epilepsy both the fda-approved drug epidoliacs which contain cbd and other forms of medical cbd have been shown to help treat severe epilepsy if you want to give cbd to your child it's best to speak first with your pediatrician to ensure it will be safe for them to use what about pets because mammals like cats dogs and horses all have similar endocannabinoid system functions cbd for pets can provide some of the same useful applications for those looking for an alternative cbd may support a more wholesome wellness regimen dosage how much do we take most cbd oil products will have a number on the front of the bottle often ranging from 300 milligrams to 10 000 milligrams this number is not the amount of cbd oil you will get in every tincture dropper or capsule but instead is the total amount of cbd contained within the cbd oil product how much cbd oil to take will vary from person to person the right cbd dose for you can depend on a few factors including your weight any other health conditions you may have and medication that you're taking for those conditions it also depends on your personal body chemistry and sensitivity to cbd when determining your ideal cbd dosage your goal is to find the lowest dose that provides the benefits you will need with few or no side effects the standard recommendations base your cbd dose on your body weight take one to six milligrams per 10 pounds of body weight these are just general guidelines some will need more of taking cbd for chronic pain and others will need less if taking for situational anxiety since side effects are minimal it's important to see what dosage works best for you there are so many different products how do i choose oils oils can be taken orally vaped or mixed with drinks oil is used in other cbd products like creams but it can also be used alone capsules are also available which are better for accurate doses tinctures tinctures are made by soaking cannabis flowers into alcohol for long periods of time to extract the cbd tinctures are sold in bottles with droppers to be used in drinks or taken orally by squeezing a few drops under your tongue edibles mixing cbd oil or tinctures with food and drinks are called edibles you'll find baked goods gummies and chocolates creams and gels cbd creams and gels are absorbed by the skin this helps target specific areas such as back pain they have been shown to reduce inflammation and neuropathic pain as well what's the best way to take cbd if you don't want to ingest anything or if you want to target a specific area you may prefer topical creams and gels this is what we like best for back pain it can relieve pain where applied in a few minutes and lasts several hours topical creams and gels may require higher dosage to ensure it penetrates the epidermis bait pens deliver the dosage fast in a few minutes but it also wears off fast usually two hours pinchers are a bit slower taking about 20 minutes and lasts a similar amount of time as vape pens edibles are a nice treat but take longer to take effect about 30 to 90 minutes but it can last four or five hours where do you find quality cbd products how do i know that i'm getting the good stuff if you're using cbd you'll want to be sure to have quality products many online products have been tested only to find lower levels of cbd in them than stated on the label look for products that have been tested by a third party testing results should be clear and easy to understand it's simply best to avoid cbd sellers many found on social media and even on amazon that don't provide lab results we simply don't know its quality you should be able to see the lab results to let you know that you are getting a high quality product and that the label is accurate cbd products aren't regulated by the fda so it's important to read the labels carefully and discuss any concerns with a health care provider you can purchase cbd products and specialty shops or dispensaries or buy online direct from the company most brick-and-mortar retailers will have legitimate products however shopping online allows you to compare a wider variety of companies and know exactly what you're getting it's because of all these reasons that we like cbdmd it is one of the most reputable cbd companies in the usa and you can look up the certificate of analysis or the lab results of their products on their website to conclude we think cbd creams and lotions are best for back pain they can be applied topically and target exactly where you're feeling pain other cbd products don't provide the targeted pain relief or provide overall body treatment and relief which many prefer you may prefer to use other products when it is more convenient for example using a vape pen offers quick results in a few puffs and tinctures can be added to drinks or dropped directly under the tongue whichever product you use be sure it's from a reputable dealer like cbdmd and can provide third-party lab results to ensure you are getting a quality product all cbd products can provide relief and the minor side effects make cbd a great

spectrum kind of formulation because it doesn't have any trace it doesn't have any THC in it so you don't don't worry about that and also what's in it is it's got some essential oils you know it's

that aromatherapy going once you apply it under your skin really relaxing then you also get the benefits of phyto cannabinoids from the hemp plant you know such as the CBD the the CBD v the cbn you know the varying cannabinoids without any THC of course guys it's I do want to keep pointing that out so koi a healing balm I'm going to use the big bad boy today because I just love the packaging guys like look at this right on the cap you know it's a wood engraved cap it has the koi logo right koi CBD logo right on it's just it's beautiful alright and you know just high-quality packaging a nice glass container with a nice wood lid you know it's it's solid all the way so you just open this up and ooh ooh so oh its shape so take it out the box so I actually had one out of the box already so you take that like so boom boom and what's really awesome you know it's got some the ingredients on there directions for use you know simply you just using a CBD topical or CBD salve this is what it's referred to as this is a salve does it's thicker consistency it's not like a lotion it's kind of like sort of like a Vaseline kind of consistency but it doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy for extended periods like Vaseline you know so it's really easy with SABS you simply just take take a glob on your finger I mean just rub it right on the plump the problematic area you know it's really effective for those large deep muscle groups that you've really got a massage deep so though you athletes if you experience an injury you know I was dealing with some shoulder pain a while back and reach for the coy healing balm and let me tell you it was really really effective for me so I'm excited to review this product with you guys so pop it out the box right here you know it's got the 500 milligrams of coy healing balm we're sort of sticker right there other than that you know down at the bottom it's got directions for use on it also the ingredients which is a win-win the only thing that I don't see on here that I would recommend for coy I mean I checked the COAS they're spot on there they're great but the only thing I would suggest for coy I'm not seeing it's just because they have it on all their other products is just adding a QR code right under the packaging just so you guys as the consumers can quickly scan it with your cameras on your phone and then you can just verify because it is important that you always verify but let's be honest guys when you're buying from a company like coy CBD quality is of the utmost importance when they're in their manufacturing process to see simply do not have to worry about it so let's go ahead and give the coy healing bummer ago ooh you know I could smell that eucalyptus the lat or the the peppermint oil in there ooh and then the lavender you know I feel like I could smell it is it like some lemon I feel like I could smell a little bit of a oh there is lemongrass oil I was getting a little hits hints of lemon in there ooh there's even some cinnamon leaf oil in there which you know I think would be great for you know kind of like a sort of warming kind of tingling sensation because let's go ahead let's let's actually stop smelling it and actually try it for ourselves so I boom so as you could see guys just a thick little ol glob like that I mean depending on your large muscle groups you can you can adjust it so just like with all SAVs and CBD topicals when you apply it to that local area it'll only provide the localized relief so I recommend pairing I call it the two prong approach I recommend pairing a topical for really outside your body in those localized areas and then also using a CBD t-shirt such as the Wella C full spectrum MCT oil tincture so then you get relief outside with the topical and then inside your body which is the whole body relief using leveraging a topical soul all right so let's go ahead and I'm actually just going to I'm gonna rub this right on my I'm gonna do it on my elbow and also my shoulder so you guys can see so as you can see I'm rubbing it on ooh right when you start putting it on that ooh those essential oils really start to go to work mmm it smells incredible I mean you know just those aromatherapy benefits just from those essential oils like I'm relaxed already guys um you know I could this should be phenomenal to put on you know right before bed you know I mean that's not to say you could use this all during the day because you're not going to smell nasty like bengay it's just gonna be really refreshing and actually so I rubbed it in um and yes so I mean my skin is a little greasy but it's nothing like Vaseline but I mean I just rub I rubbed it in a lot you know you really want to get it in there lather it in there but man it made my skin so incredibly soft and I always get this wow this is really noticeable with the koi CBD healing balm the koi naturals Wow so right when I start rubbing it on I always get sort of like a tingling sensation like I feel like that's the phyto cannabinoids you know the CBD and other cannabinoids that are present in this formulation are really going to work and stimulating my endocannabinoids receptors because we do have them on the skin and that's why CVD topicals are becoming so so popular is because you got a local you've got a specific area of pain that you want to really you to relieve you just rub a the koi CBD healing balm right on it and wow I feel the tingling and like even my hand like you know I can feel it like it's kind of low greasy but honestly like I just rub it in my hand so there's no waste and my hand like I can feel it but it's definitely absorbing rather quickly like I don't see this like I wouldn't have a difficult time grasping things you know writing on stuff so if you're at work and you have some pain that's like some inflammation that's quickly that's a you just pull this out of your your desk you know that keeping the full-size one of your desk or even the travel size in your purse or your a backpack and then you just pull it out whenever you need to relief and wow that that is really really good it smells very refreshing which I I'm a huge fan of this smell don't get wrong it's not you know a lot of topicals out there you know with the especially the lavender you know I feel like they smell a little more on the feminine side of things but you know this this the lavender the ooh the lemongrass you can get that absolutely phenomenal smell so the effects that I'm experiencing so what you know my elbows been kind of bothering me you know I don't have like tennis elbow or anything but you know I kind of fell on it and so but it's actually you know the level of you know I was just kind of kind of hurt a little bit when I was moving it it was just kind of stiff but you know it's really moving I mean it feels like it's loosing it loosening up a little bit um you know the CBD will really start to it takes a little bit P absorbed I mean it does go into work right away um but if you're experienced a high level of pain you know I would definitely give it about 20 to 30 minutes I'm once you put it on to just have really gauge the effects to see if that's right for you but scent I you know I got to give this smell a 10 out of 10 it's very refreshing you know so like I said you know that peppermint oil so it really so once you apply it on you know it immediately starts going to work you know it's kind of like it's sort of like a warming sensation but it's not like you know it's not as crazy as icy hot at all it's very it's very very mild but I do feel the relief taking place and you know I'm actually going to do is a little bit of shoulder pain and this is always my issue especially back pain the shoulder and back pain because I work on a computer all day on there for at least 18 hours a day so my muscles are really tight and stiff and oh my goodness like my neck especially that oh yeah I'm gonna put a little bit more on my neck and oh yeah see guys that I already feel it starting to really sort of alleviate some of the pain and stiffness in my neck up because guys if you can feel my neck you know there's a whole bunch of knots and everything so I would love nothing more than to get a full sort of massage leveraging this koi natural CBD healing balm ooh I keep saying that it smells really good but it's super refreshing relaxing guys like once I put it on I just feel relaxed and also those essential oils or leveraging that aromatherapy so when you're inhaling that you're getting that aromatherapy and then the CBD and the other phyto cannabinoids and the formulation are also going to work you know fighting off that inflammation and another thing you know even if you don't have specific pain you can also leverage this healing balm as a moisturizer because I didn't touch on that my skin is very very soft and you know I have an issue on my neck and my back or my neck and right behind my ears get really really dry I don't know if you can see the redness but I think oh wow that yeah that healing bump I would apply to every where I mean I it says I would not recommend putting it on your face necessarily David say that right on the packaging just to avoid your face and eyes you know because if you can get that there's essential oils and stuff that are in the formulation into your eyes I could you know kind of burn but you know it does it really that cooling sensation janeshia lee is really really good and it's kind of like a cooling warming sensation it's kind of like a little bit of both you know I really did notice that once I put it on my neck you know I it's yeah definite I feel it moisturizing because my neck was so dry incredible moisturizer you know I'm loving the effects that I'm feeling initially now I got it I got a wait a little bit you know to fully gages so I'll probably come back and let you guys know and about you know twenty to thirty minutes to see how I'm feeling and then yeah we can touch base on that because I do want to always touch on the effects you know granite they're all gonna be different from what you and I experience but I think it's important for the sake of this review that I give you sort of some insight on the effects that I'm experiencing leveraging the koi healing balm what's up guys so you know it's about been about 20 or so minutes since I first applied on the koi healing balm so I played it on my shoulder and also my arm and then also my neck because I had that muscle stiffness you know and also some stiffness in my elbow um and also what I wanted to test is um I experienced some some dry skin behind sort of like my ears or upper neck area and let me tell you it took away the dryness I mean my skin feels incredibly soft and also let me touch on that in regards to how it feels um the greasiness that you kind of felt initially that i discussed when i first put it on it's completely gone my skin is just looking healthy supple and just very very smooth looks very shiny smells good still on those essential oils that i listed off are still kicking and strong but yeah i was really kind of worried because i've experienced that way stabs where there's an overly greasy miss with it after an extended period of time and i simply don't like that because you know especially if you're at work and you got to play that on you got crap all over your hands and i hate you know wiping it on stuff because that's just a waste of the CBD so as you saw with the what I do with the koi CBD healing balm is rubbed on the elbow then rubbed it on my arms my neck and then also the any excess and just rub it into my hands and my hands don't feel greasy they're just incredibly soft and smooth so nicely done on that so I did what kind of want to um you know come back pause the video and come back and let you guys know sort of how the effects the effects that I was experiencing you know but about 20 minutes or so in so very very solid on that core I'm super impressed they definitely eliminated my concern with it being overly greasy but also like this stiffness in my neck you know it's still sword it's not like CBD isn't a miracle you know but it is in a sense but for me you know the pain is still there but the soreness and the overall like stiffness has really been subsided so I just feel like I have greater range of movement in my neck and it doesn't really hurt I don't feel like I just have like massive knots in my neck so nicely done and you know I'm definitely going to be reaching for this coin natural CBD healing balm the next time I have a migraine you know rub it right on my neck area and then about like my upper neck right at the bottom of my sort of head and then also leverage our tincture and I really think that would be a match made in heaven you know that's just one of the uses that you can use for the koi Naturals CBD healing balm flavor or scale of 1 to 10 that I would give it just based off the smell alone 10 out of 10 no doubt about it and then the effects that I'm experiencing you know my neck I feel like my neck is the one problematic area in my back that I feel the inflammation really kind of being subsided a little bit you know the pain still there but it's definitely it's providing me a level of relief that I would be happy with um especially if you're at work or something where any level of pain you know if you can mitigate that any even just a minut amount I think that's a win-win especially if you're in a work environment school environment where that can really kind of deter your focus so you know on the overall effects and I'm feeling you know sort of the well the skin sort of nourishing benefits that I got one just based off the softness my skin feel because it's been on my arm for you know about 20 minutes now to 2025 minutes my hands they just feel really soft smell great but they're not greasy at all you can pick something up and also my skin it's not greasy but I will say it's very very shiny and it's very very moisturized so that's great um you know being out here in Colorado it's a very dry climate so if you live out in a dry climate as well such as Colorado not in Arizona or something this would be very good just for the moisturizing benefits but the pain relief and the overall benefit and experience that I get rating it on a scale of one to ten I got to give that an eight out of ten this is by far one of my all-time favorite CBD topical as well and this in this instance a CBD salve it is my favorite one absolutely you know very solid score the packaging is beautiful I mean cool you guys knocked it out of the park on this one everything you need you know is right on the box the only thing that are the label two blocks beautiful packaging even more beautiful but you know the only thing I'd suggest is adding a QR code just to make it super easy for customers such as you guys to access those COAS because in this industry especially with things that are going around there's a lot of negativity so it's very important that you verify where you're getting your CBD and where that source from as well so guys

thank you all for tuning in and watching me today later guys [Music]", "zCAmYuekZjc": "first step is rolling the towel like this into a little taquito and wet it and then wring it out if you don't have a hot towel caddy you can use a crock-pot if you don't have a crock-pot then you could just put this in the microwave for less than a minute and then check the temp and go from there i was able to fit nine little towelettes in there i'm gonna try to put a tenth one and squish it down as much as i can and then one at the very top leave it on high for about 30 minutes and then after that you can move it too low the next thing you will need is a cbd infused body scrub and acbd-infused body lotion i chose truly because it's vegan it's cruelty free it has 300 milligrams of cbd in it and the 1000 blueberries that are in it helps with the blue light damage from all their devices it does have a blueberry smell to it which if my clients don't want anything too strong then i always have a second option for them this is another body polish that i have and it is infused with moonshine there's no cbd in it but this is just the second option that i have for my clients once you exfoliate the feet you're gonna want a lotion that you can use to keep their feet hydrated and nice and soft first step first use some hem soap to wash your hands if your client does not like scented products then you could always get your own unscented foot scrub but since this one since my client does not mind we're going to use a blueberry kush cbd infused body scrub if not you can get your unscented infused with moonshine body scrub and you could add a couple drops of 500 milligrams of cbd oil now we're gonna get started so you won't get anything dirty get a towel underneath your client or your partner get a towel and roll it as thick as you can make sure their foot is clean to make sure your hands are clean and then we can begin is that comfortable so you grab a generous amount of your cbd infused body scrub then you apply it at the top and you apply it at the bottom you start from the ankles just massaging is the pressure okay you're gonna work your way down and give a good scrub down here you could even start massaging the foot for a little bit depending on how much time you have if you're at home your time is probably not limited but if you're at work i hope that they have that they got a 90 minute massage so that you have enough time to scrub their foot really nice try not to get in between the toes but you can also massage the toes if they're not ticklish the thing about this body scrub that i can tell you already is that it stays together so there's no mess on the bottom which is which is good so if you're not in your tub and you don't want to make a mess you can use this body scrub anywhere because it doesn't doesn't make a mess which is really nice so now with your dirty hands if you're at work you will be wearing gloves you remove them you open the towel caddy and you grab your first towel it's really hot let me see if you can see the steam let the steam out for a little bit and then this is too hot you place it under depending on how long your towel is then you hold it down and you get your other towel let the steam come out and then you place it over let me know if it's too long because our hands could take more heat than other people's body so then you just start compressing while you hear that thumbs up two thumbs up you just start compressing and while i'm compressing i'm going to be wiping my hands without the client knowing after that you just do a big big wipe depending on how many towels you have and then you just get another warm towel hot towel and you just start wiping very quickly you just start wiping but once it warms up a little you can wipe as slow as you want make sure to get in between the toes just in case some got in there too rough oh i'm sorry okay then just make sure that your hands are clean just have a little bit then you get your cbd lotion or oil and you give them a nice massage [Music] [Music] then we're going to move on to the next foot at this point if there's anything any like thing that fell you just wanna give them a clean little space and set their foot down and then you repeat on the other side [Music] [Music] you could even incorporate some stretches after you go forward back relax and then rotate whatever you want whatever your client asks for whatever your client desires they shall receive too much so and that ladies and gentlemen is how you give a cbd foot scrub now if there's any other [Music] body services that you would like for me to do then let me know thank you for watching until next time a great benefit of you doing this scrub without gloves is that you exfoliate your hands and they're so soft and moisturized after", "EAvCrE8uHLU": "hey there so today i wanted to show you a product that i've been using for a very long time now um it's a cbd facial serum and if any of you know me and you know probably that i work at equilibria which is a cbd company we have so many wonderful products topical products things you can ingest but at this exact moment we do not have a facial serum yet so that made me have to kind of navigate like where i could get cbd facial products and i ended up on the bibo website it's spelled b-e-b-o-e um so i wanted to show you what i have so this is the bibo cbd facial serum in this beautiful box i know it's really silly but i've kept it in this box for like a year even though i use it every day i still keep it in here just because it's beautiful it's super pretty and i like that it has some like hippie stuff on the side it says uh we do our best to maintain the full spectrum of this plant's magic and it says stuff like that on the side so it's just like oh what a nice vibe um but i do love this and i use it daily so i want to show you it has 300 milligrams of full spectrum hemp oil which is what you want you want full spectrum because that means the full range of beneficial properties from the hemp or cannabis plant so this is what it looks like again it's such a beautiful bottle super gorgeous design but this stuff is very very good because it's good for reducing inflammation helping with fine lines and wrinkles and i can definitely say since i've been using this like i know you know it's hard for you to see like results from my face but i know my face well so whenever it's like changing i can see that and for me it really helps with the fine lines around my eyes that's the main thing um but it's very good too in general just for any sort of inflammation purposes like um like for example when i get really embarrassed my cheeks will flush and they will stay red like all day long if i don't do something they're just very sensitive and it's almost like a rosacea kind of thing so this is where this is very helpful for me it helps calm that down and just not make my skin so sensitive so i wanted to show you this it has 13 phytonutrients in it besides cbd and look at this color look how beautiful so anyone that has had a call with me for equilibria we talk about how one of the ways to tell if it's a good cbd product is the color you want it to be a beautiful golden color like this because if it's clear it usually means there was some process involved to remove that color for some reason you know so you want it to be a nice golden color and this one is very beautiful like i i am a nerd about the color but like this is a very very good one so i feel good about that um i also like that it's full spectrum that's important and it smells very good like that is one of the things that's hard to describe about this but it has a lavender note to it but also some planty undertones that remind me of like cannabis when it's growing it's just a very slight planty smell to it but i like it so the directions say apply six to seven drops to your face after cleansing you can use as needed um i have somewhat combination skin and honestly i'm not the best girl when it comes to like facial products and knowing what i should use and like just navigating that whole land can be really like overwhelming so i just stick to very simple stuff like face wash and you know some serums here and there but i don't i don't go overboard so for me this is the one product that i use daily um and i just use like two or three drops and um it's important that when you do use it i'll show you how i use it here i put a little bit into my hand here i'm just gonna put three drops um but this is the way i apply it i don't know if this is the preferred way but i've i've heard that look how pretty and yellow that is you wanted that color um so i've heard that when you use oil like facial oil you should try to press it into your skin rather than just like rubbing it and being like really frictiony it should be more of a gentle pressing to get the oil to the places you want so i do that i like to like you know smooth it on my skin here and it smells so good it's amazing so i love the smell of it i put some on especially on my cheeks where they get red and then i'll just put the rest in my hair just to kind of help with frizz it's a really good thing but yeah i super love this product and i hope that we start to see more cbd things out in the beauty world like at sephora i know they're having a lot of products lately that have cbd in it but it'd be really great to just see how this can expand and what products would make sense um you know i'm not a huge fan of some things with cbd like some things it's not necessary like there's no point really in my opinion to have like cbd mascara because it's like well you know it's not that irritating to begin with so it's kind of silly um just kind of makes an expensive product but this like cbd on your face there is some science to that like there is very much studies that show it has antimicrobial properties anti-fungal properties anti-inflammation so for all of those reasons that's why i use the cbd oil on my face but again this is the bibo cbd facial serum very good you can check it out on their website which is bibotherapies.com all right well hope you're having a good day i just wanted to show you that if you have any questions or want to talk more about this feel free to reach out to me on instagram you can send me a dm or you can email me cannabiscoachhaley cannabiscoachhalee gmail alright hope you have a good day bye", "huN7YVXyzuw": "R RIGHT UNDER THIRTY DOLLARS.

arm um it feels really moisturizing from the body scrub that i usually use they're like not really moisturizing they're more like you're just rubbing sugar on you know this feels super moisturizing i feel like they're kind it's kind of together that makes sense um so this is it smells super super super super good i'm not really a big fan of blueberry but this honestly really does smell really good you are supposed to use this in the shower so i'm probably not going to get around like really the same results as you would in the shower um but it is really moisturizing and it makes your skin really really soft this and i will give this a 10 out of 10. if you would like to purchase this i will have the links to everything in the description box and i don't have any other information that you guys need to know in the description box as well next thing that i have is this blueberry kush cbd face oil detoxifying illuminates it is a hundred thousand blueberries vegan collagen aha and bha booth same thing as the other one it is harsh chemical free which is really good because i have really sensitive skin so this will not break me out as you can see i do have makeup on right now so i'm not going to be testing this out on my face but it does work really good and it really does um make a difference in my skin and does illuminate it it does hydrate it i do have really dry skin especially since the fall season is coming up it is perfect for that i usually you could put it on before your makeup um i put it on at night before i go to bed before my moisturizer you can also put it on before your makeup or you could just put it on before your sunscreen this has really really light fragrance so it's really good for sensitive skin and i really do love it and the dropper is really nice you could put around like three to four drops or three to five drops on your face nightly and or daily um twice a day and this bottle lasts you a super long time as you can see i saw quite a bit left um this one is also a really really good size packaging and i definitely do give this a really high rating i will give it um a 8 out of 10. i really do love how it goes on my skin and i do like how moisturizing it is next is something i really really love and it is like the baby it's the mom but this is the blueberry because your body oil it also detoxifies and illuminates and it's the same thing as the other ones it is super big and it has a um it has a dropper and let me just my chest i can't really tell but it it does feel um a lot it doesn't clog your pores or anything it does feel a lot more more moisturized than before you can put this on your legs i personally love putting this on my legs after you shave your legs or you put on your arms you can put it on your body wherever you want but honestly this is really good it also does not really have a fragrance to it you put it on at night and in the morning time i personally just like putting it on at nighttime instead of the morning time because um i feel like when i put it on at the night time on my body i feel like i'm moisturized for the day unless i'm gonna wear shorts or like a short sleeve shirt then maybe i'll moisturize in the morning but i usually just moisturize at night um when it comes to that stuff because i don't want to over moisturize because i don't want my skin i have a kind of combo skin and i'm usually good with just moisturizing at night but that is just me but you can use this whenever i definitely give this a high rating as well i give this a 9 out of 10. i really do love it and i definitely recommend this last but not least in this blueberry collection and i have two other things to show you guys but this is the blueberry kush dvd body lotion and it's the same thing as the other ones and i look at this color like it is so pretty this color is to die for it smells like candy it smells so good so it comes in this bottle super good so i'm just going to put this on my arm you just squeeze it onto your arm and you rub it in the super moisturizing a little goes a super super long way you can even see i'm like it's like really illuminating it smells super super good it's not super overwhelming blueberry scent because personally i don't really like it but you do smell really sweet and it's but it is really subtle so if you're like not really a big fan of scents as you can see this one compared to this one you see the difference and i'm putting them in the same lighting as well this is super moisturized because it also helps it has no strong ingredients like i said i have sensitive skin and i have yet to break out from any of these products and i've been using them for weeks now so i definitely do recommend this um and i do definitely think that you guys will love this even if you don't really like blueberry scents or if you do like blueberry scents you'll even love this even more next i have this is one of my favorite things i use this all the time it gets rid of your dead skin like crazy um and this is the jelly lip plumping mask this is the heartbreaker one and it is super minty it looks like this and it's like jelly and it looks so pretty and i love putting this on my lips at night i just wipe it off and then i follow up with the next product this is definitely one of my favorite things and i love love love this because it's hard finding things for my lips because especially now since my lips are getting super super dry i have to take care of them more and pay attention to them more than before because it is full oh because it is fall time and winter time is coming up and my lips get super dry my skin gets super dry so you know i have to take extra care of them but this works really really good it does pump your lips out a lot you could feel it as it's going on it hurts a little bit just because it is plumping so it is gonna like you're gonna feel the pumping sensation but it doesn't like hurt super bad like you're not gonna be an excruciating pain or anything it's like very light you just know it's doing something and it makes you look really like it makes it look really juicy and red um and i love how it has little hearts on it you're gonna have little hearts on your lips and you wipe it away and it's super super good i definitely love this um i do have lipstick on right now so i'm not gonna try it on but it does take my word for it i've been using this i use it maybe once or twice a week um just because i kind of forget i probably would use it more but i usually more remember to use it when i'm going to go out and all my lips will be super dry even though we do our masks now um but yeah so this is super good and i definitely do recommend this is a unicorn fruit lip plumping bomb it is has peppermint matcha and acai boost in it which is my favorite i love these things and also the heartbreaker the plumping lip mask has aloe and vitamin e and i love those i love the ingredients in here also benefiting you so this has a matcha peppermint and acai boost which i think is really really great and this is called the unicorn fruit lip balm i've been using this a lot you could literally see my mark in there there you go so you can see my mark in there it used to be like a little swirl the colors are super super pretty and it works super good i love this lip balm it's definitely one of my favorites oh no the lighting is so very messed up it is definitely one of my favorites and i do definitely recommend this um it is super moisturizing and it does have matcha and peppermint in it so it does really moisturize your lips and heal top lips so i definitely do recommend this if you are like me and get really really dry lips during the winter and um fall time i honestly love all these products and i cannot wait to try more of these products i always walk past these products at ulta and i cannot wait to try more i will definitely update you guys if i do end up trying more other products but i just want to say a huge thank you to truly beauty for sending over all these products for me to try and introducing me to a brand that honestly might be one of my favorites now um i'll leave all everything

video today i'm going to be doing an honest review honest review of a brain that you might know of it's like super viral on tiktok it's called truly beauty and i was gifted four items and i've tried them and i'm gonna show you is it worth it is it worth the hype okay so first things first blue berry kush this is their scrub now i'll go ahead and read it off it has cbd in it but let me smell it first [Music] now almost all of these products smell like jolly ranchers is so good it's like i kind of want to taste it but it's like no don't do it don't do it zarya okay so this is supposed to detoxify and illuminate your skin it has a thousand blueberries it's vegan and cruelty free so you're gonna want you know this if this is the type of person you are you're about the planet and you're about the animals and that is something i am okay some of you don't know i am vegetarian um yes this is really good scrubbing your skin is so important for soft baby smooth skin as you see my skin like has like no like floss and blemishes on them because i'm super super super super into skincare and pampering myself i've been into it like since i was very small so i always exfoliate and i always moisturize and i like to take you know care with water too okay now their second product that they gave me that so this is the steps okay you scrub first and then this is going to be your shave butter now i already like used it it's literally like whipped cream but it smells so clean like it smells like a rose yeah just it smells so good um so this has vanilla and coconut this has vanilla in coconut milk argan oil and white tea plus vitamin e which is super good once you put this on your skin literally after you shave with this your skin will literally feel like silky satiny smooth it's so amazing i'm just like i just touched my skin i was like whoa wow this is good this is really actually good and i definitely recommend it and then um to go back to the scrub this is actually like pretty gentle but it's like gritty enough to make sure that it lifts all your hairs up so that you can like get that smooth shave before and um again this um is going to be something that can help you illuminate and then you know make sure your skin just gets nice and detoxified and everything okay so that was coco cloud i'll show you again okay and this one this is oil blueberry kush now this oil is for after you shave and after you dry again this is to detoxify and illuminate your skin and let's give it a whiff or yeah so i can tell you which each one smells like [Music] this is very nice like blueberry watched it so it's very lightweight and just look at that glow oh come on girl i just look good all year long look at that look at that um looking like i was just you know ready for the beach i'm not gonna use all of it because i really like this and i'm gonna use it for when i actually go out um so this one is gonna help boost your your skin and your collagen and everything like that and then the last product i received was another blueberry kush and this one has like you know the lighter scent of blueberry so it's not like boom boom jolly rancher but this one does smell like a jolly rancher too but this one smells a lot like the scrub oh my gosh i gotta smell again this is like when i eat it i love blueberries and jolly ranchers are my favorite candy okay and this one is to detoxify and eliminate too and um both of these are very hydrating for your skin it has cannabis sativa no you cannot get high off of this this is no thc okay um my alarm is going off on my phone but anyways all these are harsh and chemical free so you don't have to worry about getting any breakouts or doing patch tests or anything like that it's very good for your skin um just one more look at this real quick [Music] okay this blue is so pretty too like reminds me of yogurt so i'm gonna use this other side and then like literally a little bit goes a long way both of these products are very very lightweight they don't make you feel oh my gosh it smells so good they don't make you feel greasy at all but they definitely make you feel tasty look at that oh come on now and they look great when used together too this smells so good um now now to get to the pros and to get to the cons okay so pros of these products it's a one brand okay makes it so easy to have you know for everyday routine it makes it easy to just go ahead and bam bam bam have your steps ready everything like that and you know they work together with the scents nothing throws it off and they're very like they're very light sense so it's not like overpowering it's not going to give you a headache and um definitely something that i think a lot of people would love and i think it's a great gift to anybody to any woman any girl any boy anybody that just wants to take care of their skin okay um and i definitely also think if you want to have smooth legs that's like a very important thing um it's very hard to find scrubs that are actually so consistent to where you don't need to use a lot as well as the shave butter like you don't need to use a lot at all like everything a little bit goes a long way and i think that's great for the amount of product that you get in each thing um and i also think that the packaging like come on now this glass gold like the color everything everything with these it just looked great and if you see my tic tock then you'll see like they come swirled pre like before anything they're swirled and it's like so good it's so pretty and i show you it's like oddly satisfying but um as for cons go i don't really have any kinds because i could really see myself using this you know in my routine for my skincare um only thing my skin i typically do use heavy creams but they have so many more products other than just that they also have facial stuff they have booby stuff they have butt stuff they have face stuff hair i said face stuff already you know on my face that's why i came up here to clean um and they have hair stuff too so they have like everything beauty-wise and they're in your local sephora and your ultas okay and then also online you can go in description and use my code i'll also put it right here this is my code so you can get money off and then also you can just go simply to the link in the description and i have way way way more detailed stuff on each product so that you can know exactly what you're getting and what you're going to be loving so thanks for watching and i hope you enjoyed and i hope that i just made your daily routines a little bit easier and this video was sponsored however this was a totally honest review thanks for watching and see you next time bye", "5HmP3qfdbTU": "if you are looking to find the best DVD claim for pain you have a lot of choices do a quick search to find the best DVD cream for pain relief and the choices seem unlimited you can get Stevie D creams for chronic pain relief purchase BB

best DVD cream for pain relief available that you can get today that will give you a better tomorrow the medical research says yes but quite frankly it depends Plus unfortunately the CVD industry is currently highly unregulated so it's important for the buyer to be aware to make sure you get what you see on the label short for cannabidiol CBD is one of more than 100 cannabinoids in the commercial cannabis sativa plant because of the supposed health benefits you can now find CBD in consumables fads and a wide variety of other products and by definition DVD products contain no more than 0.3% concentration of THC which is the part of the marijuana plant that gets people high or stoned so therefore CBD products they will not cause a high feeling exactly how are the best DVD creams and topicals DVD products used one of the biggest uses for CBD topical creams is pain relief a 2019 report from their Arthritis Foundation found that 79 of the 2,600 patients that were surveyed had considered using CBD or they had already used it 29% said that they used it for arthritis symptoms among those using CVD 55% used a CVD topical applied to the joints Eileen from Massachusetts she tried a variety of other oils and pain relieving creams without relief for her osteo arthritis aches and pains then she picked up a jar of the best CBD cream for pain and started to apply the CBD lotion to her joints about twice a day and she found relief I'll put it on and walk away and think I don't have any pain she says topical CBD products are also geared to help people suffering with eczema and psoriasis and other skin challenges you'll also find CBD oil popping up frequently like in cosmetics and skin care products these products may claim the combination of CBD with the other ingredients that fight skin aging or that they are anti-inflammatory CBD cream for pain can usually help relieve pain or inflammation that's located at a specific location of your body such as on the joints or to a cool inflamed and itchy skin topical cv DS don't enter the bloodstream so they are not designed to address systemic problems the best topical cvd products don't just mask the pain or inflammation as some over-the-counter topical pain relief creams do this is because of the high concentration of cannabinoid receptors on the skin can burn wide receptors are part of the body's endocannabinoid systems a by wide system discovered in the nineteen that affects many important functions the chemicals produced by the body that interact with the ec system are called cannabinoids and like THC and CBD they interact with cannabinoid receptors research done by Halpert in collaboration with the company Med Terra CBD and Irvine California has found that CBD is able to turn down the production of inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor alpha which is made in an overabundance by people who have conditions like rheumatoid arthritis another study published in the journal pain in 2017 found that prophylactic treatment with CBD stopped the pain and hindered the development of more pain in rats with osteoarthritis our CBD topical products and CBD creams legal DVD topical creams are illegal in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries as well you can shop online or from many local health food stores how to buy the best DVD hand cream for pain relief if you're looking to give the CBD sour cream or other topical products a try here are a handful of good things to know to make sure that you get a reliable quality product number one be aware of outrageous claims just like other makers of products not regulated by the FDA CBD lotion makers are not committed to state that their product will treat or cure a health problem and second one way to identify a good CBD cream for pain is to ask the company for a certificate of authenticity proving the purity the potency and the actual amount of CVD in the product this powerful certificate will tell you the

getting a lot of questions about this here at the shop and i figured a million of you out there will probably curious about it as well we're gonna talk about the hemp green leaf CBD product is Nick come on in guys all right everybody let's dive straight into these products here so we're doing two review today on the green leaf hemp oils here okay there's no difference between heavy oil or CBD oil it technically means the same thing I just think it's slinking purposes okay I mean this really we're gonna tackle three things today it's gonna be the difference between isolates and and full-spectrum hot into how to divide into your dosages how to actually dose your dosages properly okay in a different basis that they offer widows VG base or water base or even PG base okay how they're all used alright so the first thing we're the tackle is isolating and full-spectrum here you can see on these bottles it says isolates and in the red labels as a full spectrum what is the difference difference is full spectral I mean isolate means pure CBD it's been through an additional process to remove all the other cannabinoids okay all the other like THC and all that jazz and it's only just pure CBDs okay I generally always ask people before selling it here do you know does your job test and and if they do go with the isolates do any pop up tez or any drug test in that nature always use the isolates it's gonna be safest when it comes to you know just in case you get that even though in California or whatever state you're at the legal limit is 0.03 percent out here in California if you take the full spectrum and you take enough of it you might store you know your fat cells might hold enough THC where you get pop of the test so just on the safest side isolate means pure CBD there shouldn't be any THC at all okay now full spectrum means all cannabinoids from from the plant okay now like I said the legal limit in CBD here that's not sold and any collectives or dispensary is supposed to be 0.03 percent why did why don't you some people hear that it's better to take THC with a little bit of THC with your CBDs okay because they do work in conjunction somehow now CBD here doesn't have any THC in it I've taken this before I feel like it's about the same I mean such a low low dosage of THC may not make a massive difference or I mean very little difference at all because it's 0.03 percent member is not 0.3% its 0.03 percent okay how do we dose this the best way to dosage dose this CBD here is now generally always tell people 15 milligrams is kind of like the dosage where you can feel the CBD enough for you to feel the relaxation okay if you take CBD and a compound dosage you actually can feel the CBD working through your nervous system okay so it's much more relaxed as much more body of foreign but if you take it in a low dosage look for instance let's just say you take under 10 milligrams per dosage it's probably like a dietary supplement you may not feel it most likely you won't depending how sensitive your bothering body is depending which a tolerant level is okay everyone's body tone is a little bit different but generally under about ten milligrams you may not feel the CBD at all okay so that's how I generally tell people how much they take now how do you actually know how much to take let's just say you're trying to achieve a 15 milligram per sitting okay number one you get the bottle shake up really well obviously - you can look at how much milliliter this bottle is okay by volume this here is a 30 milliliters so you take 30 milliliters divided by the milligram by volume this is 750 milligram by the volume by the bottle okay so I think the math comes out to 25 mgs okay now in in the 30 milliliter bottle each squeeze of the dropper the entire dropper if you pump one full dropper into you know your cup or your directly under your mouth it's actually a 1 milliliter per vial per pump okay not per drop per pump okay that means I squeeze I'm squeezing and let go one full vial take it out squeeze it into the cup that is one milliliter verse and now now if you remember this bottle is thirty milliliter that means you have thirty pumps here okay that means each pump is a total of 25 milligrams I don't know if I made that clear but you take the number from the milliliter of the bottle divided by how many milligrams the volume of the bottle that will give you the milligrams per one squeeze which is one milliliter okay that's how you do the math for anything whether it's a thousand so I take a thousand divided by thirty which gives me thirty-three point three three mgs per pump okay that's one milliliter thirty three point three three mg milligram per vial per squeeze okay now if pretend this was 33 and you want to drop it down the half obviously you would squeeze half the vial that'll give you 15 point three three or fifteen point something all right so that's how we're able to dosage dosage how much milligram you're getting per content so somebody like me I have lower tolerance I take 15 milligrams I am all good alright I feel it any more than that you might get a little more nosh not nauseous sorry a little more tired a little more relaxed a lot more extra relaxed depending on your your your body weight to the fat ratio okay you like I said there's a talk there's a self learning curve between you and and the product I would start off with 10 to 15 milligrams see how you like it if you want more in the next usage you just you know throw in an extra full squeeze or one and a half squeeze okay however you come figure this out now the different basis of your CBDs here now we're talking specifically bottles dropper bottles here okay there's three types of bases here there's water base which is the one I'm holding right here okay there's PG which is propylene glycol base okay Andrews VG orders actually PG VG alright the water base and the water base and the VG base and the PG base you can actually directly do sublingual under your tongue or your foods or drink okay now the PG VG is all if you if you want to vape these oils in your vape pen okay they have to be a PG or VG base or both is okay PG VG or PG PG alone or VG alone you have to make sure you use a propylene or VG base not water base okay if I take this water base here and drop it into your CBD tanks or your slim tanks and you run that you're gonna get a lot of leakage because remember the solution is so much thinner just gonna seep right through the Cotton's out the breather hose it's gonna get all over your pants or your duffel bag or your backpack wherever you have it it's gonna leak right out okay so I don't recommend putting water base into your tanks only PG or VG base here okay I believe that's it if you guys have any questions comment below we'll get that we'll get back to you guys there if you guys have been using these products you have your suggestions for the audience for this community we're always learning about this stuff this is such a new industry we're still learning here we're trying to teach what we we come across here most of the time please share it with all the communities

and this is their thousand milligram extra strength pain relieving premium quality CBD cream and not only have I tried their thousand milligram which is a recent thing because they were sold out of there that's right I originally started out with their 1500 milligrams CBD oil bio tech biotech premium quality CBD cream now these creams are both non genetically modified organisms they are organic with natural ingredients each one has 4 ounces per jar and not only than that that says that about our cream from CBD oil biotech company says on the back CBD oil biotech premium quality CBD cream is committed to creating the highest quality and most innovated CBD skincare products support the health and wellness of people like you who that's cool CBD oil biotech premium quality CBD cream is a powerful pain relating I can advocate to that and we'll talk about in a second cream that deeply penetrates the skin to soothe aching joints and muscles specifically with what I have fibromyalgia arthritis pain it's made with our proven pain relief formula and boosted with high quality raw hemp oil the screen provides relief when you need it the most and both of these creams are from a company I get called diamond CBD and I'll link down below the website but to be honest with you I started out with the higher strength one the 1500 milligrams and it knocked my socks off with pain you guys I mean I get joint pain and every joint specifically my hands my knees my back my neck and yeah it's crazy I get a lot of pain from being and chronic pain from fibromyalgia and with my arthritis in my my right hip and my lower lumbar which is my lower back it gets irritating so I put on a little dollop of this and I'm not sure if these both have the same ingredients but they might be very similar but let's talk about the thousand milligram one because that'd be a good place to start out they do make 500 milligram ones as well and this one right here is on sale right now plus if you sign on to their website and sign up if you're a teen or years or older because these are THC free CBD creams then you get 35% off I'll link down that coupon code - I believe it's welcome in all capital letters and then the numbers three and five but don't quote me on that but um yeah the ingredients in these and this is why I like them the first ingredient Halong coffee break delicious venti iced decaf nonfat latte with three stevia's and extra light ice that's my drink of choice industrial hemp cannabidiol or CBD menthol purified water we've got alcohol mineral oil we've got stearic acid we've got glycerol aloe vera powder another alcohol EDTA we got la Vera gel some things I don't know how to pronounce some other things we've got camper which is a good cooling agent we got tea tree oil that's another good cooling agent for the joints and muscles in vitamin E and there's a couple of ingredients all packed in there and I'll link it all down below for you guys THC free lab tested made in the United States of America made with industrial hemp non GMO like I mentioned and no pesticides and thousand dollar grand one is great and it says for the instructions to not apply more than four times a day massage is not necessary just apply it to the skin smells nice and soothing it's really nice and creamy it stays in there but be careful when you open the jar I've already done one application on my hands but as you can see I'm just using a little gulps worth I'm gonna put it in the areas that hurt the most and we're gonna rub that in for some relief pain relief and then I'll let you guys know what I thought about this side of a 10 star but yeah if you're just trying out I'd say if you have pretty extreme pain like myself like a 9 out of 10 10 to the 10 on your worst days I would go with the high strength 1500 milligrams because that's just like the best option and it's worth the price I believe right now it was normally it's a little pricey 199.99 for the 1500 milligram illustrate the milligrams strength one I can't dog forgive me and it's on sale right now for a hundred and $9.99 and then this one right here I believe is normally a hundred and something and it's on sale for $60 and I'm not sure if that thirty five percent off coupon on top probably applies do you get it for even better deal my I stocked up and got two of these since they were on sell for sixty they were sold out like I might have mentioned on the 1500 milligrams they have these back in stock but if you're just looking for something more affordable and you're just like I got a pain here in there thousand is more enough you guys so what am I gonna rate these on a 10 star being 10 plus and 0 the worst luck job well I'm going to give him a solid 10 a 10 they're both amazing I mean the 1500 milligram I was like wow this is the most soothing moisturizing effective cvd cream for my joints and my muscles that i've experienced and then i was like they're out of stock so I'll try the thousand milligrams got to these and I've had it for a few days and I am not disappointed I'm literally just gonna stick with a thousand milligram one is perfect for me so I just want to talk about that 10 10 star rating for sure on both of those products from diamond CBD company CBD oil biotech and they have a website as well I believe maybe it's not listed on here not sure but they are out of Fort Lauderdale Florida that's where they're distributed so check out this CBD cream and you won't be disappointed and sorry I'm a little not too energetic today I have another chronic migraine I'm trying to figure my way around these if you guys have any suggestions out there or any treatment plans that work for y'all on chronic migraines related to whatever you can think of please let me know I'm looking into doing some neck exercises not just like that but some pole bar in kind of exercises at the gym I'm sitting across from my dream right now I was gonna go in but wasn't feeling so good today I got sick again going off a new medication I started a couple months ago that's been giving me a lot of nausea and migraines and so it's giving me more Naja and more migraines going off of it there you go on pharmaceutical drugs people hmm that's why I love CBD it's all-natural no side effects going off it for a while no side effects getting on it it's just a beneficial plant so just bear with me while I'm making my videos here lately but if you have any suggestions like I said on treatment plans for migraines please comment down below I'm desperate for anything natural but yeah the guy at the GNC in town here the other week said he used to suffer from chronic migraines and he pumps it up at their gym y'all do do or do it funny huh he wasn't like that and I wasn't like that with him but um basically he said to do like the polling Robo kind of motion ones towards the chest ones up above the head and if you can do it with your lower or your upper back ones behind pulling up like that machines and that'll strengthen the muscles in the neck which connect up to the head which go to the blood flow which can cause migraines or not migraines depending on if you strength those muscles so I'm definitely gonna look into that I want to make some updated garden videos before the garden has to be kind of harvested here at the end of the summer and I'm seeing a lot of videos pop up on YouTube about plants that can be grown in productively and survive through fall time so I'm gonna look into that some videos for you guys on that and other than that I'm just thinking to take it easy with my migraines my nausea the next hour long and just get it through this with my CBD and my supplements and I'll make a video here soon on the supplements I take there are people going out to their cars and I feel like a nerve because I might youtuber and people don't know who I'm talking to I could care less what people think but I don't really have much else to say if you guys have any suggestions for videos besides reviews if you want to see I know one of you mentioned a comment if you want to see what I eat in a day overall ideas I can post a video on that I could make videos on grocery hauls if you guys want to see exactly what I buy the grocery store that's healthy low-fat options is a vegetarian and yeah I can do a view on my new supplement regiment because I did start a new CBD capsule that is CBD isolate from diamond CBD website as well as where I got these two creams from and they have 5-htp which is a natural supplement for the brain for anxiety and mood disorders and I've been trying that out as a supplement itself so I thought why not get a CBD capsule to replace my other CD CBD capsules I'm almost out of and try the one with a 5-htp add it into it kill two birds with one stone and also I am taking l-theanine but I can make a video on that I started some ginkgo which is a plant that's been around for centuries since prehistoric times basically it's good for brain functioning so I'm trying that for memory and my migraines trying to think what else I started in vitamin D I started a caffeine supplement despite what doctors say they don't know everything every body like body of your body is different and I started a supplement that is all-natural I can show you guys in a video one day when I'm home that contains yerba monta in it which is a good caffeinated natural drink from the yerba mate a plant and it also has natural caffeine from green coffee beans I believe it is and a little bit of rhodiola rosa in it for some energy and it's all good combination to do treatment for my ADHD because I am no longer on adderall I was on that for a month or two it didn't work for me and the alternative to adderall the non-stimulant pharmaceutical medication for ADHD is just too many side effects not good for you and I'd rather take the Supplemental form in life the natural approach if I can so I'm gonna sign off and I have a lot of great videos coming up just bear with me on my migraines my nausea I'm trying my best to pump through these migraines last nine months a bang basically every day all day and I'm doing my gosh dang best so thanks for bearing with me and sorry if I haven't been very my usual energetic self you guys I know you guys like that part of the Adrian Naturals channel and if we have anyone new out there that

just a little drop here and there in a tincture bottle I have but I can clean out from a CBD tincture I had I like to be reusable but minimalistic at the same time if that makes sense so okay guys I'm

foodie and I'm obsessed with all things wellness now recently everyone has been talking about CVD so I sat down with Kate of one of the cofounders of hempel to get the 101 on what you need to know [Music] okay so you probably keep hearing about CBD so what the hell is it 70 has been shown to help will be 250 different conditions and this shows how powerful it is through the body so some of the top reasons why people use CBD is for anxiety depression pain and sleep are there any risks the World Health Organization considers CBD to be very low risk and a very very low chance of abuse so is CBD legal well CBD is legal in the u.s. the UK most countries in Europe South Africa China and Canada but not all countries have these freedoms so in places like Australia New Zealand Sweden you still need a prescription to go to get access to CBD and medical cannabis so how safe is every day we need to inject 17 tablespoons directly into your blood for any risk of overdose there you have it guys

for your questions honest answers Carol writes in hi Pat I'm having difficulty with the issue of marijuana and CBD oil my daughter and I have gotten into disagreements over the issue I've always known marijuana to be a bad illegal immoral thing yet with the illegal legalization of it in more and more States it's harder and harder to argue against it I know little about its non high version CBD but because I related to marijuana I think it's bad is it a compromise as a Christian to accept CBD as alternative medicine I must confess I'm not an expert on any of it because I've never used marijuana and these people are clean mine I smoked it but I didn't inhale that's baloney marijuana really does bad things to you it has strong effect on your lungs and other parts of your body I know it's being legalized and people say well smoking pot is good for you I think and what I understand if they purify this CBD oil it doesn't really have any marijuana effects in it and it could be good for things and I know marijuana is being used to treat certain extreme cases of cancer etc so I can't give you the medical diagnosis of it but I do think if it's pure that CBD oil doesn't have any marijuana in it so it's it's it's beneficial I think all right thank you for watching make sure you download our CBN app from the description below have an amazing day", "aC-aOQZ8fv0": "hey I'm sorry kids and welcome back to star cash games oh but wait we're bout to getting something a little different it's legal doesn't get you high but definitely has the possibilities to make you feel better health-wise but don't hold me on that if you're under 18 I don't know how you got here because this review is ain't restricted let's go [Music] what's going on yeah welcome back to star cast yes I want to give a shout out to warfighter for sponsoring this review so yeah we're gonna get into their CBD lotion it's 1500 milligrams yes what's in it deionized water coconut oil hemp seed oil stearic acid emulsifying wax soybean oil non-gmo Kosovich kosher vegetable glycerin shea butter okay but now say for the Biblia you can check the site for that yeah I'm not directions how to use this are topically applied lotion can be used daily to address age spots wrinkles dry skin and even muscle discomfort now you saw that you know when it comes to products like this you know I'm very clear about what I put on my skin because I have eczema and I don't want any breakouts so I did it on my feet and on my elbows I must say this when it comes to a product such as it could be capsules it could be like lotion and stuff like that you're gonna have to use it over a period of time to know its full strength its capability there you go you have to use it for a period of time but I can so this is my initial reaction when it comes to things like this I'm just gonna give you my initial reaction when I put it on my feet it was it was that good okay jazzy the best word it was a sensation a shout it was it felt like a cooling effect but then not my skin felt good it felt good you know I was dealing with a sprain and I kind of said it yesterday it wasn't like I've done in the past you know upsetting it but it was bothering me from the gym put this on it helped I can say it helped but this is for you know I was reading on the site let me read exact words it said for the degree of pain it handles mild or moderate so let's just say you've had it like I used my spring for example if it's something I've had for weeks and weeks and I got this and I put it on and I'm looking for some instantaneous transformation to happen no mild and moderate and I think that this is something you use at the time if you're using it for that purpose of injury wise okay you use it at the time elements is you know on the side again ailments that it can help chronic pain but that's mad funny too because it says chronic pain but then it says degree of pain mild to moderate which one is it localized pain muscle recovery and psoriasis all those things over period of time anything you use with is this or and some other product you have to use over a period of time to see its effects you know so my initial so that's my initial take on the warfighter hemp CBD lotion from what I felt just from using it that one time this is something that I would say to give a try if you came across it in order you know if you have these ailments the smell is nice is it's a very fresh it reminds me of us soap it's a very pleasant smell it's it's like it's a fresh fragrance that's all yeah that's it it reminds me you know Dove soap I can reminds me of you know when you have I give you a Dove soap I don't know if any I'll do it but you're not put soap in you instead of using mothballs and stuff put it between your clothes like the Dove soap when it starts to lose its scent gets this dubsmash strong it's less that's what reminds me up but yeah so again shout out to warfighter hemp for making this review possible and yeah links remember you check out that print comment so if you want to get some for yourself and I'm out thank you for checking out the review all information is down below

some of the cd/dvd products that we're going to be selling here at the studio so this is what it looks like the company is called extract harmony it's my friend's company the man behind it is Tim he's my one of my best friends and he and his scientist Derek came up with this brand and the products and they're really amazing so what we have here is three different kinds of CBD oils and different dosages so there's a 300 milligram 500 milligram a thousand milligrams so this is the same product it's just a different dosage and then there's a self here a suit it's called soothe what it looks like is this and it's a topical so let me talk to you about the company is local there in LA and they have a warehouse now in Long Beach as well so by buying these products supporting local business and yes so let me talk about CBD so CBD is super hot right now it has amazing health benefits and I'm just really excited to get it to people in the studios we have to say that we can't claim that CBD does anything because in California in America the FDA has banned marijuana as a schedule 1 drug so there hasn't been a lot of testing on CBD now the difference between CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from the marijuana plant is that the CBD derived from a hemp plant has absolutely no THC they can have up to a certain percentage but these products here have been tested and they have absolutely zero traceable amounts of THC so if anyone wants to use these products and they're afraid if they're like a government employee and they're afraid of getting like a ping on a drug test these products are safe to use because they have absolutely no THC in them which is kind of a bummer because a little bit of THC helps activate the ingredients in CBD but as a yoga studio we a dispensary so we can't legally sell anything that has any THC in it okay so CVD we have to say again alleged benefits the only two studies that they've done for CBD specifically are for anti-seizure so they've found out the deaf studies and found out that it helps with seizures and also anxiety they've done studies that have proven that it helps with anxiety now there's been studies done in all over parts of the world that prove the other benefits that I'm about to say but we have to say claim just to be on the legal side we have to claim alleged benefits so some of the alleged benefits of CBD it can reduce pain it's a huge int anti-inflammatory it helps reduce anxiety wishes are even proven it can relieve nausea it promotes cardiovascular health I'm reading from a little paper here it's help it has antipsychotic effects it's also really good to help people get off opioids it's a natural it's an all-natural way of people to get off of those prescription meds without the side effects that the opioids and without the addiction so but again we're not doctors so we can't prescribe anything like that we can just let people make their own decisions in Maitri seizures and other neurological disorders it helps lower the incidence of diabetes it can promote heart health it promotes bone growth and it helps with in savio may help with insomnia so let's see tell you about the product so what CVD is is they get their CVD from a factory in the Netherlands who that precipitous EVD isolate and it comes in the form of a crystal like really small crystalline structure and it's 99% pure CVD isolate and then they take that crystal and they infuse it here in California with different so in in these ones it's infused with MCT oil it's all organic everything's all non-gmo MCT oil and then in here so that's it just CBD isolate high-quality CBD isolate and organic and MCT oil MCT oil is medium chain triglyceride oil from coconut oil and that in itself has all kinds of benefits that it's an antiviral it's an antibacterial it's easier to digest the most other facts so this is good MCT oil and then in here it's the CBD isolate the crystal combined with organic cocoa butter organic shea butter organic mango seed butter organic hemp seed oil organic beeswax and then of course the organic CBD so there's two different things um let's see so this dosage if you take a dropper of this it's ten milligrams if you take a dropper of this 500 milligram one it's 16 milligrams and then of course this would be doubled this is actually 33 milligrams in the thousand the thousand milligrams CBD tonic so this one it sells for 50 this is sells for 80 and this sells for 140 so everyone can get something at a price point that's good for them and then these ones I forget these are 30 for these shoes so these go on topically anywhere that people have inflammation pain arthritis so it's good to like rub it against like the knuckles or like elbows neck it'll help soothe like muscles and with all of these you want them to be done consistently consistency over time will help show the benefits with these oils you want to put them under the tongue you want to do it sublingually as opposed to eating them of course you can heat them too but it gets rid of a lot of the powerful benefits of it because you're it's going through the the liver and the kidneys first and the first pass metabolism I think that's what it's called it's written here you see yeah first pass metabolism and it if it's swallowed you just avoid all of that so try to put it under the tongue hold it there for 60 to 90 seconds and then it'll get immediately absorbed into your bloodstream so this is for like if people don't have a lot of pain they just want to do like everyday a little bit under the tongue a little bit before maybe before you when you wake up or before you go to bed depends on what they want it for it kind of helps balance out the system you have all of these receptors CBD receptors in your brain and in your body and this helps just balance everything else so maybe if you need a little energy it might give you energy help balance things out if you need relaxation it might do that as well so for me I take this thousand milligram under the tongue before bed and it helps really relax me this is better for people who have a lot of pain again it doesn't have any THC in it THC definitely helps more with the pain but this is definitely going to help like relax and relieve things this is also good everyday use yeah and there's still a lot of things that we need to learn about it but overall it's an amazing product and I'm super excited to have it here you guys have any questions this ends up being way longer than I thought if you guys have any questions please feel free to text or call me and if I don't know the answer I can call the owner and get the answer from him so yeah excited to be selling these in the studio", "URoej2nV3Uk": "what's up friends it's

related but it is CBD related and you guys seem to be really interested in that so we're gonna talk about this stuff today well this is hemp extract CBD oil by potent potions they sent us it um thank you guys so much for sending it to us now this stuff is twelve hundred milligrams meant to be taken orally or I guess apparently you can like rub it on your extremities that are in pain or whatever I'm not too sure but this stuff I'm gonna drip directly into my mouth um that's how you're supposed to take this stuff so let's jump beat around the bush I'm just gonna go for it uh-huh so you shake it up real good first and then you just pretty much grab a dropper full and then pop it in your mouth let it hang out for a minute so if fully absorbs and then you swallow it and then you should be chilled out so I'm going to do it here goes a drip one minute 57 seconds later alright it's been about a minute there we go alright oh when you swallow it you really taste the flavor it's um it's pretty minty which is cool yeah I'm going to let that CVD effect really set in and I'll tell you guys a little bit about this stuff so potent potions is a company out in California who makes really cool stuff it's completely organic and if you're interested in doing this stuff and you want something organic these guys are a great choice to check out now I will warn you guys this stuff is kind of expensive this 1200 milligram bottle was a hundred and twenty bucks so that's that's pretty that's pretty steep but apparently I mean it's super deluxe like 1200 milligrams is pretty pretty high potency makes sense I guess it's potent potions on the back of the bottle it tells you the nutrition facts which is kind of funny um apparently it's 9 calories per serving so if you're watching your weight only take one serving but yeah every serving is one dropper full and it gives you 40 milligrams of CBD in the filming of this video I [ __ ] it up a bunch so I'm on like eight servings right now and I'm pretty freakin mellowed out Motz crazies you know you're not stoned you're you're chilled out it's CBD there's no THC so it's supposed to help relieve anxiety stress pain all the normal things that weed helps with without getting you stone or so I'm told I don't smoke weed but apparently it's supposed to help you out in that way which is cool now if you look closely on the bottle guys this stuff says it's medical grade so I don't know what that means I wouldn't take it too seriously I think that's kind of a marketing strategy I'm not sure but it's definitely good stuff you know flavor is nice and it tastes like CBD stuff like if you have experience with CBD vape juice or whatever or if you've done other oral you know means of taking CBD it definitely tastes like it and this stuff some got like a mint kind of overlay on top which is pretty cool top to bottom you know this stuff is pretty cool I've used it a bunch already and you know on video right now after a bunch of different servings I'm pretty I'm pretty chilled out which is great it definitely works but you know it's pretty expensive now there's other options you can get it in lower concentrations and obviously the less concentrated it is the less expensive it is but I'll link down below for you to check out but yeah if you really want to get into it and you want something that's strong check out the 1200 milligram it's a 120 bucks like I said but you know it's definitely worth it and it'll last especially like I mean [ __ ] we've had this stuff for so week and a half using it everyday pretty good and you know if you don't want something so so powerful you can jump in at a lower concentration and really get your feet wet see if it's something you want to check out and if you do use our link because it helps us grow which is awesome and you know what guys if you enjoyed this video definitely hit the subscribe button I mean we're always here but we need more subscribers and hit a thumbs up because this video is awesome as all and until next time guys peace out", "HIbQyWzeZDI": "hello everyone its Michelle from so they did sky how are you so the product that you may know them I'm reviewing is the brand new maximum strength pain relief it's the roll-on gel just to give you an indication of actually how big this container is see that it is actually quite a big container and the company's got a very generous discount at the moment it's $65 USD that's a usual retail prize at the moment it's on for $50 that's us day of course as all the prices are on the site that's how big how'd you get in that container and it's quite a hundred milligrams or so be doing you know now the company's saying that's great for arthritis and there's an alternative to painkillers I can tell you first hand that I've been using this at nighttime before going to bed for stress muscles in my neck or shoulders etc and finding that the touch-free Rowland application it's just so easy for me to use I find it really really easy to apply I'm not getting my fingers in any product it's applied easily rolls easily it's not a thick mixture I'll show you in a moment what it looks like okay so I've just taken the cap off the product now you can see it's exactly like a deodorant roll-on and works really really effectively I don't know how I'm gonna go shown you with a handheld mobile but I'm about to apply it let's say on my harm and then we'll do a little time elapsing to see how long it actually stays there and with how much resolute there and if if there is visit you let's see what it looks like if we try to wipe it off if it's going to be a difficult thing to remove so you can see that I applied them but you can see the amount that was quite a few rolls of product across mainly because I wanted to be able to show you what it looked like that also so I can share with you how quickly it's actually absorbed into the skin and how much is actually going to remain after that's so two minutes and and also what's left and how hard it is to remove if you wanted a wipe excess off in terms of aroma of fragrance or other experiences with very very overpowering smells you'll find that this is actually very very mild you've got a very light into menthol and of course there's our Karina which is we all know those great for bruising and that kind of belief if anything it's you know your toothpaste would probably smell strong with them what this does", "c6Gwt_5cUvI": "When it comes to quality, seeing is believing.

channel my goal is to share with you guys some of my ideas some of my tricks and some of my day-to-day only to show you that if i could do this so can you and for today's video we're actually gonna be doing my weekly skincare routine so let's go ahead and let's get started okay so for today's video as i mentioned we are going to be going over my skincare routine now i went ahead and i filmed for you guys kind of what my week looks like um and i wanted to give a couple of disclaimers before we actually get that roll in number one i am not a dermatologist by you know by far and i am not an expert at skincare or anything however i do like to believe that i do have a basic understanding of what it is that you need to cleanse tone and moisturize your skin and that would be your three-step system and then sometimes you want to treat your skin so that would turn into a four-step system where you would uh cleanse tone treat and moisturize right after your mask so um you will see me use um the brand named artistry mostly and the reason behind that is and i actually wanted to share with you guys my philosophy is that when you find a brand that works the best with you you tend to stick with it and i personally love artistry because they take natural ingredients and they take that and they blend it with the best of science and then they combine it to deliver you the best products out there now with that being said i am not using the cheapest um skin care products there is but at the same time i am not using the most expensive out there i'm right in the middle where i know that they're gonna be organic that they're not gonna be damaging to my skin or anything like that okay so before i get that rolling i do have a secret so we are actually we well i am i am actually going to be doing my very first giveaway so stay until the end of the video because i will be discussing with you guys how to get some stuff or how to win some stuff before i start actually i do want to say that i am going to leave every single um items links down below and everything that i've used today on my face on the description and i will also put a link whether it is to amazon or to the actual website where you can find some of these items and last but not least something that is very very important that i have found i have made especially my sunday routine in which you guys will be seeing my sunday routine i try to make it a ritual and the reason why i say that is because i firmly believe that skin care and taking care of you falls into self-love and self-love is really really important so not only taking care of your body but also of your skin is something that i believe to be you know very comforting and that is all i wanted to add really but let's go ahead and now let's get started okay guys so i actually started my routine at night time so i'm getting ready for bed one of the favorite things that i like to do is start off by removing the hair out of the way so i grab one of these little handy clips and i clip my hair back the next thing i love to do is i love to wear this headband this just kind of helps my hair stay out of the way and to make sure that i don't have hair falling in my face as i'm prepping my skin for bed next what i like to do is actually grab a makeup removing towel and you can grab any of your choice or whatever you have handy and then what i like to do is this is optional i grabbed the garnier water rose cleansing water and i like to place that in one of the makeup removing um towels corners and this is just to kind of help remove the harder makeup to remove such as you know the eyelash glue if you or eyelashes for the day eye shadow or even waterproof mascara i like to make sure that i go soft on certain areas where i'm a little bit more sensitive now next what i'm going to do is i actually grab artistry's advanced creamy foam cleanser and this is part of their anti-aging system and this stuff is so creamy guys i love wearing this stuff it just makes my face so smooth you can tell right away that the cleanser is so soft and smooth now because we are in a pandemic and we do wear masks i like to bring in the facial sponge that i got off amazon and i use the softer side it has a pocket where you can insert your fingers and then you can go ahead and just gently wash your or exfoliate your skin and i like to do this step every single day i used to only do it once a week but because again we are wearing masks all day i go ahead and i use it every night before i go to bed next you grab a dry towel make sure it's clean and i pat my face dry next thing i like to do is i like to grab the rose all day anti-acne toner and poor refresher i love this stuff now the anti-aging system does contain a toner of you know within the system but because again i've been breaking out since i've been wearing masks every single day i like to go ahead and swap it out for this one yeah you can see some of my breakouts right here guys i didn't like that so what i do since i did wear makeup for the day i like to grab a cotton pad and then i pat it on my face and you want to make sure that you allow this stuff to really soak into your skin give it about a minute the next thing i like to do is i like to grab the vitamin c plus h a treatment from artistry and this oily stuff is great for your skin what i like to do is i grab a little bit and then i put it on my t-zone or my larger areas where i know my pores are large i know it's so sad i have enlarged pores guys and then of course on my chin i'm since i've been wearing the mask i've been having a lot of trouble with my chin area now it is very important that you allow the product to really soak into your skin so what i like to do is after this step you you can brush your teeth at this point just to kind of buy your skin some time and really soak up the product or just give it about a minute or two while your skin soaks this product now the next thing that i like to do is i like to grab the youth extend enriching cream for normal to dry skin basically this is a nutrient packed lotion or cream to help you so that when you go to bed and your skin is really doing all of the revitalizing and basically giving you that beauty that you need this is going to help my skin soak some of those nutrients and give me some of the vitamins that i need then the next thing i do is i grab the enriching eye cream this is what i basically put underneath my eyes and on the side to avoid getting some of that growth free now i know that this is a lot of information for you guys and you might you guys might have a lot of questions as far as why are you using this product and how are you using it are you using it every day don't worry i will actually be creating a video and it's going to be all about artistry and all of their systems and this is just to kind of guide you guys into what product is going to be the best for you and now we are ready for bed the next morning what i like to do is i grab the same hair clip same headband and the same cleanser which is the artistry one to just cleanse my face and of course it is the morning so i'm typically rushing and i tend to do this you know keep it simple so that it's easy to repeat and do in the mornings then i'm also going to be using the same toner which is of course the anti-acne one that is supposed to help me because i'm going to be wearing a mask all day and since i know that i the night before i cleared out my face and i don't have any makeup residue i just put it on my fingers and then i run that and then i like to pat that and let that soak into your skin for their moisturizer for the day i like to go in with artistry's youth extend it's part of the same system this is their protecting cream and they call it the protecting cream because you wear this in the morning and it does contain 15 spf so it gives you that extra protection for the day and that is basically it guys i'm ready to go i just apply my primer after this and i'm ready to put in my makeup afterward once a week what you want to do is repeat the same basic steps grab your cleanser and wash your face apply your toner and then i actually do um use a micro needle facial ruler and i typically do this step on thursdays tuesdays and thursdays it depends if you want to use it once or twice a week but what i like to use is i go in one direction no additional pressure and i go all over my face as you can see here i just go right across in one direction and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna wanna go across the other direction creating an x what micro needle micro needling does it basically promotes um you know skin regeneration and collagen and what that'll do is will help you keep your skin looking younger and it will also help you know promote new um skin growth so that you can go ahead and all those areas where you may have some scarring some acne scarring like myself um i want to get rid of that so i want to promote some of that skin regeneration as you can see here i have a little bit of scarring from the acne that i got you know due to the pandemic so i had to adjust and change some things around before this step i used to actually only do once a week but again because i've been breaking out i added this about twice a week so typically tuesdays and thursdays the next thing that you want to do is once you're done using this product you want to make sure that you wash it with alcohol i just put a little cup full of alcohol and i let it sit there for a few minutes just so that we clean it and the next thing i do is i grab again my vitamin c and aha treatment oil and i put that all over my skin another option is the artistry studios um the the cbd facial oil and this oil what it will do is it'll soothe your skin and this one is also infused with cucumber and grape seed and then that is a giveaway hint hint but this one you want to use during the night time and this procedure i do before i go to bed now once that product is soaked by the skin i go in with my usuals which are my enriching items such as my enriching facial cream and my enriching eye cream i go ahead and put these all over my face and i let my skin soak them up for this time around i'm actually going to bring the product down all the way down to my neck and i'm ready for bed and next up we have sunday's ritual so for sundays what i like to do i pull out this bad boy which is my face steamer i absolutely love this thing as you can see mine comes with three or two different attachments in a cup and then they just kind of screw on to there and then i have the larger one for the full face the next thing that i'm going to do is just place the water into the little um section attach the larger attachment and turn it on and wait for it to steam once it is steaming i go ahead and just place my face onto it and then i gently roll from side to side and wait a few minutes then i go in with my skin scrubber i got off amazon and this thing comes with three settings for lifting moisturizing and cleansing to turn on you just press and hold and you wait for it to turn on it kind of looks like a spatula that kind of sends a few waves onto your skin it kind of feels a little funky but i promise you it's fine then i go in with my cleanser and then um oh by the way you want to make sure that your face is clean before you go into the steamer and then i'm going to turn on my device select cleansing and then i'm going to very gently press onto my skin into a scrub like motion applying just the right amount of pressure and i'm going to do this all over my face the next thing that i'm going to do as usual is tone my face with my usual toner and then this would be the perfect time for you to do a mask this is the aztec cleansing or the pore cleansing mask i also own two of the artistry ones which is a hydrating one and a polishing one or you know you could just go in with your oil which is what i'm actually going to be using today i'm going to apply the coconut oil and vitamin e this boosts facial hydration and improves your texture and appearance and i love to just roll it on with my jade roller and i roll that all over my face once i let that soak i go ahead and go in with my usuals but since i already have this device out i go ahead and select moisturizing and then i flip it to the other side so i'm gonna be using the back side of the device that's how you scrub in this i'm gonna use the other side to apply the moisturizer very gently as you can see i'm actually applying very gentle pressure and i'm going to do that for the rest of my face but that's it guys this is my sunday ritual all right well it seems like you have made

have a great day", "NJwBIAYJSbI": "I'm like I'm getting ready for fall folks I'm mentally prepared alright so today we've got another empties video I have two giant baskets full of empties today I feel like it all piled up super fast I just did one these a couple months ago but I have ten more empties to go through so I really love empties videos I find them super helpful I like seeing what people actually use you get like many reviews on the products and you can see the products that I actually use up and like have been using on a daily basis so if you want to see my trash in you're excited for this video you can give it a thumbs up if you're new here I open every Monday Wednesday Friday at 6 p.m. Pacific time a reminder the heck yeah t-shirt it's available right now I'll have link down below it's only limited edition we're ordering like a set them out once they're sold out they're sold out for forever ok so I got this like container thing from ELF and PR and I've just been stuffing all my empties in it and then I have a whole other basket here that is also completely filled up so first thing I used up is this dr. gel and I said dr. gel dr. jar water fuse ultimate hydro gel so this is a moisturizer it's like a gel moisturizer hence the name smells very fresh usually I'm not a fan of gel moisturizers because on my dry skin I just like more thick and just like thick night creams I really like to feel it on my skin I like to feel like everything is fully in there you know overnight and this one I actually liked because it's like super tacky at first I really didn't like this and then the more I used it I do like it because it almost like has this sealant it's almost like a sleeping mask it has that tacky feel to it I feel like a lot of people won't like that because you definitely feel it even in the morning like you can still feel it on your face but actually liked it for that reason I don't think I would repurchase this I feel like I have other moisturizers that I like a little bit better next up is a CYO long-lasting lifeproof foundation this is my holy grail foundation I have tons of backup since they are no longer making this / CYO is no longer existing I did a whole video comparing this to the soap & Glory kick-outs foundation they're basically the exact same thing you can still buy this through the fall so if you haven't had a chance to get your hands on this everything will be linked down below but buy it now because it's gonna be gone forever by the way it is super rare for me to actually finish in a bottle of foundation cui oh I'm pretty sure is maybe one of two or worry the only one in like the last year that I've actually finished because I'm constantly trying so many foundations and like mixing things and reviewing foundations I rarely actually go through an entire bottle and see why oh I'm pretty sure I finished two bottles of next up we have this baby size of the skin Navy I make up finishing spray Scandinavia just makes me think of OG YouTube like remember when Scandinavia was the only setting spray on the market like I think they're a couple Pro makeup ones and I feel like no one talks about them anymore works totally fine it's not my favorite setting spray ever but I don't not like it I just think that I have a couple that I like the finish better I've but I had this baby one so you should have this has been a long time coming this is the aqua for healing ointment mine has like self-tanner or something on it I don't know but this is what got me through accutane my lips but then I just continue to use it because this is the best thing you can put on your lips if you have super dry lips or you just need like extra moisture on there get it in the tube not the actual lip product this is the advanced therapy healing ointment it's different than their lip product that's like actually made for your lips get this one it works miracles especially if you're going through accutane you need this for your lips it will save your life I didn't get any of like the bleeding or super super horrible chapped lips that a lot of people get on mac shame because I was using this and it is finally gone it lasted me a couple years this whole to have a hydrating micellar water from CeraVe I love this stuff I don't use it on my eyes it burns the crap out of your eyes I only use it as basically like a micellar water facial cleanser I definitely would repurchase this I love the globe gives my skin I just like using this for like a gentle micellar water kind of thing where I just wanted to get the excess makeup off love it definitely would repurchase this I have like a little bit left in here actually I have a perfume here this was from scent bird it's the Viktor and Rolf flower bomb I actually have the full size of this I love at this perfume mmm it smells like sweet and sexy but like vanilla II and not too intense I feel like this is a really good just like year-round perfume but I definitely think of like nighttime in the winter I love getting like the little travel-size ones because then you can just throw it in your purse or in your car or in your Travel make a bag or whatever so this one is totally empty another mini setting spray size that I used up the Urban Decay all nighter I've been using whoops I've been using the Urban Decay all nighter summer solstice which smells so good I feel like I'm here like tickling my nose right now this stuff smells so good it smells like coconut and sunscreen and it smells like the summer so I definitely have been loving this over just like the original one just because of the scent but I'm sure once it's in the winter I won't want to be putting like coconut and sunscreen smelling things on my face but I've been using this one and you can't go wrong with Urban Decay all nighter I'm actually pretty sure it's the same exact formula as skin and Naevia in a cave by Scandinavia so next up I have a Bree oh gee oh don't despair repair 15-minute hair cap things so this is basically like a 15 minute hair mask I don't remember this doing a whole lot like you don't remember being super impressed by it the don't despair repair line is really hit or miss for me a couple of things like the leave-in conditioner spray thing I love but the shampoo and conditioner just don't work for me so this one I definitely wouldn't purchase I got this in PR but this one I wouldn't purchase but I love their leave-in spray thing have a mascara this is definitely an empty here this is like way past you it's the Catrice glam & dawn mascara this one for a while you guys heard me talking about all the times I was layering this with my Too Faced better than sex this one has like a curved one and it really helps us separate and curl your lashes and the Too Faced better than sex is super clumpy and like volumizing so these two together I really like I would repurchase this but I have a lot of other mascaras that I really liked right now like this and slammed all them dolls that was called lash princess this is Linda the NARS climax mascara like I just have a bunch out right now that I'm trying to use up so I'm not gonna repurchase this right away but if you want a good cheap curling mascara this one or Maybelline falsies I love to I've got a giant body wash here this is the Olay ultra moisture shea butter I love this thing it makes my skin so soft it's one of the few body moisturizers where I actually feel a difference on my skin like I feel like my arms and elbows and stuff are kind of like less dry and it just smells amazing so I definitely would repurchase this I have a few body washes that I got in PR that I'm trying to get through so once I use up those would buy this again okay so I ordered pretty much everything in Amazon's new skincare line it's called ballet ballet and I was playing on do like a whole in depth video on it and I was trying out a couple of things and I was just like not it's not that I didn't like him I wasn't excited about it and I was like if I'm not excited about these why am I making a video on this I don't know let me know if you guys are like dying to see a review on that because I have all the products still I was gonna kind of more just like analyze the ingredients since in order to review a skincare product I feel like you need to test it for like at least a couple months typically so I wasn't gonna do like a full review of all the products I was just gonna do like first impressions on like fragrance and feel and then the ingredients but I don't know just kind of decided against it but I did ease up there micellar facial cleansing wipes these are totally average I definitely wouldn't repurchase them they don't take off makeup as good as the Neutrogena ones and they're kind of just like blah another cleansing wipes I used up is the Coach endo cleansing spa water kathleenlights raved about these and I do really like how well they take off my makeup the only thing is like the texture of the wipe there's something about it that just makes me cringe like I feel like I need to squeeze a stress ball I don't know what it is I think it's cuz it's kind of like that staticky like it snags on your nail I don't know it's a little bit more dry and like staticky than the Neutrogena wipes so the texture of the wipe drives me a little insane but it works really well it takes off your makeup super well your waterproof eye makeup like it does remove things super well I just probably wouldn't repurchase because they just make me look used up the whole thing of mac fix+ I just always have this sitting on my make up station table thing because I use this to wet my eyeshadow if I want to try and make it pop I like to set my face with that I use it if I have no makeup on and I just want my skin to look really glowy I'm like halfway out of this one too this is the coconut one but you can't go wrong with mac fix+ if you just need something that's kind of like multi-purpose it doesn't irritate my skin it gives you a really pretty glow I don't think it's super long-lasting like it's not gonna make your makeup stay on better it just kind of like melts all the products together holy grail right here the ordinary rosehip oil I probably go through one of these maybe every few months so they do last me pretty well for something that I use every night and I use quite a bit of it I feel like these lasts a while so I got a few of these as backup when I was in London they had an actual DCM store and then DCM just sent there like entire line of skincare products so I've just been testing out a ton of new stuff from them which is exciting but the rosehip oil amazeballs if you have acne scarring or you just need a really good moisturizer if you have dry skin this is life-changing helps with the texture on my skin acne scarring the dryness it's one of those products that I will forever repurchase because I've seen the results from it and it's like ten bucks have to toothpaste says here toothpaste toothpaste DS one is from crest it's their 3d white whitening therapy I think this was just on like a major sale and I needed something for my travel bagg so I got this do not love this toothpaste it's super thick and it just it's like well it's not that minty I don't feel like it whitens that well consistency of it is way too thick so this was definitely a fail but I love the Colgate optic white one of my favorites the Express white is amazing I always repurchase these I have two powders here from when I did my powdered declare video I kind of just realized like I'm never gonna use the bottom of these so I think it's time to trash it but this is the Physicians Formula one for a while I was mixing this with my under-eye powder and this is just the translucent airbrushed pressed powder really love this powder either as a face powder or for the under eyes it's just super pretty house good coverage and then the Maybelline fit me powder in 100 this I haven't touched in I don't you know probably over a year and I don't think I'm gonna be finishing this off anytime soon I used this when I had oily skin more so I'm just going to toss both of these since they're pretty much done this is the tea tree oil cooling foot scrub it's okay I feel like you could just use any kind of exfoliator and get the same results I feel like the biggest difference with your feet is when you use like one of those real intense scrubby things and blanking on the name right now but the ones that are like a rock basically and you just like scrub the crap out of your heels that doesn't have enough grit it's almost like too gentle to really do anything on your feet so wouldn't repurchase this I think I got this from alta like a few years ago it's taking me a while to go through have this tasha harper resurfacing serum sample it's a sample it's a resurfacing serum so i feel like i can't really give you my thoughts on it yet because you know it was like a one-time use kind of thing taught to harper is super freaking expensive though so i was excited to get this as a sample and then I have this diva curl melt into moisturizer might know Milton to moisture matcha butter conditioning mask I did like this one it was moisturizing I got a couple uses out of it but I wouldn't repurchase just because pretty sure the full-size is pretty expensive and I have a L'Oreal mask from the drugstore that is like my Holy Grail it's the ultra Repair in like the yellowish gold tub so it's hard for me to justify high-end hair mass when I have that one that's super affordable and it's amazing this is one of those things that I used when I had oily skin and I'm just tossing it because it is literally almost empty it's the bodyshop tea tree skin clearing lotion I use this for a while when I had oily skin and I liked it cause it was just like lightweight I didn't feel like it was breaking me out anymore and I talked about this like years ago on my channel so this one is a goner and then I have one of my gold I'm a sake like these are always in my empties videos so they usually use like a couple month probably right now I'm also going through the pixie eye masks which I really like but these ones you can get on Amazon they're super cheap they're fun to put on because they're gold and they do help with like the moisture under my eyes so within the past month I want to say I did a video on cleansing balms I talked all about the best and worst cleansing balms drugstore and high-end and here's the cosmetics bye bye makeup not a fan of this one also smells just like real chemically and real off there is a little bit left in here but like I'm over it okay taking me years to get through this thing we definitely wouldn't repurchase this I have other ones I like way better the clinic take off the day is amazing the Physicians Formula matcha amazing also in that video a lot of you guys commented saying I need to try the good molecules cleansing balm Malory when she stayed here brought it I tried it and it is amazing took off literally all of my eye makeup and everything so I'm definitely gonna be purchasing that cleansing balm as well and that one I think is more affordable had a sample size of the Marc Jacobs youthquake it's a Hydra full retexturizing gel cream I really like this for the few days that I tried it three days out of the sample it smells like coconut smells amazing and it is a gel but it does feel like kind of thick and creamy like I still felt it on my face in the morning which personally I really like I hate when my moisturizer sinks into my skin fully and then when I wake up I feel like dry and like I didn't wear moisturizer at all I really don't like that I love when I wake up and my skin still feels super moisturized and like plump I feel like things are working throughout the night so this one I don't know I would debate getting I need to look at the ingredients I used up the bath and Bodyworks mint and Moss hand soap here this is just one they're foaming hand soaps I always stuck up in these when they go on sale right now I have an orb a hand soap I'm going through but usually I'll use a bath and Bodyworks ones they're fine they smell really good they like linger on your hand the scent and the mint Moss smell is just very tree-like and minty and mossy and things right and last few things are more like lifestyle cleaning products some home stuff's candles so this is the Bath and Body Works sweater weather this one obviously isn't like totally burned through but the wicks just stopped working like I'll light it and they just go out so I'm trashing it that usually doesn't happen to me with Bath & Body Works candles so I'm not sure what was going on there but I love the scent of sweater weather I've run this throughout the year not just in the fall this is like probably one of my favorite Bath and Body Works sense it does smell kind of cologne EBIT it still smells like fall and I'm like I'm getting ready for fall folks I'm mentally prepared next I have a gained detergent here I love gein gein lingers on your clothes works amazing I really love trying different laundry things it's like I don't know I feel like I approach laundry products the same way I do with makeup where I'm like I need to try them all you know but gain I do continue to repurchase I have the pods right now I like the game pause buy also like the liquid detergent have the cascade platinum pods here these a couple times in my dishwasher have not fully melted which is weird I don't know what was happening in those times but all the other times they worked but they did not fully melt a couple times so I don't know if I would repurchase these I like the Target brand ones up-and-up brand a little bit better and I think they're also more affordable I feel like I got these on sale at like Walgreens or something sometimes if I'm on Walgreens buying makeup a lot of the times we'll welcome to their coupon section and their sales section and sometimes they have really good sales on laundry detergent and home things and like dishwasher stuff so just double check because sometimes you can't get super good deals at the drugstore on these kinds of things if they're not on sale they're way more expensive than like Target and Walmart and stuff but if they are you can get really good deals forgot these ones I've to Old Spice amber deodorants nothing new here these are always in empties because I have a back stock of like 50 of these since I bought them on eBay and Amazon and I heard they were getting discontinued I do want to try mirror dry let me know if any of you have done it Malory kind of like talked me into it if you have issues with sweat under the arms and like smelling and things mirror dried literally just like kills your sweat glands under your arms I've been thinking about doing it let me know if any of you guys have tried it alright and then ending it off with some CBD here so I've talked about hemp bombs in the past I do really like their gummies these taste really good and my boyfriend has been taking the melatonin CBD gummies at night just to like help sleep I took it one of the days when Mallory was here and I was super groggy the whole next day these aren't the melatonin ones so just a regular ones I was super groggy so if melatonin makes you feel like that I wouldn't get those ones but these are just the normal ones then I have the highest oils the 4000 milligram pen balms is expensive but I would literally pay anything to like have my pain reduced a little bit so for me it's worth it but I also tried the premium Jayne CBD oil mint flavor at this month I was kind of just seeing if there were other brands that were like a little bit cheaper than have bombs that were still really good this one I feel like didn't work as well for me and the mint flavor is really weird it has this like smoky undertone to it I don't know is kind of gross but I also did just get the 300 milligrams this is 300 milligram this is 4,000 so a little bit different I kind of just wanted it to test like the flavor and stuff with this because of the flavor I don't think I would buy the more intense version of this I think I'm just gonna stick with hemp bombs but I don't know if you have any other CBD ones for pain like chronic pain and I'm not talking about like just relaxing and feeling I need like the intense stuff like four thousand milligrams if you have any good suggestions for ones that are a little bit more affordable than have bonds but that are still really good let us know down below alright so that was all of my trash from the past couple months if you guys like empties videos don't forget to give this video a thumbs up I'm gonna have the products linked down below in the description box you wanna check anything out but I also have makeup details from this in a foundation Friday which I'm pretty sure will be up before this video I love you guys thanks for watching me talk about my trash today see you in my next video bye [Music] [Applause]", "3l_Y2rxWxP4": "hey it says Chris with CBD and former today I'm going to do a CBD MD review for you and go over some of their products I have a bunch of them in front of me right now we're going to talk a little bit about I want to put the link to their website directly under this video in a description box along with a 15% off coupon code so if you do decide to try out their products be sure to use that and save yourself some extra money so CBD MV is one of those few companies of CBD products that I actually use my wife and I for different reasons we've tried many many different brands of CBD products from ones you've never heard of too many that just send us samples to do reviews on a lot of the products seem to work good some work very good and others we haven't seen that get much of an effect from at all including having a really bad taste now when I compare CBD MD to all these other companies I would have to put them absolutely at the top for several reasons number one they are one of the most affordable CBD products their products are very pure very high quality they're made in the United States they have a money-back guarantee and also they taste very good and when you compare that with a lot of the other companies that we've tried that are expensive that we have not had very good results with and that can just taste absolutely horrible CBD MD is absolutely my favorite and their fav or my favorite product that they have is the CBD gummies now I have the 300 milligrams I also have the 750 milligrams which is almost empty so I'm going to be starting on this one the difference between the two is that in the 300 milligrams you're only getting 10 milligrams of CBD per gummy whereas in the 750 milligrams bottle you're getting 25 milligrams per gummy so there is a big difference just depending on what you're wanting to use the product for now most of the time you're going to use these for two reasons one is for helping to relieve pain and anxiety and the other is to help you to relax or sleep better now some of these products have a lot more CBD in them than others which makes them more beneficial for dealing with the more serious issues for example we have the CBD oil that comes in 3,000 milligrams the stuffs really potent I do recommend being cautious with how much you take if you order the larger quantities of the CBD oil this one here is berry flavored and the flavors that they have for these are very very good there are light flavorings to cover up that slight earthly taste you get from CBD oils but it's enough to really give it a taste that you can enjoy while taking the oils and these are pure oils unlike many companies have a lot of different additives to it to dilute it and kind of make it less effective CBD mvs is very pure very high quality and it does work very well so this here is the 3,000 milligrams CBD oil and we also have the 750 milligrams CBD oil and we have the 1500 milligrams CBD oil this one here is mint flavored and the mint is also very good and then the other two that I had were berry now they also have a vaping oil this is vanilla flavored I do not vape so I cannot tell you what this tastes like I can tell you that it smells very good it just has a light vanilla smell to it so the other thing my wife really likes are the CVD indie bath bombs which are these right here which have 100 milligrams of CBD and they smell very very good open up one they all have these little packets in it that has a little bit of information in them and then we're going to have a little bath bomb about this size and they do smell really really good they also have the capsules these are 1,500 milligrams total which equals out to 50 milligrams per capsule which is a very good starting point for CBD especially if you're dealing with things that are a little bit more moderate not quite to the point to where they're severe this is probably a good place to start with that but these are just CBD that's the only thing that's in them the only well actually there's the in MCT oil also which is extracted from coconut oil but that's all that's in those and then lastly we have the CBD India revive which is a lightweight hydration lotion and I've used this several times it has organic coconut oil win at CBD grapeseed oil it's really good for a hydration type lotion that you can use on sore muscles but I haven't really seen much of an effect for this I've tried a lot of other companies lotions and creams too and I don't get much of an effect from the lotions or the creams what seems to work best for me is the oils or the tinctures and the CBD gummies those are the ones that seems to work best for me so overall CBD MD and my opinion is a great company very very high quality products especially at the price that they offer them at and then on top of that you can use the link under this video and that coupon code to save an additional 15% on your order and there's a money-back guarantee so if you're not happy with it you know no hard feelings you can send them back but I think overall you guys are really going to enjoy these products as much as I have especially the gummies and the oils so that's my review of CBD MD I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did please feel free to subscribe to my channel like this video I plan on doing a lot more videos of other CBD companies that I have in products that I'm going to be testing and using in the future thanks and have a great day", "icZDVnqSQA0": "so I got these new glasses there by rag-and-bone I can't really decide if I like them or not I don't usually go for square shapes and I feel like is the kind of effing with my face shape or my hair or does my hair need to be like split down the middle oh no no definitely not that okay so maybe these are going back you know it's weird so just like take a picture or see things on camera it makes such a big difference I mean I kind of went for them because they have this like retro vibe and I feel like they remind me of like men's glasses from the 70s like if I had like sideburns like intense I burned like it would be cute anyway use every mushroom rack they did like clear the rack this past week the other thing I got that is really good though is this 100% cashmere scarf it is from the Nordstrom brand and the color is just like so nice it feels so amazing and the price $129 original and then marked down to 49 97 and then they have a 25% off so I got it for 37 so nice I am so excited and neutral colors so easy I always find them and they're like random colors so the fact that this is such a beautiful neutral is exciting so I want to share that with you I didn't really get that much other stuff like what is happening here but these glasses yeah maybe you know what if they didn't have this bottom black part or is this just like too too much for me I don't know I think it's like I see a gradient lens and I get really excited also I think just this particular color makes like I makeup look really cool like it makes like if you have smoky eyes that looks like very fun I just need to find his lenses in a different in a different shape I think this might might be true dragging like dragging my face and like a weird whatever there are no yeah okay let me quickly share some things with you from teacher max if you see this brand lady may grab them this is strawberry champagne gummies these are delicious you this is the mixed berry I haven't tried this one yet there's also one called raspberry gelato which kind of tastes like raspberries and cream which also really good what is important here gluten-free non-gmo naturally flavored so good though okay these the plantain chips of garlic I can only have like some before I get kind of sick of it as in like too salty and then this is new at the Mackey's of Scotland a rich cut caramelized a red onion flavor sounds good usually something more like associated with like Hawaiian type chips at Trader Joe's they have this new one is said like Hawaiian chips and that's all I remember Oh salt and vinegar Hawaiian style how is that different I'm not something that like salt and vinegar like in a chip necessarily so I don't know but it's there lastly for winter times I got these gloves they're by Adrian Vita Dini and I got them because first of all will they say that the thumb and the index finger that you can use it on your phone I've tried I don't know if my aim is off but this really doesn't work but I'm very rarely trying to use my phone while also you know whatever it when it's cold but aren't these pretty I got them because they're ruched I've always wanted a ruched glove and they're also a little longer so it looks so nice it's like pretty yeah this is not the angle for it this looks scary actually now but trust that they are like really like longer nicer good stretch I got him in a size small I originally found them at a medium when I bought them and also because I couldn't find a small finally found a small finally can share it with you love these they're so nice uh okay yeah so we're just gonna awkwardly transition into whatever the next clip will be okay I want to catch you guys up on some skincare so Tasha was running this promotion if you spend $100 on their website they will give you this cream which is a hundred in 85 dollars it's their ageless and rich in renewal cream 185 for this this has never even been on my radar probably because of the price but it was a really great promotion so I spent $100 and I got this set which has a full-size of the tacho do a cream which I bought last vib sale in December and I really like this I've been using it I can use all year round which is a great plus for a moisturizer I just use a lot less in the summer and then in the winter I can really pile it on the essence which I have a full bottle of and I really like rice polish cleanser as well as the cleansing oil we'll see about these I'm not you know I don't like making cleansing complicated so to round it out to $100 I also grabbed the tatcha Beauty papers these are a little different from the one that you get in a flat pack these are a little pricier I think those are $12 and these were 15 so yeah we got this in order to get this so I tried this out one night I think this is definitely good for mature skin I think this is too heavy for me granted it is the only the beginning of the cult season so I will absolutely try this again when and what in the dead of winter and we're like close to zero degrees that kind of thing but I used it one night and I ended up with like a little small blemish on my forehead that went away in the day but I it is definitely a little like clogging for me at this point in time okay next up I have a little t.j.maxx haul for you I have got the SK 2 facial treatment essence and this was 129 on TJ Max's website it is the 160 ml size so even like let's say you're purchasing off the VIP sale even with 20% off at Sephora I still think 129 is cheaper than whatever the original price is and then again CBD stuff boda is a brand I've shared with you they have started carrying it at Ulta these two items specifically I did not see on the Ulta website this is a body lotion with avocado oil and 400 milligrams of CBD I use this it's moisturizing I haven't had any kind of like muscle pain or I haven't tested it on anxiety intention yet but I'm excited to the hustle butter that is so good I'll link that one below to that when you can get at Ulta this is their muscle rub with 300 milligrams of CBD and cinnamon oil this was very I guess unique to me I haven't heard of people using cinnamon at least the products I see it's usually like that kind of like icy hot stuff and I have lower back pain pretty much all the time and I cannot use cold on it I have to use hot I think one time I had put up something on it like my mom had given me something that they use like my mom and my brother have like I know they had like sore joints or whatever and they'll use some kind of thing that gave off like cold I almost lost it it created so much more pain for me so I always have to have something hot I like heated seats I like warm hot compresses I like things that you know are not cold so this I liked it I put it on my lower back and it's not like that kind of intense heat because I'm also eczema prone so I don't want things to react to my skin so I enjoyed this this was quite nice also so these items were from TJ Maxx I also put in an also order maybe a week or two ago because I wanted to get you know cleansing balms I got the is a banila co clean at zero and I also grabbed this it's per makeup revolution is the purifying priming water with cannabis sativa oil if you look at the ingredient deck on it it's really nice so I'm excited to try there's like I don't think there's any dent at the cone in it and there's no Danai treat alcohol so it's just it had nice ingredients they also to update you on cleansing balms I still like the good molecules over this I tried this out it's the pharmacy it's a good sample of it for me when I'm using cleansing balms I really want when I scoop it out and I put it in my hands I want it to immediately kind of melt town I don't like there to be like little random chunks you know what I mean where it doesn't fully meltdown swell then I'm putting it on my eyes and it's not you know I have to work a little harder also I have like this chunk there that I'm kind of trying to like melt down either with my fingers or with my face so I think if you're just using cleansing bumps on your face it doesn't create such a situation I am specifically using it on my eyes everyday and then using some on my face sometimes so yes I would say I like the good molecules over the pharmacy at the moment haven't opened this one in the last video I showed you one from Sundari then I also haven't tried I don't like spending a lot on cleansers because they come right off so I'm just kind of slowly I guess not slowly I guess for other people it's not slow but for me like trying a couple at a time is like a rarity for me I tend to like really mix up skincare and try a whole bunch of stuff so yeah updates on skincare okay so I thought we try something slightly different today and do a phase through phase Trader Joe's haul and also possibly try some uh stuff that I haven't had before because there's a lot of new stuff that I have to show you that I haven't purchased before so we're gonna do frozen stuff first first Hasselback potatoes with butter and sea salt apparently when I make these in the oven the outsides gonna be super crispy and the insides gonna be like creamy potato I've actually seen potatoes like this I did not know they were called Hasselbeck just seems like a like a lot of name for this then I got the mochi in the strawberry flavor I have been loving the peanut butter chocolate one so strawberry is always a good flavor right wild salmon and yogurt and mint sauce with orzo pasta spinach and zucchini I may have got this before don't remember if I like it it's the kinetic I think that's how you pronounce it although the way it's spelled here but the you I have not seen this before I always see it knk a-and okay whatever so filo dough Astacio and then there's just like cheese everywhere with this is also instagram popular i see it like like videos of people in Turkey like making it fan and I'm like you can like taste it it looks that good is this cauliflower Tot Casserole so they use cauliflower to do like a Tater Tot and then there's a creamy bechamel sauce and cheese this sounds like I don't know I hope they did a good job here let's move on to chips the Peruvian potato chips love these got another bag should I get more we have the reduced guilt kettle cooked also lightly salted I know I mentioned is often but I'm like not into sodium so I like to keep it like under five percent which is like the cutoff for me and actually let me check these these are new the Rose fingerling potato chips look kind of similar to these and this is at 5% we're at our cutoff here represent these 4% these 2% and have a new plantain chip tostones Papa Papa Kunis but da knows Fritos so many okay whatever so many worries so when I first I didn't even look at the sodium because I was so excited about like what was gonna happen in here and first bite I had was so crazy salty I almost spit it out like my whole body like it's like physical like repulsion but apparently there's only 2% in here so I think that there's a very inconsistent amount of salt it's been put on here yeah anyway these are really good though so Foods Trader Joe's is just like a fun food trap right we know that I have purchased their dried fruits like on and off this is one I have a semi forest with mandarins and at first I was like oh so cute and then they're good but there's just there's so much sugar in it I wish they would just do them without sugar because I don't well I also don't like salty things I also don't like things are super super sweet I'm just like a not extreme person when it comes to those things I know some people love salt and like add salt to everything and then people who like love that like really sugary like cavity like what's the word where it feels like like when it's in your mouth it's gonna give you a cavity you know what I mean bakery I have the blueberry muffins so I had tried the chocolate chip ones of these last time and I liked them they're a little different because they like have a lot of like large coarse sugar crystals like on top of it and I liked it and they were really good with giving you lots of chocolate chips but I don't know if this is just me let me know I know that cupcakes and muffins are different but when I have muffins I'm always like why it isn't this like a cupcake like why don't I like it not realizing it's supposed to be less we and like more dense but I have this issue all the time where I'm eating a muffin and I'm like why don't I like this as much as I thought I would because I wanted to be a cupcake right I just want them all to be cupcakes the dark pumpernickel there's is so good and I feel like maybe I haven't tried tons of pumpernickel bread like when you at a restaurants will have it sometimes it's like a bread basket thing but there's this really really delicious like you really taste that like whatever like seasoning it is that I really like in there next this is also sought on Instagram Apple caramel slab pie this is huge I hope it's good I also feel like as a one person I should not have bought this yeah we'll see champagne gummies are back yay I don't know if I'm sure there's with you before but I love nougat I like soft nougat and Trader Joe's has come out with their own so you get a little slice I think it's $12.99 a pound so this one was about a third of a pound so this was 450 I tried to get the smallest one I could and it's salted caramel and dark chocolate and I am so excited my favorite time of the year not a mean favorite but like during the holidays and then like t.j.maxx comes out with all of that Italian nougat love it strawberry hazelnut chocolate all of it so good okay so my battery is like flashing so I'm like running out of time and I will catch you up unlike my reviews of everything once I charge the battery but chilly onion crunch in olive oil with dried garlic and peppers if you put something like the words crunchy onion onion crunchy on any label I will buy it so I'm hoping this will be good and it won't be too spicy because spice it gives me the eczema okay moving on I saw this on my way out it's the Seco strawberry and raspberry Rossini it is carbonated its wine strawberries raspberries and there's like fruit pieces in it so very excited for that okay and camera is going to go okay I will catch you up later okay so workday lunch so I microwave this and it smells amazing and I mean if I would have put it in the oven I think it could look very similar to the box okay taste wise yes oh my god yes get this it's so good I mean pretty sure this is two servings I think I would be enough I think it could be two people eating this cuz it's like heavier but it's really good as far as the cauliflower goes I would recommend this like so delicious okay these are leggings they're from Scorpio Sol t.j.maxx I think when I show more leggings with you there's a pair from forever 21 that are coming in so they're snake print and they're only shiny in certain places so if you're into that these are really comfortable the waistband super comfy as well alright guys so I'm gonna try this like new location I actually don't know why I never thought to come in here like this is my beauty room and there's actually a huge window here but I just kept filming whatever so every time I saw it I kind of like this is easy to set up so look okay what do I have here to share with you present me check the time okay lip combo I feel like we haven't shared lip combos anymore I feel like that used to be a thing I wish your lip combos let's go back to that first off I put on actually I put on the gloss first the Fenty Beauty Fenty glow her original color I have that all over the lips then I kind of blotted it out a little then I applied the lip sheet from Charlotte Tilbury and hot gossip I guess we should just do swatches and then lastly I put on a Charlotte Tilbury at lipstick in the shade Angela Alessandra it's this collection that came out with like the fun tubes and I would say out of all of her lipstick releases this is like the best one I don't know about Hot Lips one and like obviously her original like kissing formula and all those like I bought one like iconic nude I think Hepburn honey I like that color but the formula on these is superior with the gloss on it's super shiny one of the best formulas and then I put the lip liner on blended that into the lips with my finger and then we put this on top of everything and that is this kind of like shiny but also healthy like cushiony looking lip it's a really fool look at that gloss do that thing like this is not over line this is just like that this is the butt I was talking about remember in the last video I was like I have like a butt on my lips yeah that is the butt just reflecting all of that gloss like do you see this is probably more attractive version of showing you then putting a matte lip on let me complain for like two seconds these Sephora sells so I have prepared my cart for the first day of the sale right and I got all the items I wanted so then I was like okay let me just I'll just look again on the last day of the sale to like you know I would just every so often put some stuff in my cart just to like okay I might get this and I get that last day of the silver was around I go in to put my order everything sold out I told you guys I wanted like another Patrick table lip liner and I was gonna get another color both those shades sold out there was a milk makeup and Sephora brush collaboration sold out then there was also those brushes look really good if they do come back in stock I really I'm considering getting them although I was thinking in December Sephora also does like 25 50 like 25 off a $50 purchase like gift card things so I'm hoping for something like that I really bought those lip liners umm what else was in my cart I want to try out the make up forever powder foundation my shade sold out mind you one to two days before the final day of the sale it was there like I was like oh I'm ready to buy this I just waited to the last day to just see what else would be released and I'm just like why did I do that that's so stupid because obviously you can just buy whatever day you want on of the sale okay anyway so I also was gonna get the olaplex hair Perfector number three I didn't get it out of pure anger I just like it wasn't suck I just an purchase it and then I was considering the lunar beauty and moon spell eyeshadow palette which i think is really really pretty if you look at it like horizontally each one is a quad it's like really beautiful so I was gonna get that for the notch again out of anger I just didn't get anything so there's that so on to makeup I do really like we're gonna talk about more Charlotte Tilbury okay this was not on purpose I just happened to you Charlotte Tilbury lip products today but I've had it in my mind to talk to about her eye shadows so the first two quads I'm going to share with you were released together they were limited-edition and then they just weren't available for awhile then they started coming back into different retailers so this one over here is called exaggerated and this one is called transform eyes I have had this one in my collection for about a year it's really beautiful I had purchased this first and then I ended up getting the pillow-talk quad but I reach for this more so pillow-talk it's like more red tone not red mauve pink tones and then this one was what I originally had hoped to pick up when this was released and then I just waited on it and gotten either but as far as pricing goes and availability I think pricing the best place is Selfridges if you have Selfridges global and then net-a-porter the prices are around what's the word or what's the number like 46 42 43 depending on the day and then in the u.s. there 153 so while there's more availability like Nordstrom Sephora like more shades will be in stock the pricing is better unlike maybe like international or UK based retailers so I'm doing swatches for you guys oh the top is transform eyes and the bottom is exaggerated and every - okay this one's matte I think I use the same finger ignore me don't don't listen or don't look at that as the actual swatch hold on I'll redo it okay oh my god is there actually glitter then did I not not nervous I'm like use the same finger again what is wrong with me okay there's the swatch okay are we happy so the lid topper in that quad is really beautiful like the dimension in it is stunning just putting any shade in the crease and putting this on your lid like so beautiful so those are a couple quads these two are the most recent purchase so the first one is the talk about this winter is easier to swatch a palette of pops and I typically would not buy like an all shimmery palette this is probably the third or fourth one she's released where it's just all of her topper shades but I still think that she usually does two more so classic definition of a topper and then the other two will have more pigment so this one is the celestial eyes and it is gorgeous the thing with a lot of say topper or glittery palettes or quads is that you end up with it all looking very similar on your eye I'm not shiny I felt I'm very shiny but are we okay with that I have this quad on in combination with another palette today so how pretty this is what I have like on the outer corner and kind of lining my lids this shade again on the lids beautiful it's kind of like the one in the exaggerated but way more pigment behind it this actually is more like a really smooth metallic to me and then this is just something I don't like whenever this is like ooh my finger it looks like okay every time something like this is included while the formula of this is great I'm just I don't I don't care for like this color and it seems to appear in a lot of palettes as a pink or even as like kind of a shifting shade so I mean I think it's pretty when I blend it in so I have used like this okay let me show you okay so I have the topper shade on my finger and if I blend it into this then that it's viewed oh my gosh yes so I've done this how the eyes before but obviously my lids are smaller so I saw a very little of that reflection but like now it's super gorgeous so now I felt like after realizing I could do that I was able to like keep the like the quad otherwise I don't know I feel never I would have kept it cuz the other three colors are really really beautiful lastly is her larger palette for the holidays and it's called starry eyes to hypnotize I fully had FOMO when I didn't get the one from last year but then after seeing these shades it looked quite similar so this area looked very similar to what was previously released and then here of course there is much more variation because it was like very cool tones we have a green like oh that's kind of a bronze that looks really cool tone but is in fact quite neutral warm and then the last palette from last year was probably just more oh my god I'm just like showing you all kinds of stuff that's okay hold on last year's palette had more of these tones plus more like purpley pink tones so the variation especially on my lids would have been like less varied Wow vocabulary larger palette will take longer to swatch I would say when Charlotte's had my first release in the u.s. I had purchased two quads and they were okay I wasn't like obsessed with them and then I ended up decluttering them because for the price and for like a celebrity makeup artist like the brand it just the quality was not what I really wanted I wasn't reaching for them but I would say after the advent of the release of the 2018 palette that looked like this last year that's when her formula completely changed and now every time anything that's been released since then these are all releases that I'm showing you that have come after that palette I think that marked what I think personally that all of her every shadow has just been amazing so for those of you who have also felt the same thing or who have purchased her initial release quads since 2018 or since the end of 2018 let me know if the formula is similar because I know for a fact when they first released those shadows performed like very so so like there'd be like one really beautiful or two performing well in a palette but okay so they're the swatches they're just so stunning so I have this shade in the crease and around the lower lash line I have this one all over the lid yeah those are the two and then I use the purple from these celestial pops for like liner and like depth but this shade right here is that kind of cool tone looking like super cool toned and quite light in the palette but when you swatch it it's much deeper and it kind of shifts so there's kind of a neutral to warm base and then the flash is more cool tone so that is super beautiful I think fans of like max satin taupe will like this it's kind of like a more professional amped up sophisticated version of that like it's just the formula on here just amazing I am obsessed with this olive green and that is a color I thought I wouldn't use I never liked Silver's blue gray kind of things cuz they always end up looking blue on me and blue in like an unattractive way so this one is a very like what's the word pure looking silver so I'm okay with this and I've used it as like a smoky eye kind of with this green or it is taupe and it's like really pretty so I like it it's like it's split fairly evenly you have like your warm tones and you have your cool tones I feel like if you have this palette if you get this one you will probably have more or less most of the shades that she has and or will release of course again like I do kind of regret following the original one that came out they had like these tones in like purple tones but hopefully something like that will release again oh one more thing leggings I know I've been sharing I shared with you guys the other pair of leggings these are from forever 21 and they are amazing to me they're a dupe for the Spanx version but the Spanx version the camo on it the print is much larger so I think it also makes you look larger this print is more congested and there's more dark colors in it it's also more high-waisted it's also more mr. bowl say if you've ever tried a spanks legging then you know how like an can like really suction everything for you right but sometimes that suction can be like uncomfortable like if you ate too much of your just larger that day these forever 21 ones they're like a little thinner and they make you feel like less it's less compression and pain on your like belly fat this is like more comfortable suctioning and holding in and I prefer this often times even though I like how slimming Spanx can be at the end of the day I often will have like marks like you know around my waist or like down like the side of my leg because they have like a seam whereas these are super smooth and they're so awesome they're forever 21 I've already bought two more pairs I bought an extra small they fit perfectly they fits so comfortably what else do I need to share with you I think that's it so these leggings and the ones I showed you before those Python ones those that got on the t.j.maxx website and they only had small medium large so I'm typically a extra small and legging so the fact that those are small they're obviously super comfortable in the waist but they still kind of fit my legs really well I have like thicker calves and I guess whatever so if you are someone that is a true extra small I don't know if those might slide off of you but for me they're like okay I feel like if I were to lose like three five pounds they probably would slide a little bit on me so I mean boat weight fluctuates so those can be like my period leggings or something okay same spot different day I just wanted to quickly run this by you like maybe this is just me but when it comes to like these essences if you've been using toner for a while let me know your thoughts so I've showed you guys these tatcha and the SK 2 the primeira I go on and off with toners and essences because I feel like they're inconvenient so when I use them sometimes when I'm lazy you will just pop it in the hand you just you know but sometimes I'll also use like really really like super crazy thin cotton pads and like put it on and then just kind of set them on my face like you know five seconds five seconds five seconds five seconds but please tell me why they're just not in spray bottles because things like this this is the Thayer's facial mist witch hazel coconut water because this isn't a spray bottle and its really it has a really good spray I use this more often than not and then also this is the bioscience squalene and micronutrient fine mist this is also really good pretty much if there's a go skincare type mists in a bottle I will just generally use that before I put on moisturizer because it's easier so unless you guys know of any that are in a spray or have you decant it have you ever put it into a spray bottle I'm very curious like educate me like why do they why is it like is why are they always in like these poor things like so this one has a little hole the touch of one while very elegant and beautiful still I have to like pour it into my hand not a big fan I said I want to share with you okay this thing so this is the glow recipe avocado belt retinol sleeping mask that I showed you guys last week in a haul I think in my Sephora haul so this is very moisturizing it's not one of those products that tell you how much retinol is in there it is encapsulated but I find that in reading reviews a lot of people were like oh it broke me out this that I feel like people have combination skin don't like this like if you want this force website oftentimes when people review they will say like what kind of skin type they have maybe their skin tone and for me because I was little paranoid it made sure I prepped with like an essence or a toner first and I put this on and I liked it my skin the next morning was incredibly incredibly soft and hydrated and moisturized and I used it three nights in a row and I really liked it but I do feel like this is something that has retinol that is going to be a very very slow change if you're going to see one I do use stronger retinols so I feel like I perhaps will not really visually see any results from this my preference for retinol products are where you see the change the next day and then you possibly start peeling like day two day three day four there are certain products where I will peel easily for like a week so anyway I think I'm like sounding a little congested I always feel good always sound congested in the morning when like yours cold weather anyway thank you for watching I will see you next week", "Zkodwj-6bHc": "[Music] hello my name is bear real and I am the director of plant biology as well as a certified herbalist here at CWM so a lot of you know already that some of the wonderful benefits of consuming our dietary supplement this beautiful hemp oil that we our company creates but today we're actually going to make something topical so as well as digesting it you can also apply it to a lot of your skin ailments in a topical fashion and so today we're actually going to make a really nice soothing skin South with our bottle of everyday or if you want an extra strength we can use every day plus so the recipe which it will be posted on our blog is relatively simple I am gonna incorporate a few other herbs just because why not they're fun and it'll help with the synergy as well as the efficaciousness and so this recipe is pretty loose you can use almost any of your favorite herbs of course if you're not certain contact an herbalist in your area and they can help you out with more of the choices specific to your own needs so the recipe that we're gonna make today is going to be using plantain leaf calendula flour lemon balm and lavender so the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna measure out our dried herbs so in South I like to use dried herbs just so that all of the water is already evaporated so that way we have a really nice good and strong oil extraction that will base our salad on so first we're gonna start with plantain leaf so plant a go major or plant a go major mmm wonderful ten take a major is pretty common to a lot of places in North America it's a really low growing weed and a lot of cases but it's really great at drawing toxins out of skin especially when used fresh and apply but of course today we're gonna use dried it's also antimicrobial anti-inflammatory it's really great for stings bites burns skalds it's really wonderful like healing the skin so we're gonna use an ounce and a quarter I'm just gonna measure out one cup in case you don't have a scale at home and collegial flour also called pot marigold calendula officinalis it really is good at helping heal and break up scar tissue when it becomes hard it really is good at penetrating that wound and making it soft again so it can really regenerate the tissue it's just wonderful for the skin I love it too so we're gonna use two cups of this and pour those into our ball and next we're going to use dried lemon balm leaf also wonderful and fantastic it's really great at healing eruptive conditions of the skin like shingles herpes things like that that really kind of erupt lemon balm is really wonderful and soothing it's great at just easing the stress emotionally physically as well as oxidatively it's also a really nice anti-inflammatory so we're going to add a half cup of that or half an ounce okay and the last thing I'd really like to add is just a bit of lavender flower I mean it smells wonderful it's gonna add such a nice fragrance to ourselves as well as it's also good at stimulating the circulation around healing tissue varicose vein scratches bumps bruises things like that so we're gonna add a 1/4 ounce of that or a quarter cup as it turns out of our beautiful flowers so now we just have this lovely blend of herbs that we're we're gonna use isn't that pretty our glass dish and you can use any baking dish that you like we're gonna put in our dried herbs okay into the nice glass pan and now we're gonna take our oil pardon my reach here okay so I'm using almond oil today but you can use a variety of of oils you can use olive oil sunflower oil I really like almond oil because it's really good for all skin types and today we're going to use about three to three and a half cups of oil just enough to cover all of the dry herbs beautiful all right now I've poured it into a glass dish because if you don't have a crock-pot at home you can just put it in the oven or if you're using a crock-pot just put your crock pot on low and then you put the herbs directly in the crock pot but since we're gonna I wanted to show you what it looked like in a pan we're gonna put it in the oven on the lowest setting possible so if your oven goes to 140 put it on 140 if your oven goes 170 put it on 170 whatever the lowest setting is possible go ahead and put it on that and we're gonna really lightly heat it for about four hours anywhere between three and five whatever your time allows or you can put it in the crock pot it's an easy way to do it so make sure you don't burn it for about four hours and then we're gonna come back and put our CW hip extract on it okay so it's been four hours and we have our beautiful oil infusion here we've taken some dried herbs poured in some oil and extract all this beautiful components of the herbs into the oil it smells wonderful all right so now we're gonna have to strain the dried plant material out of the oil at least I like to so you can let it cool down for a little bit just don't burn yourself so I have some cheesecloth here into a strainer we're just gonna pour that in there okay I have this beautiful rich golden green oil and this is the fun step we're gonna add our bottle of CW okay and I'm gonna add the whole bottle okay the next two ingredients are optional but I like to add them I like to add some drops of vitamin E oil also really wonderful for the skin and it also helps preserve the integrity of the staff so I'm just gonna add a little bit and eighth to a quarter teaspoon nice I'm also gonna add a few drops of essential oil I think it's just a really nice fragrance to add as well as all those beneficial properties of essential oils like antimicrobial antiviral I'm adding lavender today but mm you can add whatever your favorite is again contact your health care provider if you're unsure which ones to use okay so now we have our oils here with all their wonderful properties I'm gonna give that one last stir and what makes an herbal oil LaSalle's is just adding some beeswax so I find it's a little easier to mix the two and the beeswax is already melted which you can do over a double boiler but it's not necessary you can just add it straight to the oil but you might have to reheat the oil a bit so it melts I'm just gonna add that right in there okay so we have our beautiful oil and our beeswax and now we're ready to parse out so if you find that your beeswax is having trouble melting into your oil all you have to do is put your oil back on the stove at low heat for just a few minutes and it'll incorporate really nicely okay so we have our infusion with our herbs we have our CW every day or every day plus for extra strength we have our essential oils beeswax little vitamin E oil as far south so there we go and that's all there is to it and now we just have to let it cool down so it's liquid right now so we can pour it but as it cools down it'll Harden and we'll be able to use it for any of our skin ailments that we happen to have around thank you so much for joining me today and I hope you enjoy your new self you [Music] you", "wlsHmRvRZ0A": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is Christopher a little bit about myself I've been involved in the cannabis industry in every facet from horticulture to agribusiness and advocacy for like I said just under under 20 years so I've been approached by the good people at popular scene brands calm you can find them on Instagram populist leading brands and pop the CV so what they do is they bring here as much information on cannabis business everywhere from water cannabinoids terpene profiles the difference in ham industrial ham and all the new things as far as products and information and legislation that are coming around on a daily basis so they really are leaders in the industry of providing free information and discount coupons and codes you some of the most familiar if you will CVD products that are on the market currently so I've been approached by them to start a project where we're going to be reviewing some of the most popular brands that you see in the retail shelves across America from different tinctures edibles health and beauty products pet products and stuff like that so today our first product that we are doing a review on together its pinnacle house six hundred milligram tincture so let's touch on everything from the marketing this bottle is probably one of the coolest bottles that I've ever seen it's kind of like winning winning an Oscar for your help with this with a gold bottle the other thing I like to take a look at some to this considered supplement and you are taking it to hopefully improve your overall quality or health there's the dropper and you could see here that this one is labeled in quarter milliliter doses all the way up to a full yellow in there that is cool very responsible of these guys everybody should be doing it should be your requirement it's also in the child safe bottle topper which it which is great because you don't want anybody that's not in need of this to take more than what they what they would do fortunately it's not a pharmaceutical so it won't kill them and then just ride make them poop their brains out but you know that's not bungee so I will tell you that I've been taking this product for a little under two weeks about 10 or 11 days I've been taking it suggested use by the company and I will say that it's helped with my inflammation my knees my joints on stuff that's taking a beating from being in the you know forming industry for as long as I have it definitely has helped with a lot of like that my mental clarity issues it's helped me fall asleep a lot accident typically I lay in bed for sometimes in excess of 3 or 4 hours before I fall asleep and you know I wake up not feeling as rested probably should and I keep in very close watch up my blood pressure my heart rate things of that nature while I'm asleep and it's been showing that my blood pressure has gone down which in turn are testing the lecture-room of lecture just lower when I wake up and the amount of deep sleep I'm kidding and almost twice as long as what I was getting before I started taking your breath product so I'm definitely a believer I definitely think that 600 milligrams is a great place to start for the average adult and then you can either work up and work down eventually the value will be over build a tolerance it'll bioaccumulate in your system if you're not sweating it out or stuff like that but I will say that that's being a diabetic having the vegetable glycerin flavor kind of cut some my my little sugar cravings that I have throughout the day and I think it's a lot safer to take a little dropper of a vegetable glycerin CBD tincture and I did so many reasons people to cook me or something like that so you do taste the plant in the back because it is a cool spectrum product they're not just an isolate there's a little bit different method of how they put these together so you will get a kick back up like a biomass or plant flavor instead of just like a pure isolate which they just put my coconut err and boil so overall I think the marketing wins I think the products great I'll continue to use it I'm definitely gonna get a higher dose and see how what that does to me and how that makes me feel but as a lifelong cannabis easier that's one that really watches my guy watches everything that I pretty much system on a daily basis I will say that the effects from this one I definitely feel that if I were to get a third-party independent test that it would be what it says it is and I will be purchasing this purchasing this product regularly and including it in my any supplement regimen and I hope you need to so go check out popular CBD brands top the CBD on Instagram so you can get some

use two of our products for extra hydrating nourishing combo right now first we're going to take the pearl activating elixir serum pop it give yourself maybe three to five depending on how far you want to go down the decollete okay and then we have our hemp glow oil we're gonna do two to three drops of this one two three maybe one more okay never have too much of that good stuff and then we're

that and how it just rubs into the skin i'm loving this scent so the elixir serum is made with actual rose water and the cbd oil has bergamot and lavender such a beautiful scent [Music] and that is a little htip on how to start your day with a nice hydrating treatment", "OUXC-oNTPfo": "[Music] alright thanks for stopping in with down the road show here today to talk about CBD and more what's the more for ringa the Moringa tree everything on the Moringa tree is edible and good for you good for your immune system good for your stomach good for your skin helps with edema and then on top of that it's got the CBD why am I talking specifically about this brand because I'm having a really rough day with my nerves and my my neck it pinched something about half an hour ago and my I couldn't stop the shaking in my head which was minor and you wouldn't be able to see I have two bottles of CBD and more one is 1000 milligrams now there's lots of companies out there that make 1000 milligrams - guess what sometimes a thousand milligrams isn't enough to stop your pain or the nerve damage or the shaking that's going on even in my hands kind of currently right now so but that is the life I have to deal with and what I have to deal with now so when a thousand milligrams isn't enough five thousand milligrams is what I have to turn to is once again this is CBD so I'm not getting stoned I'm not getting high I can still function like a normal human being and go about my day but if it wasn't for the 5,000 milligrams my CBD and more I wouldn't even meet in my truck right now riding along with my sister to go run errands I'd be stuck in the house in a ton and ton and ton of pain so I I love backing lots of different CD CBD products and telling you all about them and whatnot but as far as I'm concerned this is one of the better ones out there the top of the line if you have a CBD product and you think it's better than this well prove me wrong send it to me let's talk because right now CBD and more 5,000 milligrams that's that's it that's that's the stuff that's the ticket and so when when I'm having my worst days and the things are just beyond my control and no other CBD product on the market can touch what's going on with me or my pain nerve damage this is where I turn to CBD and more so go check them out and tell them down the road show since you thanks for stopping in", "t0fJwGr3NPY": "what's going on guys welcome back to the weed show I'm your host weed and in this video I want to do a review of some hemp oil that I've recently tried and this hemp oil is by hemp kings I'll let you see the logo here in case you want to try them yourself I believe they're a michigan-based hemp company now look I'll be honest with you I've had mixed reviews I actually I had two different experiences with this brand and one experience was fantastic and my other experience was a little subpar but before we get into that you might be asking what's the difference between hemp oil and CBD oil and basically hemp oils derived from the cannabis plant seed whereas CBD oil comes from the cannabis plants flower or the bud they've treat some of the same symptoms they're both really good for stress and anxiety pain inflammation or if you're just having trouble sleeping on top of a lot of other things that they can treat my experience other reason why I got it was to treat stress and I was having a lot of stress at work I wasn't sleeping well I just didn't feel good I was having heart palpitations chest pains high blood pressure bunch of issues that you just don't want to have and I went doing I did some homework to see what what could I use to treat that and I came across CBD oil well while I was on Amazon searching for CBD oil at the time they did not sell CBD oil I don't know if they've changed that but I could only find hemp oil so I wasn't familiar with what hemp oil was I had only really heard of CBD oil but after doing my homework and research I and reading some of the reviews I saw that hemp oil seemed pretty positive so I gave it a shot and that's when I purchased my first tincture bottle it's what they call these of hemp Kings hemp oil now my first bottle was in 1,000 milligrams as you can see this one is in 80,000 and the 1000 milligrams was great the next day I could I could just tell it felt better I was still in those stressful situations but I just seemed more relaxed and at ease and there was just more of a calmness about my day so I was really really happy about it and I used it for a full month that's about how long these are lasts and I was just happy with it it worked really well now this one's empty so you don't see the oil that looks like any other vegetable oil or like olive oil in that kind of color there's not much of a smell to it but the the serving size is basically this full dropper so you fill this whole thing up put it on the tip of your tongue and then just swallow it and that's all there is to it there's not much of a taste it tastes exactly like you would imagine any kind of a vegetable oil tasting like but but it's easy to get down it's smooth and it lasts for a few hours after you take it I'd say the effects of mine were probably a strong hour and a half to two hours of just feeling relieved and even after that when it was coming down it still felt comfortable afterwards so really good you can take it once twice three times a day I don't think there's really a limit on how often you can take it it's more of I just would take it when I needed it and I wanted the results to last you know throughout the morning and afternoon during the peak hours of you know hard work and stress but when I took it the second time I ordered this bottle and this bottle is for eighty thousand milligrams I thought maybe that the bottle would be larger or you know when I got the bottle and I saw it wasn't larger I thought well maybe they just you know concentrated it a little more so it's more powerful and because of that I started the first few days I was only taking a few drops of it thinking that it would be stronger effects but when I wasn't really feeling the effects I up my dosage to what I had been taking with the 1,000 milligram which was the full dropper and I still wasn't feeling the same effects now I don't know if it's because I wasn't as stressed when I was taking it the second time or I don't know if there was just something wrong with it if it just wasn't working or wasn't reacting my body it wasn't reacting to my body as well I don't know what the reason was for that so I want to try this a third time before I make my final judgement like I said my first experience with it was very positive the second experience was subpar on the back of the bottle here you'll see everything that's within it you get your Omega nine six omega threes vitamin C vitamin E everything in here is good for you it's pretty healthy I'd be shocked if anyone have any health concerns with it but always know your body and know what taking make sure it's okay for you before you know you take any kind of supplement but overall if you want to try this out I recommend it I'd say give it a shot I think these small tincture bottles are like 26 or $30 a piece which is another thing that's why I was confused when I got the 1000 milligram bottle it was the same price this is the 80,000 milligram battle so I don't know what the reason is for that I don't know they were just trying to get rid of their supply or if it was running you know hitting the expiration point they need to get rid of it but I just don't know I don't get why it was so much more milligrams or so much you know higher dosage with less effect in my opinion so hemp oil by hemp kings give it a shot I liked it I had a good experience the first time and I'm gonna try it again for a third time before I make my final review overall it was a good experience you can buy it on Amazon I believe they've got their own website you can buy from so it's a cheap alternative to CBD oil and take a look at it yourself see if it helps you anyway guys stick around to the next video take it easy",

but I've never used this so this is just like natural tobacco leaf chocolate flavored fronto king so I'm really excited to try this", "3j_c_dbOsN8": "hi guys welcome to Daka my name is Emmy and today we're gonna talk about how to make your hemp drops taste well less hemp E as you guys don't know about in Joker we don't want to change the taste of our hand drops because we believe in the taste of nature we think it brings an extra natural element to our products and we don't want to you know mix it with vanilla or strawberries but that doesn't mean that you can't alright guys so let's have a look at what kind of products are working with today to try and make the hemp drop to taste that little bit less MP so we have honey obviously ideally you're gonna go with an organic honey that's from a local supplier where you know that bees are taking care of well and they're well-loved we have essential oil so you can go with peppermint you can go with lemon oil whatever kind of flavor or or blend is your favorite just make sure it's a essential oil that's made for human consumption and that it's organic obviously like everything right now we come to everyone's favorite chocolate of course we grab some empty capsules from the local pharmacy the pharmacy was nice enough to give us these for free but you can find them in any pharmacy our pharmacy that we went to had three different sizes so small medium and large so depending on your dose you should be able to find empty capsules that will fit the amount of CBD all you need to use alright so let's start so let's start with the honey you see not that much you can put less or more it's completely up to you and then 1/2 drops alright and then you let it to sit under your tongue Mac normal yes we'll have some honey in different places but it's not a big deal because the mucus the mucous membranes under your tongue but also inside your cheeks next method is the essential oil now be careful with this one because the essential oils are very strong so you don't want to burn the underside of your tongue so we're gonna actually start with the C video this time because the CBD oil is gonna act as a carrier oil for the essential oil so let's assume one to three drops and then we only want one drop of essential oil I mix it a little bit with the tipped and then uh and now like you would with the honey under the tongue leave it a little bit longer because there is less liquid you want to make sure it all touches the bottom of your tongue and now we wait you guys probably will notice a bit of a bitter aftertaste after using the essential oil because it is quite strong but if you've used the flavor that you like for example lemon peel oil I've used lavender you still get a little bit of a bitter aftertaste however or you can smell in your nasal cavities and everything is lavender or lemon peel oil or whatever blend you're going to use so yes you can still taste same sweet oh and yes you can taste the essential oil however you are left with this lovely floral aroma in your mouth instead of grassy ham taste right okay now the third method so this is most people's favorite method it's the chocolate method woohoo where small piece of chocolate here that's melting in my fingers so as you can see it's melting it's gonna melt very fast under my tongue so I'm gonna pop this under my tongue and wait it a little bit until it's a little bit softer and then I'm gonna put some cvd ball drops under my tongue hmm the chocolate is melted so now I'm going to put the Seabee oil under my tongue obviously after that one minute of sitting on Newtown with the chocolate swirl the see video and you're done super delicious alright so there's one more method that I'm going to show you guys it's a little bit more elaborate you will most likely have to go out and buy these but it's a great way of testing out to see perhaps CVD all isn't the best option for you perhaps a capsule in I bought the medium size but there's bigger they're smaller as I mentioned before so whatever your dose is so you do [Music] pop the capsule back on and so there were four ways to help mitigate the taste of your CBD oil to be honest my favorite was by far the honey you could I would say you can't even taste the see video but obviously there's people with different levels of sensitivity than me obviously the chocolate was the most delicious one because you got a whole mouthful of chocolate but it did kind of stick to your mouth a little bit so everyone's different it totally depends on you and how you like to take your CBD I think the capsules are really great option because and lets you explore the idea of if you thought perhaps CVD wasn't for you because of the strong taste try the capsules next if this if this method worked for you of course we hope you enjoyed these options that we gave you we hope you all test them out and if you test out any of these methods let us know in the comments below if you have another awesome way of taking your see video that helps minimize the taste let us know in the comments below as well make sure you like and subscribe this video if you enjoyed it and check out our other videos as well if you would like to join our cvd community head over to our Facebook or down to the link below or you'll find our amazing CBD group on Facebook you can answer any questions you want

Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]", "1haUZOgcpbw": "CBD pain relief cream there are lots of

tea leaf extracts to leave skin looking fresh plump and youthful shop now how to choose there's a whole lot of information to keep in mind when shopping for a CBD topical let's go over the basics potency the no.1 thing to look for is potency CBD doesn't pass through skin easily so it's important to use a potent product for best results potent products tend to contain at least 200 milligrams of CBD per container though some contain up to 1000 milligrams CBD source chances are you may have seen the terms isolate full spectrum and broad spectrum before these terms refer to the ways in which CB is extracted while isolates are ideal for consumers who want to be sure there's no THC in their product this extraction method strips away other cannabinoids and volatile organic compounds like terpenes reducing the overall therapeutic benefits of the CBD broad-spectrum products contain most cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant but don't contain THC full-spectrum products preserve all cannabinoids enter peens in the final product this is important because CBD and THC may work better together than they do alone thanks to the entourage effect note that any full-spectrum products made from hemp will still only contain 0.3% THC or less so it's still a relatively small amount quality control do you know where your hemp was grown reliable brands will often have this information readily available with some brands even going as far as to provide a certificate of analysis koa that'll allow you to view testing results with ease ideally you'll want to look for products made from US grown certified organic hemp since cannabis grown in the United States as subject to agricultural regulations be sure whatever you buy has been lab tested ideally by a third party and is pesticide and mold free be wary of products that don't provide this information either on their website or by emailing the company ingredients it's a good idea to opt for all natural organic ingredients whenever available you'll get all the benefits of the ingredients without the chemicals and pesticides price most CBD topicals fall in the $30 to $60 range pay close attention to products priced at over $100 you may decide they're worth it but do a little digging to be sure before you shell out the extra cash do they contain full spectrum CBD how potent are they do they contain other healing herbs or oils how to use topicals are meant to be massaged into the skin so you'll apply them directly to the affected area depending on other ingredients in the product you might feel tingling war or cooling sensations if you're using the product for pain you should start to feel effects relatively quickly if you're using it for a skin condition like acne or eczema you may have to apply it a few times to see results always refer to the packaging for specific directions and recommendations from the manufacturer precautions and side effects most topicals are safe to reapply as needed pay special attention to the type of carrier oil your product as made with since products based in coconut oil may melt when exposed to heat these products should be kept in a cool dark place be sure to read the packaging as most topicals are only meant for external use and many are not meant to be used on broken skin CBD as non-intoxicating meaning it won't get you high it's generally recognized as safe and there are a few side effects though they do occur occasionally possible side effects fatigue diarrhea changes in appetite changes in weight while CBD doesn't typically enter the bloodstream through topical application it's possible it may interact with some medications some research suggests that CBD may interact with liver enzymes and temporarily stop the liver from metabolizing other drugs or breaking down toxins always consult your doctor before using products with CBD even topicals", "WdmNQ_AinSc": "[Music] hi beauties today i'm talking about my fall favorites and the first item

you one of the 50 million Americans or countless number worldwide that suffers from arthritis do you have chronic pain from a past injury or are you somebody who constantly finds themselves in the medicine cabinet for a pain killing pill or cream if you're watching this no doubt you've heard of CBD cream and probably heard that it helps with pain but does it work for arthritis doesn't work for chronic pain or muscle soreness and is CBD cream better than CBD oil for pain relief well give me a few minutes of your attention and we'll address these questions and a few that you might not have thought of yet so let's start by looking at what CBD cream is and how it's supposed to work well CBD oil and cream affect your endocannabinoid system which is important in regulating things like hunger mood memory and yes pain because of this early studies believe that CBD relieves pain in a few different ways the first is by helping your body produce natural endocannabinoids that relieve pain in needed areas by slowing down metabolisms so the body can help focus on healing the next form is by helping to repair the damaged muscles when you strength train or strain your body in a way that is not normal you create micro tears in your muscles the body's natural response is to send inflammatory mediators to help the repair in CBD by limiting these signals can relieve some of the soreness and pain without slowing down the healing process lastly CBD is believed to fire pain receptors that naturally release heat and soothe pain this controls your nervous system to help heal rather than inflame with the science out of the way the question becomes does it actually work the answer is yes with a slight reservation since 2011 there have been five major studies that show CBD cream helps to reduce our thready spain inflammation and muscle soreness unfortunately this is not enough evidence for any medical organization including the FDA to approve CBD oil or cream as a medical treatment for arthritis now considering trying CBD cream over CBD oil for general health we regularly recommend CBD oil for a lot of reasons but for pain inflammation or muscle soreness there are a lot of benefits for the cream version treating one area directly with the cream should be faster targeting relief to the affected area plus the CBD cream is focused on one area and it may last longer than its oil counterpart we know that this video just scratched the surface of questions about CBD creams and oils so we are offering a free ebook to really inform you about CBD and make sure

everybody welcome back to my channel my name is America thank you so much for being here today I am reviewing some vapes from head base they are cvd vapes which are going to be legal in all 50 states so if you live in a non recreational a legal state you can still be puffing on CBD which has a lot of health benefits pempek has these cool CBD vapes that help you with whatever ailment you're facing for example they have a mimosa which is the recovery like when you have a say you're hungover tropic thunder focus it's meant for like if you have important things to do errands to run if you got to be present and then the Blue Dream p.m. and that is the sleepy time one it's gonna help aid in going to sleep at night so I'm gonna give it a shot you know I love CBD it's very popular it's become mainstream because it works and so people have started to realize that now that cannabis has become more accepted and open people are very much more open minded and even you see you can see DVDs sold at the grocery store so this is a very normal way to consume hemp or cannabis it contains less than 0.3 percent THC and there needs to be a little bit of THC in there to activate the CBD fully I want to show you how these baits work that's why you're here I'm gonna start with the mimosa nice packaging right here suggested use one-two-three second puff contains a hundred to 60 puffs I don't follow the rules here's the mimosa head base and let me read it to you it says whether it's been a long workout long day or long week kick up your feet with this juicy formula to briefs ahead this is Clementine and grapefruit blend helps relax the muscles and calm the mind so relaxation and mind call me perfect all right let's do this so also as you know I say Cheers too much and I've mentioned it on my Instagram a couple of times if you follow me there but I'm trying to think of something you to say and I would they light it up but this you can't like so puff it up boom I do taste grapefruit and Clementine so it tastes good and it hits really well and this lights up if you notice when it when it when I hit it it's a half a gram and two hundred milligrams of CBD that was really tasty do I seem more like do I seem relaxed I like the taste that's good okay there's that now we're gonna try the focus I guess I feel really good like sometimes I get anxiety or like embarrassment I'm like oh my god I can't believe I just got that especially I'm shooting videos I'm like do I make any sense subedi helps cause my nerves and it can help calm your nerves to like depression anxiety it's not like a instant fix but I can tell like if I continually take CBD I feel a little uplifted compared it's it like like tough you guys like this [ __ ] tough I think I feel good I feel good I feel great let's try this one see if it does anything it's the focus I'm gonna read it to you it says it's Tropic Thunder okay hitting that afternoon wall show those last few hours of work who's boss with this concentration in inducing blend sweet and citrus flavor keep you mellow and focused so you can get [ __ ] done that's what it says on their website is this okay focus Tropic Thunder here we go light it up a bit puff it up we're trying to not say cheers pinky oh I kept it pinky out tastes like bubblegum good oh I can see that this yeah this is good I like this a lot I like it a lot sorry my dumb and Dumberer quote so these are disposable vapes once you're done with them you just toss them there's no recharging and they retail online for $35 each for half a grant which is not a bad price for CBD CBD at the drugstore is very expensive okay that was the focus tropic factor am i talking faster now like can you even sell I don't know alrighty who are here at the p.m. one I don't think it'll make me fall asleep hopefully not because I am awake it's blue dream and again half a gram 200 milligrams of hex extract is what it say let me read it to you you made it you owned another day this bleep promoting formula encourages faster and better sleep to prepare you for another vibrant day something tells me I should not be smoking this right now it is like 3 p.m. in the afternoon on the Friday and I have things to do but in the name of science and for you I'm doing this for you to see if you want to buy this because CBD is good for you and I love helping people which includes you because you're my friend so let's try this blue dream p.m. sleepy time babe from his face pinky it didn't say the flavor there did it I don't know if I can tell what it it blueberry if I smoke the focus with the PN does it make it a hybrid I feel something uplifted but not elevated do you get what I mean like I feel you know like ask if you're starving and you eat a huge meal full of nutrients you get that natural high I feel like I have a natural high without smoking weed I mean it is kind of smoking weed but it's not really and if you want best if you want to kind of smoke weed but not really with me hit up head face y'all I'm gonna put their website and info here for y'all to see if I had to say which one was my favorite flavor I would say these two are my favorite flavors the focus and the p.m. the recover mimosa was really good too but I just liked the very ones better my honest expert opinion these are actually really nifty and I like that they're color-coordinated this is dope this is like something that I think my mom or grandma would enjoy because if I'd give them any other thing to smoke they'd be scared of it you know but since its CBD and since it's like so cute I think this is the way to help my asian family become more open-minded about hemp and cannabis as a medicine instead of as a party drug or a drug in general because it's not the drug it's a plant and on that note we are checking out thank you for joining me check out my website check out my Instagram and subscribe like this video comment pikiao oh my god I'm so lame thank you bye", "rJUT0p7Jnx0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] CBD industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world right now and according to Forbes by 2020 the CBD industry is expected to grow by seven hundred percent adding billions of dollars in revenue prior to the 2014 farm bill getting past hemp hadn't really been grown in the United States for over 50 years and now hemp and CBD is making the biggest comeback that we've ever seen what's really exciting about the CBD industry right now is it's becoming mainstream popular the facts are coming out people have come to the realization that this isn't some plant that if you use it it's a one-way ticket to Nowheresville you've got new stations and the media they're talking about it celebrities are starting to speak up about it everywhere I go people are talking about CBD oil my friends my neighbors neurosurgeon dr. Sanjay Gupta he's been a huge advocate for cannabis on CNN and he's even made a documentary about its benefits this industry is big news I really believe that the truth about CBD and cannabis is starting to come out you know it's been demonized for so many years you'd be labeled a low-life a STONER a druggie all these negative things and people are now starting to realize that there's medicinal benefits once you start to really look at the history of this plant you'll come to find that the truth is nothing what we've been told you're seeing restrictions being left it's a hot product it's a hot industry more and more states are legalizing it and that's creating a huge opportunity for the CBD industry it's becoming more normal it's becoming more mainstream and people want to know the truth according to Forbes there's over 25,000 products that can be created using him this is one of the most vital plants to mankind and we're bringing it back to the world Josh came home with some CBD oil that he had been kind of behind the scenes working on as soon as I tried it I knew that things were beginning to change for me so we've been looking at ways to mass-produce this oil so that we could bring it to everybody globally when we decided to launch hemp works we knew that we needed to come out with unique products products that were high quality products that were affordable products that were different than from what's out there in the market and I believe we had to find and secure partnerships with the top farms in the industry a lot of other oils out there are not using the extraction method that we have what separates hemp works from other products that I've tried is for one we don't dilute our product with any other fillers many people brought their CBD in and it goes through a process where it gets bleached and neutralized and by the time it gets here yeah it's not it's not what it was before it went through that process we searched high and low and we found one of the top farms in the world for CBD and we secured an amazing partnership it's coming from America the farms that we've connected ourselves to and that Josh was able to go out and create relationships with there is not a second or third I mean they are the best of the best through this farm and partnership we knew that we could bring the highest quality and the purest CBD products to the rest of the world and our two flagship products are our CBD oils they come in two concentrations a 500 milligram and a 750 milligrams concentration and there's two flavors a peppermint flavor and a or flavor what's so amazing about the CBD oil is there's trillions of receptors in our body and our body we have an endocannabinoid system which is also known as the ECS there's cb1 receptors and there cb2 receptors cb2 receptors are activated when you take products that are high in CBD so by taking our CBD oil you're activating the cb2 receptors in your body after I began trying these products I knew that they were a life-changing and I knew that I couldn't keep this to myself so we have three topicals with the hemp Works line renew revive and relief renew is an anti-aging cream that's got CBD the cannabis sativa and it also has apple stem cells revive is a CBD moisturizer so it's an ampm moisturizer it's got CBD and it's also got collagen retinol the third product in our line is relief relief is a topical pain rub that's got CBD and emu oil what really makes our partnership different is four things number one the farming our farms exclusively grow and manufacture CBD and hemp products one of the benefits of having the farm here in the United States is we can control the supply chain we know that it's quality we know where it's grown we know how it's grown we can see the leaves we can get all the test data that we need and that's a big deal for consumers for our customers we want to make sure that we give them the highest quality CBD products that are out there number two the science our agricultural partners have an in-house team of scientists product developers lab researchers and even professors in the universities they're in Kentucky having that team that we can leverage to be able to help produce these products gives us the confidence to be able to go out and market these products to the masses number three fresh lock drying is a proprietary system that our agricultural partners have that basically eliminates all the molds and pathogens that happen during flash processing so to the end consumer that means that by the time you get the finished product all of the phytochemicals are intact we're so confident as a company that we're giving people the highest quality and purest product that's out there on the market and we have the tests to prove it and number four compliance under the 2014 farm bill it's legal to sell and ship these products across state lines as long as you have less than point zero three percent THC by dry weight so one of the ways that we've become compliant as a company is we have upheld all of the federal standards and restrictions when it comes to CBD and hemp because of the partnership with the farms and being so close to the the growing process we've been able to produce gas chromatography tests micro CRO bial tests a certificate of analysis every time we do a batch all of our products are sent to a third-party lab for testing and for stability testing so we know that we can be 100% compliant as we sell and market these products to the rest of the world I knew what hemp uruk's did for me I wasn't really sure what it was gonna do for everybody else and when we first started bringing hemp works to other people the amount of testimonies that we've had in such a short amount of time has been straight-up unbelievable to hear people say how they have back pain or neck pain or whatever type of pain and look in a few doses some of these people are experiencing relief from pain I am a senior citizen and I taught dance for 28 years and so I have a lot of aches and pains that are just residual effects of my career and I was looking for ways to really feel better it has so many different uses it's helping so many people just being able to jump up out of bed versus slowly maneuvering out of bed and walking a few steps before the body says okay we can do this today those little tiny things have improved my quality of life in terms of just doing the day-to-day things that we need to since I have started taking CBD internally and also topically it has been like a rebirth you have nothing to lose to try this product out you will all of a sudden realize that pain in a few days CBD is just absolutely given me a whole new lease on life until I started researching about it and hearing about hemp works I had no idea how big this was CBD is becoming the answer and a true solution when it comes to both neurological and immunological wellness Farm trusted high CBD is the new superfood grown on American farms so the hemp works mission is twofold the first part is we want to bring this plant back to the rest of the world another part of our mission is they want to empower people by sharing this amazing plant with their friends and their family CBD oil and the CBD industry I believe is the next trillion dollar industry really the best is yet to come we figured out a way to watch hemp works inside of my daily choice and the rest is history you [Music]", "SJQ04cVDzs0": "hello and welcome to CTF oh where we are changing the future outcome of people's health and well and welcome to our paint plant training video I want to start out by saying how proud I am of the fact that we're truly different than other companies in this industry we have amazing products that are not overpriced we have a compensation plan like none other it's a four-part hybrid compensation plan with parts of it actually copyrighted and we even have these things called online visitors that help you build your income and get paid for doing so so let's move on and show you all that right now all the Commission's you can earn here and all the income generated happen from the sale of our products whether that's our CBD product line or our non CBD product line which includes those online visitors that I was mentioning this is traffic that is sent to your free CTF Oh website and it actually helps you build your team and the first way that you can earn income is because all these products on your website are deeply discounted at a 30% discount below the suggested retail price it's like you're getting them at wholesale pricing and you can buy them and sell them to others and make 30 percent on each sale but that's just one way you can earn income here what we're gonna do from this point forward is talk about something called commission volume or CV and all our CTF o products create CV this is important because it allows us to do two things first CV allows us to keep our products priced extremely fairly while still paying out generous Commission's and second CV sets us up for global expansion currently we're in the United States and Canada but with CV we will have a seamless ability to expand worldwide let's look at an example of exactly what CV is let's say you buy a product at forty nine ninety seven a lot of our products that is the actual sale price of them and one sample CV volume is commish volume amount is $27 now what that is is the amount that we pay out in commissions to the associates the difference between the product price and the commission volume is what keeps the company going it pays for the overhead it pays for the actual product itself and it allows us to stay in business and continue paying the full commission volume and one thing I want to point out here is that we pay out a hundred percent of the commission volume it gets paid to you our associates and it's a whole lot different than a lot of other companies that brag about paying 80% or 70% or maybe 85 percent we pay a hundred percent of the Commission volume on each and every sale and for the full details of all the ranks and qualifications of everything I'm going to be sharing with you in this video you can see our compensation plan chart and our compensation plan overview document we are very transparent here we make it very easy for you to understand fully everything that's going on at CTF oh because we like to say the deeper you dig the better it gets okay let's talk about CV and how it pays out in three very powerful ways there's three unique ways they pay you simultaneously they're all extremely powerful and the first one is called unilevel pay your levels been around in our industry for a long time what we've done at CTF o is make sure that it benefits you instead of challenging you and the way we payout unilevel is through five levels a you level is simply what's also known as a sponsorship level anyone that you introduced to CTF Oh anyone that you sell a product or that you bring into the company will be on your first level and anybody that they share c2fo with that they bring into the company will be on their first level which is your second level and so on through five levels here now because you're doing the work of sharing CTF oh with new people that are going on your first level you're gonna get the lion's share of the pay there see that 20% now when those people enroll others sharing CTF oh our products and our business with other people the people they share it with are going to be on your peoples first level which is your second level and again that can hold an unlimited number of people and those people sharing with others who share with others as you can see we pay down through five levels on this unit level pay four percent on levels two through five but again those are continuing every time any one on any of those Yoona levels makes a purchase you get paid 20% on the first level and 4% on levels two through five okay let's look at an example of just how powerful unit level pay can be for you there's the levels there's the percentages and for this example we're going to use an average CV of 50 and let's say you bring in three people you remember anyone you bring in goes on your first level so there's three people on your first level and you earn twenty percent of anything they purchased so with an average CV value of 50 you're gonna earn thirty dollars that's the work that you did but what happens in our industry is that what you do tends to duplicate throughout your team so if you bring in three people there's a good chance they could bring in three who could bring in three etc and on these five levels you could end up with a team looking like what's shown on your screen right now well that's work that they did not work that you did but you're still gonna get paid for it in fact the total there seven hundred and fifty dollars could be monthly income from you just bringing in three people who brought in three who brought in three with everybody just having an average CV purchase of fifty dollars on monthly consumable products so that's 750 dollars in this example of just you bringing in three but what happens if you do more than that what happens if you bring in five people I like to give you a couple of examples here if you bring in five there's a good chance that's gonna duplicate on your team so five get five get five you end up with a larger team there but the percentage is still pay out the same and instead of 750 dollars it changes to seven thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and all you do was bring in two more people and have that duplicate through five levels of your your level or sponsorship tree and I'm not going to stop there because we have people sharing c2fo with so many others it's realistic that you might bring in seven people and again that might duplicate right on down through your team so if seven got7 got7 you can see you end up with a whole lot more people on those five levels the percentages stay the same but your income is almost $40,000 a month thirty nine thousand two hundred seventy dollars again these are consumable products with an average CV of fifty you could be earning almost forty thousand dollars in monthly pay and this is just the first way we payout unilevel pay now let's talk about the second way you get paid which is regenerating matrix pay and remember these payouts simultaneously as you're earning your unilevel pay you're also going to be earning regenerating matrix pay so matrix levels are different than unit levels we have what's called a three by matrix and what that means is that every person which is a position in the matrix every position on the matrix can only have three positions on the level directly beneath it so on your first matrix level beneath your spot when you join the company there can only be three people right beneath that three positions and since they can each only have three positions underneath them their first levels will be three each to them which means you can have nine people or nine positions on your second level and each level triples in the number of positions or people that can be there beneath you so as you can see as we go down through these levels it just keeps tripling now we pay 1% of the cv on levels one through five ten percent on level six and seven and then again one percent each on levels eight through twenty one I don't know of another company that pays you twenty one levels in a matrix but I do know this is some extremely powerful retirement pay which I'm going to talk more about in just a second the thing that I want to point out here is that because it's simultaneous a lot of times the same people that are on your or levels one through five in your unit levels are going to be on those same levels in your matrix levels because if you bring in three there on your first level of each and if they bring in three there on your second level of each so that means that on these matrix levels where you see the 1% on levels 1 through 5 you could be earning twenty one percent or five percent on each of those levels because you're actually getting paid both these pays simultaneously let me give you an example of how regenerating matrix pay can work for you there's what we were just looking at the levels the people and the percentages and we're going to again use an example of your CV average being 50 per order or per person purchasing here there's you above your levels and there's the three that can be on your first level and again they can just triple all the way down as three who get three you get three now because you can only have three you could bring in four or five or six and they would spill down underneath I'm gonna show you what happens then a little later on in the video but for this example let's just say you brought in three who brought in three who brought in three that's what your first seven levels would look like we're just gonna talk about seven levels here as you go from levels 8 through 21 the numbers get astronomical and we don't want you to need oxygen as you're understanding what you've got your hands on here okay that's what the percentages equate to if you just get three who get three who get three with an average CV of 50 per order 50 CV per order can earn you fourteen thousand seven hundred sixty one dollars and fifty cents again that's monthly pay and that's in addition to the unit level pay that we already talked about previously this is really powerful now while we're talking about regenerating matrix pay I want to introduce you to the copyrighted portion of our compensation plan because see TFO helps you multiply that regenerating matrix pay like no other company can because we copyrighted and it happens automatically you don't have to balance anything you don't have to place people there's no legs to worry about equaling each other there's none of that that challenges so many people in our industry we've set it up to benefit you to the maximum potential possible and all you have to do is keep sharing CTF o with others so we're going to be talking about the power of copyrighted profit sharing positions and that's a mouthful so I'm just gonna say PSPs we're gonna be talking about PSPs okay when you join our company for free when you enroll your first three people they could land on your first matrix level like it's shown here they join for free just like you and then whenever they purchase a product you are in that 20% you level pay from anything they purchase plus of course you're gonna earn the 1% if they're on your first level or whatever level they may fall on as you continue to enroll more and more people now when you enroll a fourth person who joins for free you're also gonna earn 20% you level pay from anything they purchase but something magical happens from the fourth enrollee on the system generates a new uau number two for free now as you can see with the U number one you can get paid from 21 levels of the regenerating matrix pay well the same thing happens with you number two that's a whole new 21 levels of pay that was just given to you by our computer program for enrolling that fourth person and it doesn't stop there a fifth person a six person as you continue to keep enrolling new people yes you're gonna earn 20% you level pay from anything they purchase plus the regenerating matrix pay from whatever level they land on but you're also going to have these PS PS these profit sharing positions that earn you another 21 levels each as you can see on your screen and they're unlimited the more people you enroll the more of these PS PS you earn and each new person you enroll as you can see there is on the first level of the PSP that is created by you enrolling them so let's look at how this actually plays out in your matrix so there you are your first position and you enroll 3 people and let's say those first 3 people are your first level just like it's showing there that's pretty easy to understand now when you enroll that fourth person they can't go on the second level because the computer has generated that you number two that PSP for you right above them so the fourth person you enroll khals on your third level with your new PSP landing on your second level right above it let me show you how powerful this is when that fourth person purchases anything as their they're on your third level you're going to get paid to your PSP or you number two because that fourth person is on the first level to that you number two now the first person you brought in if they're qualified they can get paid and you brought in the fourth person they spilled under the first person so they're gonna be happy you just earned them income but you're also going to get paid to your original top position your you number one what does that mean that's double pay you got paid twice from a single sale each product or package purchased by that fourth person or by the team underneath that fourth person is gonna pay you twice that's double pay from the same sales volume and it doesn't stop there your fifth person you enroll that while that you number three that we saw that's right above him goes on your second level same thing with your six now I want to show you something here notice how it's evenly distributed the U number three is under your second person and the U number four is under your third person they didn't just all go under your first person there that means everybody wins this is designed to be the fairest and most powerful system ever created and as you keep enrolling more people there's the u number five underneath the first person you enrolled there's the U number six again back on the under the second person and the U number seven under the third and it just keeps balancing so this what you're looking at on the screen right now is an example of you bringing in twelve people you enrolling twelve people and what just happened there your entire second level is filled with your PS PS you own your second level that means everything that occurs from the third level down all those people you see and anyone that joins the teams of all those people and anyone that falls down they're purchasing products or packages is gonna pay you twice now I do have a question for you what's better than double pay well obviously that would be triple pay so let's pretend you don't stop enrolling with twelve people but you bring in a thirteenth person well what's gonna happen the system's gonna have to generate a u number eleven and there's that u number eleven and it's on your third level which puts the thirteenth person on your fourth level and when that thirteenth person makes their purchase you get the twenty percent you level pay of anything they purchase but what else happens you get paid to you number eleven you get paid to you number two you get paid to you number one because that thirteenth person is in the downline of all three of those positions that's triple pay and I got to tell you folks it doesn't stop there this is one of the most powerful things I've ever seen in business in any business of any kind and that's why we got a copyrighted and no one else can duplicate it so knowing all this the only question I have for you is how many PSPs do you want obviously if you're like me you're gonna want as many as you can get I do know that you're gonna absolutely love how PSPs will multiply your regenerating matrix income and all this happens automatically folks you don't have to do any special work this is all part of the computer program designed to make sure you earn the maximum amount of commissions from whatever sales happen on your team so that's regenerating matrix pay the second way that CV pays out we've gone over unilevel pay and we've gone over regenerating matrix pay so moving on we're gonna talk about the third way called infinity bonus pay infinity bonus pay is for our higher ranks in the compensation plan but I want to let you know there's very easy promotions to achieve the lower ranks we have four different manager positions that you can achieve in week as you're building your CTF Oh business but the infinity bonus pay starts with the 25k vice-president rank and we're gonna look at that right now I just want to show you you earn in addition to everything that we've talked about with you level pay and regenerating matrix pay as a 25k vice president you earn an additional four percent but this is of your entire team CV and that's for an infinite number of levels not just the 21 levels from the regenerating matrix not just the five levels from the you level pay an infinite number no matter how big your team gets as a 25k vice-president you earn four percent of the CV of your whole team and then when you earn the rank of 50k senior VP you get an additional four percent see it says plus four that means you're up to eight percent as a 50k senior VP and then when you were in the rank of 100k executive VP you get another four percent now four plus four plus four is twelve that's 12 percent of your entire team CV for an infinite number of levels and as you can see those are just the first three ranks that earn infinity bonus pay presidential director senior presidential director executive presidential director additional percentages of your entire team CV is paid to you as you earn these increasing ranks and then there's our top rank in the company top gun and there's a top gun pool now everything I've shared with you about the Infinity bonus page is life-changing but the top gun rank and this top gun pool this is generational change it's life changing for generations to come for your family this is an amazing pool it's company-wide it's not just your team it's infinite levels and six percent of the entire company's commission volume is put into this pool and the top guns that achieve this rank share in that percentage equally and as more people achieve this rank it means more volume is created it means that income numbers that are being generated will be astronomical okay like with the other two ways you get paid let's take a knee sample here and look at the potential monthly infinity bonus pay you could earn here as a 25k vice-president you could earn an additional $500 and I want to point out something here the qualification for a 25k vice president that 25,000 is from the sales volume on your team not the commission volume so we make it even easier for you to achieve that position and then when you're promoted to a 50k senior vice president that $500 could go to $2,000 again in addition to all your unilevel pay and your regenerating matrix pay and then as a hundred K executive VP that jumps to $6,000 that's again in addition to the other ways you get paid and I'm just gonna leave there because as you can see with presidential director or senior presidential director executive presidential director as you can see the numbers can just get astronomical and once again for the full details of all our ranks and qualifications you can find them in our compensation plan chart and our compensation plan overview document that are on your free CTF own website and I encourage you to really look through these closely because one of the things we're most proud of is that we have the easiest qualifications and the largest payouts in our industry so those are the three ways that CV pays out very powerful ways you to level pay regenerating matrix pay and Infinity bonus pay and I want to point something out to you here if you total up the unilevel pay it equals 36% and if you total up all the regenerating matrix pay it equals 39% and the Infinity bonus pay told up equals 25% adding those all together that's a hundred percent and I really want to stress here a hundred percent of the CV is paid out from each and every sale mate because we have full compression here at CTF Oh a lot of companies don't do that we've designed this plan specifically to pay out a hundred percent of the CV from every single sale now looking at unilevel pay we call this upfront money this is the money that you can start earning quickly and that can add up quickly but it's not just upfront money it pays you continuously and while that money is building that income is building quickly we also pay you regenerating matrix pay now the regenerating matrix pay potential to really see it turn into the big numbers is more of a one to two year plan but as it continues this can be your true retirement income and then the infinity bonus pay to get into the serious numbers there it may be more of a three to five year plan but this is where you don't just retire you retire wealthy so we put all three of these together and balance them out so that you can receive the maximum benefit from CTF oh and the important thing to remember is that all three of these ways pay you automatically and simultaneously you don't have to worry about it it's created to help you on every step of your

you don't know is the calm cousin of marijuana it's legal it's based from hemp the benefits are it gives you the health benefits of this natural product lots of people use it for anxiety relief pain relief helps focus it's just kind of a calming thing to do you don't need to smoke it like you would a joint the oil is removed from the hemp plant hemp is a part of the marijuana family and um this oil is then inserted into oils so tinctures lotions gummies vape pens some people vape it and taking this oil but by whatever means gives you this feeling of calm or a mild pain relief i personally first fell into cbd when i hurt my back over the christmas period lifting a heavy dining room table because i still thought i was a 21 year old monster of a man that could lift anything and instead i tweaked my 50 year old pack and was wandering around collapsing forward going so i used cbd lotion and uh it was fantastic so now i take the gummies when i'm working it really helps me just to give me a little bit of focus and concentration sales pitch aside that's not why you're here so why are we here right so when i'm setting this shop up on the snug cbd website working on the website itself you can see that the products that appear we have two main types of products one is a simple product here's an example the snug cbd sleep pack and you can see the default for simple products is add to cart because there's one product one price and you want to buy and add it to your cart before you check out we're running woocommerce over wordpress here obviously since this is a wordpress course you'll notice these other products the ones that come with different varieties so for example uh gummies you may end up choosing different options so the button says select options rather than add to cart i just don't like the fact that these variable products have different text it's accurate it's saying select the options then when you go into the product itself you can choose the option in this case it's a 30 count bottle or a 60 count bottle when you're looking at the options it then says add to cart so i see what woocommerce is doing it makes sense however from this main shop page i don't like that it has these different text here there's no way within woocommerce that i could find anyway of changing this select option text so let's do it using a little php code snippet where we basically add a piece of code to the website to say override the default text for this variable woocommerce product type how do we do that okay so first things first let me look at my little code snippet which i have on my other computer here it is oh that's big text i massively made it huge so here's a piece of a php code and what it says is add a filter for woocommerce product types of this text when they're adding to the cart if it's a variable product change the text on the button if it's purchasable to add to cart this piece of text here can say anything you like so this is the piece of text that by default would be saying select options and i want to change select options to read add to cart okay so even if you don't know php just copy and text copy and paste this piece of code from my blog article which will be linked somewhere down here around here and it will make the magic work i'm not going to go into too much detail about the php how do we add this piece of script into our website well it's easy most of you will probably be using um a child theme so if you look in your child theme folder you'll have a functions.php and you can paste this into the functions.php that's the established no overhead on the website way of doing it it's very easy oh no it's not very easy it you've got to ftp onto the site or use control file the control panel there's a much easier way of adding code snippets to your wordpress website and it's using a plugin called my custom functions so let's go and add this plugin so here we are we're going to search for one called my custom functions i think there's a couple of plugins with the same name but i'll show you the one that i like to use it's by space monkey chimpex or something here we are so my custom functions this plugin here by space x chimp i've used this on several websites and it just works it's free works perfectly it's got some nice functionality in there so i'm going to install this plugin one of the nice things about this plugin is you just pop your php code into it and you've got a slider that you can turn on and off to activate or disactivate that piece of php code so you can see it in action so here's my custom functions running i'm going to activate it from this screen here and then we'll go into the plugins option i'm in the wordpress control panel as you can see once this comes back saying it's activated these are all of my plugins now looking down through my plugins here it is my custom functions and it's running so let's go to settings and see what we can do in here how my custom functions work says yes hello space x chimp thank you well pleasure i like this plugin as well we turn it on and off using this slider and then we click save so let's take our piece of text which i had in my notepad you can copy this from the blog article i'm just going to paste it into the body note that we don't need to put the open bracket question mark php and stuff at the beginning and we can put multiple multiple scripts in here you could add this filter add another filter to do something else lots of the times i want to make little changes in the website i'll have a whole bunch of different scripts running on here once you've got this pasted in here's my text that i'm going to replace um i just turn it on and i click save once this is saved my website is slow it's in development i've got all the debugging turned on and all that jazz here it is saved if i go back to my store and i simply do a refresh that script is going to run on the background just before this page is displayed and boom voila all of these buttons have now changed to add to cart it's only for the variable products so if i went into the custom functions and uh let's say that just to show you right if i change that to add to variable and save the changes once that's saved if i go into my shop and refresh it i'd expect to see the add to variable just on the variable products this snug sleep pack should stay there we are you see the variable products are all changing neat right neat super easy to use let me put it back now wait if like me you're a fat sausage-fingered programmer there's a good chance that you're gonna break this script if this script breaks or it's an invalid php script wordpress will poop itself it's a polite way of saying to bed because it's gonna it's gonna say ah there's a php script put into the header and it's all corrupt so let's deliberately break it so here's the script all looking good now if i look at it looking good let's go back in and press refresh i'm expecting to see it just saying add to cart right we know that so when i fresh it here is my add to cart screen beautiful now let's break it let's say that i go in and i put in now we know that's going to be duff right so when i save it i think this will immediately break the website there's poor old wordpress coming back saying i don't the syntax error is a script being injected it's a critical error the website is broken indeed if i go back to the shop page and i refresh here poor oh disaster the whole website's broken what am i going to do luckily there's an easy way to go in and just say right tell this plugin to stop injecting we can't log in we can't go to the admin panel we can't do anything but we can do it using ftp or the control panel so either ftp into your file structure on your website what i'm going to do here is i'm going to use the control panel here's me logged into the control panel on my website so go into file manager this is what you'll see through file manager or through ftp go to the root of your files on your server go into wp content from wp content go into the plugins so we're going to the root the wp content to the plugins here we are we see the files that make up all the plugins on our website there's my custom functions if we go into my custom functions you'll notice a little file down here called start if we just rename this to stop what we're doing is we're telling wordpress at a server level don't run this plugin don't inject this code with the crappy bit line of stuff in there so if i go back into the shop and refresh it i'm expecting to see my shop to come back to standard without that code override running and there it is there's my shop it's back the website's back up and running but it's still got this old select options running on there right so now i can go back to my plugin page and refresh here and i'll now be seeing my plugin script of course the web the plugin thinks it's running but it's not because we've got that stop on there right so the first thing i'm going to do is turn it off and remove this crappy piece of code so this all looks good to me it says add to cart the php looks good i'm kind of happy with how this php script looks itself so i'm going to save it once i've saved it it's still not running because of that stop statement but if i go back into my control panel and i rename that stop back to start it's now running that plugin once again oops so here's my plug-in it's running so again at a plug-in level i'm going to turn it on and save the changes and once that's saved i'll go back to my shop and this woocommerce script will be making changes at a website level wherever it sees select options for variable products it changes them to add to cart there you go it looks a bit nicer this website's coming together as i design and build it i'm generally pleased with it overall now uh what else can i tell you about it if you're going to be adding scripts using this technique through my custom functions it makes it a lot easier than putting it into the functions theme uh child theme sorry i'd highly recommend that you take any script that you have and run it through a php validity checker there's a whole bunch of them out there which one would i use um php code checker is as oops okay there's a problem line a is returning with a zed in front you can always tidy your code up yourself make sure you analyze it make sure you're happy with the script go into custom functions paste it in turn it on if it blows your site up into file manager change the start to a stop fix the script it's neat it's a neat way of doing it it gets a big thumbs up thank you spacex chimp um that's it in the meantime go and buy something from uh snug cbd try it out try out the tinctures little drop you put under your tongue or the gummies which are excellent um or the chapsticks buy your girlfriend a bath bomb and uh i'm gonna add a coupon code to let you guys have a discount over on the website if you enter how about i go in and i'm gonna record another lesson now on how to add coupon codes to woocommerce that's coming up next", "h0SqR_YG34c": "what is up you guys I'm back it's been forever I don't know long story short March and April have just been a doozy and bad that's what matters so I want to thank all of you that are new to my channel because I've had a lot of new subscribers and also all the people that have been here for a minute thank you thank you thank you so much for subscribing to my channel I cannot believe how many people have been watching my CVD video and my lien video um that was not supposed to go the way that it went the first time I did the CVD video that was just more so because a company had reached out and they wanted me to try their products I wasn't paid for it they just sent me the products and I've been wanting to try CBD products anyway so I was like okay I'll do it but that video has taken off and then also the lien video you guys really ripped me a new one with that one that was more so just for fun I like I had no intention of actually trying lean it was a joke it was literally a joke I know that that's not real aim I know that I I was corny I know that I know you guys you guys don't have to like rip me a new one every time you watch the video but thank you to everybody that's been watching it and commenting and supporting even if you're a hater and you're trying to tell me that I'm stupid or whatever you know I still love you I still love you follow follow what I decided to do since you guys love those videos so much I am still gonna do my business videos but those are gonna be more vlog style and I'm just gonna show you more behind the scenes because that's what everyone on my Instagram has been asking for anyway they always keep asking for behind-the-scenes and then I'll of course you guys on here you guys still a lot of you guys would still subscribe for my business stuff so I'm just gonna keep it to business and so I'm just gonna keep it to the vlogs and we'll try to at least one a week showing you some behind the scenes of whatever is going on with my business and then also I'm gonna try to do at least one CBD video a week I have a few products that I've been in trying out so one of them I'm gonna talk to you guys about today and I don't know what I'm gonna call this series yet I don't want to say that I'm like an expert on CBD just yet this is more so like for people that are new to CBD we're here okay we're here like we're doing this together we're trying this out together I don't know what I like and dislike yet I don't know which brands are my favorite so we're gonna figure this out together okay want to make sure that my reviews are actually helpful and not just stupid maybe this will be like CBD Diaries I don't know like I don't know CBD Adventures of Donnie so today I have this neutral hemp CBD and so they have a variety of products and I have a few other product from them that I'm gonna test out and tell you is about later they did not pay me for this either I they did send me the product for free to try I did not agree to like say positive things and I also did not get paid but yet they gave me a few things they gave me like a spray that you can put like an oral spray I guess like almost like a breath freshener or like any other spray you would like spray for medicine I guess because you guys know have you guys ever tried this throat sprays when I was little and I would get sick my mom would use give me those like throat sprays that would help soothe your throat so that's what I thought of immediately when they sent me this I was like oh this is like a throat spray but it's not so this is a oral spray we'll talk about this in in this video and what it does and how it actually works and then they also gave me these anti stress CBD things and these are like aloe it seems like a low dosage yeah these are like a low dosage on the spot you just pop it in your mouth if you're like having I don't know like a panic attack maybe I don't know you need some adult anxiety looks like I don't know yeah so they gave me these I'm gonna see how that works out if I really like it or not and then they gave me like a smaller oral spray that I can use on the go you know just in case my anxiety gets really bad that day I'm just kidding you can use you can use CBD for other things than just anxiety yeah just I'm just being stupid okay so anyways and luckily I don't deal with anxiety like I used to thank God I got is good but anyways but if you do have an anxiety I'm sure that CBD really would help okay so getting it let's get into this product and then I'll expand on that so the products that I'm actually going to be talking about today is their joint cream or it's in joint balm for pain and aches and whatever that you have in your joints this is how many ounces is this 10 ounces no it's one else this is one else this little jar right here I'll put the information in the description like I'm pricing whatever but when it came I was like okay cool so when you open it you guys this is what it looks like okay it's it wasn't even full like this is how it came I barely used that much so like that hold it that you see it comes like that like that it's not full when you get the jar and then also it smells like mr. Lathem I think that's how you say it it smells like old people okay like really medicated like do not wear this do not put this on before you leave the house because you will not smell cute at all this is something you use like before bed or it's gonna be a home in the comfort of yourself it's not something I will put on and then go out wear it because you will not smell that good but long story short what I use this for was I had like a really long day mind you like I said March and April word doozy okay we're still in April it's still a doozy okay like I'm ready for me but I'm not gonna lie like I have some days where I've just been tried and a lot of times when I have stress or anxiety whatever I like I said I haven't had issues with that in a long time but I will say this month this last two months or whatever I've had a little a little flare-up and that's what you at college but so anyways so a lot of times I internalize things and so the stress comes out of my body so after I've had a long day or whatever a lot of times if I have any aches or pains if it's not from working out it's normally because of stress so and I feel it like I literally will feel it on my body like in my back especially and then I'm noticed in this area a lot for me lately and so I was like excited to try this because I thought like you know it'll just help me rest better I just wanted to rest because I when I go to bed after a long day and then I wake up the next day and I don't feel fully rested you know what I mean because it's the tension in my body so I was excited to try this right what I did was I just took this and literally just rubbed a little bit of it and it rubs out really good I will say that like it's a I don't really want to touch it you guys I would do an example I don't want to touch it cause it smells that strong but yes it it rubs out really really well I'll just say that like a little goes a long way I didn't have to apply a whole lot and so I just rubbed it in all the areas that were aching and make sure everything was covered or whatever and then I just slept in something that I didn't mind smelling like this and then I just I noticed after about an hour my whole body felt fully relaxed if that makes sense it didn't take that long for me to start feeling it but I'll say like after hour I was for sure like relaxed I really really liked it you guys I got surprised because I didn't know if I was it was gonna work that well especially because it was like just topical it wasn't something that was taking internally because I I don't know I'm just somebody that believes like you with anything like if I'm ever in pain or whatever I'm always in my mind and I'm like the solution is going to be something that it's at my body before it's outside like every time I use anything whether it's eating pad or whatever to pick something on the outside even with it when it comes to my skin now the answer is never just you know external like I always feel like I need to keep something internal so I was really surprised and this actually worked as well as it did but yeah so if you are somebody that it's like ever dealt with body aches or you just have a lot of stress and tension in your body I would definitely say try this out try this out like like I said the only con is just the smell other than that like I said this dies I'm okay with it because a little goes a long way it definitely works this works this has 200 milligrams of CBD in it I'm still not sure you know completely of like what the different milligram like I course I can tell the difference when it says oh this is 200 versus 900 but I don't know how much of the difference that makes inside and the feeling just yet so I'm gonna compare it because 200 okay that's another thing I want to point out on this oral spray that they gave me the milligrams are 900 so that will actually probably be a good thing for me to test the difference like now take some you know and see how that affected any different versus some of these other things that they sent me because these are a lot these are a lot less these other items that they sent me I definitely love this anyway so that's that's the point of this video I loved this bomb and I want to try more external CBD things and see how that goes I've also been trying this hemp oil on my skin and I'll do like a whole other video on that if you're somebody that's interested in hearing about hemp oil for skincare and clearing your skin if you have acne and all those things so I'll do a video on that and kind of explain how that worked for me so I hope you guys liked this video I hope you guys liked the structure of this one too I tried to make it more informative and really give you more information about the product itself so that you can like actually enjoy it but I want to make sure that it's also fun we might be doing some other fun things with this series ok so just stay tuned I'm all about wellness and making sure that you know mentally you're good as well as like internally and on the last CBD video I did a lot of you guys are pointing out the diamond CBD brand is not good because they lace their CBD with other harmful things so please please please I apologize for even talking about that brand because I had no idea I have no idea at the time and so that really taught me like I need to do more research on those companies and one of you buying anything else from them and I'll be sure to be my research before using or promoting any other brand that you know is CBD like I will do my research and make sure that they are like they have good practices so this brand they are a good brandy I haven't seen anything bad about them just yeah if you didn't see something please let me know in the comments I'm sure you were going to anyway but yeah so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video goodbye [Music]", "miE_54ZDaTs": "hey guys I struggled to upload my last video so it's a couple days behind but it should be up there now this is gonna be my new setting for videos that I feel like are because I recently purchased a new car which people have asked me to make a video on like the whole buying a car dealership process because I ended up getting my car at Carmack's and my first car purchase like with cash so a little bit of a different experience but we'll cross that road when I get there I guess recently I've been using this brand of CBD products the company is called hemp bombs and I have been seeing a lot of progress for the reasons that the purposes that I've been using them for but today I'm just gonna do a little review and you know tell you what happened for the past week and a half yeah but a week and a half now that I've been using them and I really like them I actually recommend them a lot I'm even sending some of them to my mom for her to try them out for about a year two years now actually my mom and I have been using CBD products for our pain I have back pain I've been to the doctor they don't really know what it was one doctor told me that it was scoliosis and another doctor told me it wasn't scoliosis so as of right now I don't have an actual diagnosis for my back pain I just have consistent back pain and sometimes it's spasms so I don't really know what that is about per se but I've been using CBD cream on my back for pain for like I said two years and in those two years I've also my mom has also used them the original brand that I was using is Blue Ridge hemp company and I really do like their products the cream is it's I believe $50 for two ounces it's a little pricey but CVD products are always gonna be pricey and it lasted me a long time I still have some and it's 200 milligrams this one from the hemp bombs company it's called pain freeze and it has it's one ounce with 50 milligrams in here I used it a couple times I gave myself I cut myself like a little bit of this and put it in a container and I'm sending this whole thing to my mom because I still have one and she needs it more than I do and I want to see if she likes it but and the hemp balms bundle there was bad there was these CBD megadose pills that capsules I'm not certain if it tells you how many milligrams are in each one but it says take one to two daily the first time two pops out of here because I have another one but I only took one so far and I'm sending the other three to my mom and yes that was two days ago that was on Monday when I took one and I came to school and I honestly felt so good the entire day I like I said I use it for pain but I also use it for anxiety and I've been noticing that as far as anxiety is concerned I've been a lot calmer and I wasn't even initially using it for any anger issues or any of that but I do suffer with that and it has honestly made me so much more calm and so much less irritated and I don't really know why that is but I do recommend it to people that are easily irritated or anybody who just has any other anger management situations it's a good idea to take it they gave you these gummies this is all in there like starter bundle thing I've only eaten one of these so far that wasn't really the best so I haven't taken any other ones yet but maybe I'll you do another one today and see how it goes it says to take one or two of these as well I think there it comes with five in here and it comes with five and capsules as well so I've just been taking one just to see how one does but I know if you're gonna use it for I guess sleep or more relaxation I guess you could take two this is the e-liquid that was in the bundle it is watermelon flavored and this is what I have actually been using for a while now I got it I got my package over the weekend and I started it last Monday or Sunday or something like that and then like I said I've been using it for a week and a half now every single day I have this is my second time filling this up this vape pen that I got I put the e-liquid in there and this is how I've been using it mostly like I said I haven't really the gummies and the capsules I've only tried them just so I could try them for video purposes and let you guys know how they were because a lot of people have been asking me about it because I know CBD is starting to get more popular these days but I highly recommend the vape pen the e-liquid if you're gonna use it like regularly like if you're somebody who tapes with regularly liquid but you want to try CBD definitely I recommend it the watermelon is really good they have a pineapple that I want to try that's initially what I was going to purchase but then I saw the bundle and it was on Labor Day so they had like some kind of deal and for you to get the entire bundle and that's why I decided to get it and I knew it had the pain cream in there like I said I wanted to send that to my mom so I just got the bundle it the bundle is about $50 with the discount it was like 40 so that really isn't bad because like I said my other CBD cream that I have is 2 ounces but that was $50 they gave me like a student discount or whatever when I purchased that's a good thing about Blue Ridge hemp company they do give you discounts like if you're low income or if you're a student or anything like that they do work with you and I think they give you up to 50% off I'm not certain like I said I purchased it two years ago so their discount policy might be different now but I do recommend that company but I have only tried that one cream which I don't have with me right now but the hemp balms cream I used it twice once when I was having a back spasm because normally when I have back spasms I have a second one and or I just have reoccurring ones all throughout the day or night or whatever but I put the cream on and I didn't feel anything for the rest of the day once I used it before I went to work because sometimes I do have back spasms that work just with lifting things moving things like the way that I move my body sometimes my back gets irritated by that but I put it on before work I went to work I had no problems I was also using the eliquid on my drive to work like I usually use it when I'm in the car whatever and so a combination of those two my back was not hurting as far as anxiety goes the vape pen has been what I've been using for anxiety any time I feel anxious that's what I've been using just to see how it's how it works and I really enjoy it and I recommend it for anybody who just has like I haven't had an anxiety attack or anything but if you feel anxiety coming on I definitely recommend it the gummies like I said they don't taste of us but they do give you that relaxation feel it says um it's complete relaxation overall wellness calm relaxation pain relief alleviating stress a healthier lifestyle and natural sleep the only products that I can say I've used before I went to bed like maybe as firstly for anything has been the vape pen I have vape at night before I went to bed and I have seen that my sleep has been a lot more consistent I have insomnia as well I never really use CBD as a sleep aid I use it more as like a painting but I have noticed that by the end of my day I'm sleepy at a regular time normally I don't get tired and so like 1:00 2:00 in the morning but I've been finding myself more tired at 10:00 at 11:00 which is early for me so I do like that aspect because I've been able to sleep at a more reasonable time and I've been able to sleep more soundly like it's been harder for me to get awake only because I've been sleeping so well lately which is part in part by my new mattress that I got but also I have definitely seen a difference from when I got on the new mattress and then when I got the CBD so definitely recommend that if you're trying to use it for sleep I would say just try to use the capsules and then like maybe take it an hour or so before you're gonna sleep or 30 minutes if you sleep fast and see how that goes and then like see if your sleep is more consistent throughout the night for me personally I haven't like I said I haven't tried it for sleep I should maybe do that and then see how it goes but as far as I have been using it for sleep it has just been the e-liquid which I enjoy what else this cream it's like um I guess it's supposed to be like a gel or something so the pain freeze cream it looks like this it's just like a gel like it's kind of hot right now so it's moving a lot more than it normally does but at regular room temperature it's very stiff you really have to like pour some of it pull some of it out with your hands and it has like a cooling sensation kind of like an icy hot feeling but I really like it has a menthol smell to it but that doesn't bother me and it's very light as soon as you rub it onto your skin obviously you the smell kind of like disappears but as far as it goes I recommend everything in the bundle the gummy bears are not for like they're not gonna be gummy bears that you eat is candy like they're not gonna taste like Haribo or anything they're not good but they do make you feel better so definitely do recommend them for the feeling purposes but the capsules free with me I don't like to swallow pills so I had I poured the actual powder and the capsule out and then I've drank it well I poured into my mouth and then I drank something so that is definitely disgusting but it's medicine so it didn't it's just like a regular pill it doesn't really bother me because I'm more so used to chewing my pills now but if you swallow pills then you'll be fine because you won't really taste it the outside capsule doesn't taste like anything is just the powder and it's really not nasty like it doesn't taste like medicine like if you've ever tasted Tylenol like fit into it it's not that bad it's not on that level but it is it has like a sour feeling like it makes your mouth pucker but it's not bad but I can I said I try I put it I took it before class it was like 8:00 in the morning or so and came to school and I felt relaxed the whole day it's not other relaxed to make you sleepy it's just a more so relaxed like if I wanted to go to sleep I could but I can definitely get through my day usually on Mondays I work but I didn't work this past one day so I didn't have it I didn't really see it from like a standpoint of am I tired at work or anything but when I've been using the e-liquid and I've even the day I used the gummy I went to work and I I didn't see any issues getting through my day or anything it actually makes getting to ride a a lot better because like I said I'm usually frustrated or something throws me off so it hasn't making me feel a lot better like 100% better and I even recommended it to somebody who was asking me do I know of anything that can help them with their irritation and their them being angry recently and they don't really know why that is they just have been having problems like I guess maintaining their anger and I told them you should really try CBD because I have been using it not for that purpose but it has definitely changed the way I have felt about certain situations like I've just been more relaxed more chill I'm normally sure but a lot of things you can't shake me up and I have seen that even the instances that I've been having I've just been cool I've been like whatever like everything is what it is at this point yeah I really do like that so I'm going to get some other flavors of the e-liquid at some point probably when I start getting low of the watermelon one that I have but I do really recommend it this one that I have is 75 milligrams and it's just a regular 16-ounce bottle they sell the really big ones that you would get like at a vape shop but I think those are they have it in 75 and they have it in 250 I believe and then they also have some higher dosages but I was watching somebody else on YouTube review this and they were saying like honestly if you're not using it for cancer purposes there's really no reason to go higher than 250 for just like a regular use and since I was using it for like I said pain and anxiety stuff like that I was like whatever like I was just trying the starter pack if I like their stuff I'll purchase again and like I said I had a cold if there's a code that's active on the website I will put it in the description box so that you guys can use it if you want but I know a lot of people have been asking me about it so that's why I decided to review it but I will put the link in the description box like I said if I find a code I'll at it and I believe they just emailed me a code today like a 10% off or something which I believe they sent everybody after you've made a purchase like they asked you hey do you want to review it and then they give you like a thank-you code or something for shopping with them so I will see how many times I like can use the code and I'll put it in the description box because I'm not planning on purchasing right now because I still have stuff to use so I'll give you guys that code as well and if you have any other questions or any other comments about it how it made me feel stuff like that I wasn't sleepy it doesn't give me like I know some people take other medicines and stuff to get them through the day and then they get drowsy at night this doesn't give you get you drowsy it's just like I said it's just a nice calm relaxation when you get home and you're getting your bed and you want to relax and you want to wind down and go to sleep it's very easy to go to sleep but I'm not gonna say that it made me drowsy it hasn't made me any more tired than my regular school and work schedule exhausts me so like I said I'm gonna give this a 10 out of 10 I recommend it for any irritation irritability stuff like that for anxiety I've seen that it has calmed me down if you have anxiety to the level where you get regular anxiety attacks I would say honestly try it out and see if it calms you down in any way but I don't have my anxieties not up on that level I honestly have to be in a huge situation for me to have an anxiety attack so I haven't really had an anxiety second since last semester so I can't say for that purpose if it hopes or not definitely have felt a lot better in general and my days have just felt like they're easier to get through no back spasms no back pain any of that like I said if you have any comments any questions about the products or whatever shipping time anything else just put it in the comments and I'll get back to you guys as soon as possible I don't really know what I'm gonna film a video next I don't have these things planned out I just kind of do them as people ask me questions but thanks for watching please like and subscribe and I'll talk to you guys soon", "K_ac8R5Fso8": "[Music] let's talk about our CBD capsules our CD capsules come in two formulas and five

"welcome back everybody taking a break from cooking but we've got more delicious recipes perfect for a wintery cold day like today coming up in just a minute but first we're gonna talk to one of the pharmacists from hometown pharmacy JJ Allen from Oshkosh the Oshkosh pharmacy good morning thanks for being here thanks for having me so first before we jump into this topic a lot of people right now are sick with cold and flu and all you know you name it they've got it there's a lot going around you guys are there to help you have a lot of natural supplements that are you guys swear by and you know you're very approachable at Hometowne that's what you guys are all about yes definitely and I think the one thing that we focus on is keeping people well so a lot of our pharmacists are known as the pharmacists that don't like drugs but what we try to do is leverage lifestyle and nutrients first I think one of the products referring to is virus ed with echinacea and elderberry and zinc some things support the immune system that's very popular this times been very very helpful so don't you know don't just think you can handle this alone you know it's always a good idea to go to the pharmacist tell them your symptoms and they can help you you know get something that may help of course always you know if you're not feeling better get to the doctor but you guys were there yes also really quickly wanted to talk about some of the shop go hometown shop go pharmacies how you were going to be filling in that gap yeah so shop Co hometown pharmacy provided a lot of great patient care for a long time unfortunately a lot of them are now going out of business so we've been talking with a lot of the shop Co pharmacists to figure out if there's areas and communities that aren't going to have a pharmacy anymore we're looking to help fill in those gaps there are going to be a lot of communities in the near future we're gonna be filling those gaps that Shopko left but is with a heavy heart that we see them go because I've been great partners for so long but I'm reaching out to those pharmacists to make those fillings where needed and we'll talk more about that as you know the months go on but right now we're gonna talk about something that's a really hot topic right now you may have heard of it you may have seen it on the news you it's called CBD oil so first of all JJ what is it so that's a good question so see is a very very hot topic right now it's something that because it's something that's fairly new that everybody is kind of looking at as a panacea treats kind of everything I'm what we're finding is it's a good tool but a lot of the the research hasn't quite cut hasn't quite caught up to the height so there are things that it's been shown to be beneficial for mainly insomnia pain anxiety and so there are a lot of patients that we use it as a tool but it's not meant for everybody and there is some drug interactions and there is some potential issues with it so the main thing is talking to your pharmacist and doctor before starting any CBD oil and just like everything all different brands aren't created equal so that's really you guys do your research you you know you you get the brands that you believe in you've brought a couple of different ones at different forms so how does it come and you said insomnia and you know that's something I think a lot of us suffer from how would you how would it work yes that's a good question so first with the different brands so the just like the supplement industry the CBD oil in wood industry or now it's kind of the wild wild west it's not regulated like drugs are so with medications like ibuprofen versus Advil I'm always comfortable going with the generic unfortunately for supplements and CBD in particular that's not always the case there's a lot of products out there that don't have what they say they have on the label contain in them and actually can cause a lot more harm than good so first and foremost getting a good quality product the one thing I always that people look for as you can see on this box here it says I'm full spectrum so that all the studies of CBD oil they use the whole plant so it's not the CBD itself it's the whole hemp plant that's been effective for it so looking for the full spectrum and then second looking for certificates of analysis so the company we partnered with is ananda and again our pharmacists nutritionists did a lot of research into these companies to find one that partnered with the university thomas jefferson university that has done some of the most research on CBD oil and they actually have companies saying this is what's in there this is what's not you can actually go online and look up for each product exactly what's in there and that that's huge you know i mean if you're gonna I you better be buying the good stuff the stuff that they've done research on so it comes in a couple of different forms look there there is a you know a dropper like an oil dropper and what is the one in the tin yes so the oil dropper is the tincture that's the most common form that's under the tongue and that's one that it's been shown to have better absorption sublingually then then orally so the tincture is always people start and then the one in the tin is actually a salve there's not a lot of good data for topical use of CBD oil but it is very safe and there has been some people who have shown anecdotal benefits with pain and specific site inflammation for bug bites and things so this one has a topical salve but most of the data has been done on the oral tinctures so the ones under the tongue so you basically do what one or two drops under the tongue and that'll be something to make sure you talk with the pharmacist each person or dosing is going to be different and again yeah it's it's a tool not meant for everybody but most people would be one milliliter or ten milligrams under the tongue but it's gonna vary depending on medications age other disease states so something to work with the pharmacist the nice thing about you know you are in a lot of different hometowns so you talk to your customers have you had customers who you know let's say had you know couldn't sleep or had severe anxiety and they use a little bit of this what have you heard yeah there's some of our biggest success stories are actually people on on chronic opioid medications so a big issue in pharmacy right now is the over prescribing of opioids a hydrocodone and oxycodone so with pain we've had a lot of success with helping people taper off of these pain medications and using CBD oil to help augment that so that's been the biggest success for me and then we've had a lot of people also our goal is always help people decrease medications so decrease medications like ambien and result for them that are ones that are shown to help for sleep but they decrease sleep quality so helping people to leverage something like a CBD oil has been very effective for decreasing medications and improving sleep improving anxiety and getting back to normal function with the no need for medications do you need a prescription at all it's a good question you do not need a prescription for it as long as it's derived from the hemp plant which these products are there's no prescription needed but there is some gray area with it so again you're talking your pharmacist about which products are are legal yeah hometown pharmacies are all over the in the area jjl and of course is at the Oslo keishon but they're really approachable and you know it's like it says hometown like it should be so thank you so much for coming really appreciate it and stay warm with thank you and we'll put all the information and a link to their website on", "UQA1_81RNT0": "so this is my review of CBD effects and this is the 300 milligram wine made in the USA what our CBD it's the it's part of the hemp plant and it's the obvious a you know essentially it has like the most beneficial medical benefits let's put a reason why they want to keep marijuana has a scheduled drug Schedule one drug just like right them what was as addictive as heroin it's as bad here no they use it to treat people to get off heroin it's even better for an individual that's addicted to heroin or opiates then methadone so anyways this is gonna be really quick because there's not allowed to say about this besides this [ __ ] kicks ass three on the milligram bring in and everyone saw how keyed up I was before I'm pretty chill now I mean I'm still like going by at the scene tell them my heart rate they're probably like drop down like 20 beats per per minute you know so I'm probably about you know mine you know probably about still around you know high 80s puts burden be net you know hungry organ 20 while I'm standing still and then when moving around I mean that's why I was just sweating my frickin balls off but uh yeah and it's I don't want to say I feel stoned last feel pretty high and the taste of it it's not horrible but it's not the greatest I'm not too sure what to do with it but you know I didn't put any there's just some residue of oh that's a big juice and egg which is pretty good apply but definitely beat the hell out of this stuff this stuff is you don't waste your money on it and it's it's crap I mean so far this is the only big juice CBD babies that I would even recommend it's the only one because I'm using it and I've tried some and just like for cradle and stuff Oh PMS optimize plant met mediated solutions a real can trade today but uh hey if the MTA is not going to treat me and damn doctors not going to treat me now I'm gonna self-medicate why do you think a lot of us vets become drunks and druggies because we don't get any [ __ ] help but thankfully progressives have made things better for us take care of you safety kind of stay strong yeah love you", "J8iExs0bEYg": "hey guys it's Matthew and Claudia and today we're going to talk about dust CBD and get you high CBD oil to answer this briefly will not thank you hi yeah we gonna explain in this video why and why it's not making you high how can you still get all the benefits from the cannabis plant without actually the adverse high feeling so let's start by telling again that CBD will not make you high even if you take higher dosage there is the big hype about CBD started when people that were suffering from severe epilepsy seizures were taking CBD they found that CBD really calms him down and helps some of their seizures and they were taking as much as 400 I believed all the way to 800 milligrams of CBD per day and if you done your research that's a lot if you've done your research you know there's 1215 milligrams of our local just like we have here in the background our CBD leaf right out CBD oil is 1250 milligrams that means the entire bottle here 30 million years has exactly 1250 a little bit more actually we over delivered a little bit more than 1250 milligrams of CBD so they were taking almost the entire bottle every single day to help them with seizures and that is showing you that CBD is very safe and it will not make you high yeah there's a lot of people that don't really mind getting high but there's also a lot of people and we are also one of them that don't really tolerate being high and we just don't like that feeling we don't respond well to it that's why CBD is perfect for all of the people that don't want to feel you know high any psychoactive effects exactly and I even did a test I fasted for 20 hours and it took one full dropper which was around forty five milligrams of full-spectrum CBD and I did the anti marijuana test that I bought at CVS mm-hmm and they came out negative and I did it I think one hour after or thirty minutes after that so it definitely shows you that CBD is safe but why is it not making it high simply because CBD to be legal sold legally in all 50 states like US has to have less than 0.3% of TAC and THC is the compound of the cannabis plant it acts directly on our CB receptors in our body that are psychoactive and it gives you high it gives you the body high gives you the mind high depends on what you were thinking but CBD has has less than 0.2% of that company won't even feel it you won't even know you want to keep the entourage the fact that we said you still won't have all the compounds from that plant and it's only in the full spectrum CD because you also have broad spectrum and isolate and isolate isolate is like 95 I would say percent of CBD because everything else is extracted there's remove everything then you have pros broad spectrum CBD where you have removed THC is removed so if you for example work where you have to get tested like daily were like once a week that's the safest part for you as Matthew said he got tested but I'm not sure ever endocannabinoid system it's different different and you're gonna exact it your Texas problem in their logins that it might be done and I thought I said as well some people like to get high so they can consume CBD has THC as well but actually CBD comes down the high affect as well so if you take if you wanna if you think or your doctor or someone college of THC by help you especially for cancer patients THC might work better for them for pain and etc they take one on one ratio so they take let's say ten milligrams of THC and ten milligrams of CBD and they'll not get that high because CBD comes down those psychoactive in fact yeah that's not actually a fun fact that if you overdose with THC you can take so you can take CBD and that calms you down exactly just like yeah yeah yeah but going back to the broad spectrum and a full spectrum they removed us Thu from the broad spectrum but use the whole entourage effect so only with full spectrum CBD you get like the whole entourage effect from the whole cannabis plant but you don't get high exactly so you get the benefits like improved sleep less inflammation reducing xiety and you won't get high so hopefully that answers the question if you have further questions comment below or email us and get find us on instagram at leaf route we'll be more than happy to answer your question and get to know you better yeah see you next video", "16zJMWMnORU": "[Music] good morning Liberty it is Wednesday morning June 19th 2019 my name is Michael Bolden broadcasting to you live from my home office in studio here in downtown Los Angeles for the Tenth Amendment Center we multicast our stream live every Monday Wednesday Friday at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time you can find all of our archives and the podcast version of the show over at Tenth Amendment center.com good morning Liberty otherwise if you're watching live whether it's on YouTube Facebook D live twitch periscope wherever or if you're watching in the archive I really appreciate you spending some time with me today on this episode we're gonna talk about the latest status legal I guess legal status I put legal in quotes of CBD under federal law and regulation a lot of people tell me over and over again like oh hey Bouldin you know this CBT stuff it's it's everywhere so it must be legal I can find in the store I can buy it online I can have it shipped across state lines so it must be legal but this is absolutely not the case and the FDA just held its first public hearing at the end of last month I think it was on the 31st of May something like that to discuss what they're going to do to regulate and control this market they're basically behind the ball and trying to get their little grips on it right now but it is illegal according to the FDA in most situations but yet we find it all over the place now normally I would go right over into the live chat and say hello to everybody I am saying a quick kind of broad hello to everyone I appreciate you spending some time with me wherever you are joining us whether it's live or in the archive but I do have to cut the episode a little bit shorter than what I normally do on the Monday and Wednesday shows which are the longer ones Friday is 10 to 15 minutes usually but I'm going to cut this one a little bit shorter than normal because at 10 a.m. my time so in than a half-hour I'm recording an episode of the Tom woods show back on that show for a first time in quite a while pretty excited about that with Michael from Libertarian Party Mises caucus this morning so I want to cut this one short so I can have time to make sure I've got everything set up and ready to go to talk with Tom but look for that interview in the near future I think he usually publishes them a few days later at Tom woods calm so let's get right into this first of all I want to reference one episode that I did right at the end of last year because this so-called farm bill I guess we could probably call it the Food Stamp bill rather than the farm bill because that's really what it does after they passed the farm bill everyone was telling me oh they legalized hemp so now CBD is legal as well well I covered that in full detail on an episode on December 28th what's next for hemp and CBD after the farm bill I will make sure that that link is in the show notes archives over a 10th amendment center.com slash good morning Liberty if you want to jump over and watch it now if you're on youtube you've got the link accessible to you now but the short version is that even though they legalized or decriminalized industrial hemp in that bill they have a specific exception to it which makes it so it isn't at least on CBD but let's let's look at a few other things first of all again people always tell me that CBD is available everywhere and here's this article from Forbes according to research the market is anticipated to reach 20 billion in sales by 2024 even my own brother at some point he was out here visiting recently on some business and we hung out a little bit and he was saying how can this be illegal how can this not be a legal substance like people are making billions of dollars on this and I think to me that is an example of how nullification works nullification is really effective even if people don't realize that what they're doing is nullifying when there's enough people enough states enough businesses all willing to do things that the federal government says that they're not allowed to do you end up with 20 billion in sales by 2024 they say from candies to cosmetics see is expanding to new product categories for example Ben & Jerry's just announced its plan to launch a CBD infused ice cream once CBD is legalized at the federal level so Ben and Jerry's recognize isn't part of it and they're not going to cross that line I think some of the larger manufacturers are staying or larger companies are staying away from it because that's maybe a little bit more risky or they're they're more risk-averse in their business and then they go on and say it currently 47 states have legalized CBD for human use according to the Consumer Reports I'm not sure if that number is actually correct I think it's actually a little bit lower but it's a significant part of the country that is saying you can do this and this other report that I saw at marijuana moment led me to tsa.gov supposedly the TSA is now letting people have CBD on the flight and the short version is they basically updated their policy and if you're watching the video now I've got the TSA policy here for medical marijuana they consider CBD either medical marijuana or if it has a certain THC level or above if it's below it it's an industrial hemp product but the industrial hemp product is still regulated by the FDA and they say this marijuana and certain cannibal cannabis infused products including some cannabidiol CBD oil remain illegal under federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3% THC or that are approved by the FDA th TSA officers are required to report any suspected violations of law to local state or federal authorities well which ones which and how does it qualify basically what the TSA does is they've made a statement that says we are not trying to stop people from getting on planes because they are carrying CBD but it is up and it says here at the bottom I can't even scroll up high enough it's as quote the final decision rests with the TSA officer on whether an item is allowed through the checkpoint so people are getting a little bit confused they see a report that says the TSA is now allowing it basically that TSA is turning a blind eye they're reiterating that the FDA has control over this and I'll get into a little bit more detail on that in a moment and at the same time they're leaving it to the discretion the TSA agent what they're gonna do now if they want to say this thing is illegal if that particular agent says this is illegal we're not gonna let this person through what they would do is they would turn them over to local law enforcement and now with local law enforcement because 47 states supposedly I'll have decriminalized or legalized CBD if local law enforcement doesn't actually have any criminal activity or criminal charges for someone carrying CBD then local law enforcement does nothing maybe the TSA just makes you throw it out I just flew with TSA well lax is a different story but back and forth to Milwaukee I flew with some CBD products back and forth and had no problems I mean I just laid it out in the cart because whatever I mean if they're gonna throw out a couple of gummies it's gonna cost me a few bucks but it helps me sleep or relax reduce some anxiety through travel which is a horrible experience so the confusion is all these different things are happening so therefore it must be ill it must be legal and Mike Meharry in his article that I'd like to cover here points out that this isn't the case and just a quick reiteration of what was passed in this so-called farm bill and he writes with the passage of the farm bill the federal government now treats industrial hemp as an agricultural commodity instead of controlled substance and because CBD which it comes from a number of places but it is most commonly extracted from the resin of the flower of the industrial hemp plant which is not the marijuana plant for lack of a better term they're cousins cannabis plants different types of cannabis plants the marijuana version has high THC or can be bred to have very high THC and the hemp is used for clothing for rope for oil for food granola and soaps all kinds of other things and then you can also get this CBD this compound from the the flower the resin of the flower and so people think oh well industrial hub is decriminalized and this comes from the industrial hemp plant in most situations so therefore it must be legal quick reopen this while the DEA Mike rights no longer has the authority to regulate hemp the provisions of the farm bill have no bearing on FDA rules and regulations regarding CBD in fact a section of the farm bill makes this explicit they say specifically regulations and guidelines affects another law states quote nothing in this subtitle shall affect or modify the federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in other words the so called Authority for the FDA now mind you I believe the FDA shouldn't exist under the Constitution the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act shouldn't exist under the Constitution but under the people with guns the way that they read this the people who passed the law specifically said we're going to decriminalize or legalize hemp unless it's CBD and then we're kicking the can over to the FDA and here's what the FDA had to say about this is their overview they just published this on June 14 so five days ago this is an overview of the hearing the first public hearing that they had on CBD late last month and this is an overview it of it they say quote on the state level some jurisdictions have eliminated certain prohibitions on cannabis or cannabis derived compounds on the federal level the agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 the farm bill removed cannabis and cannabis derivatives that are very low in THC from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act at the same time that legislation specifically preserved the FDA's responsibilities over such products so the FDA is reiterating what the farm bill says they are now the ones that determine whether or not a CBD product is legal or not and they say as these law other laws have changed and as more cannabis products come to the market whether lawfully or otherwise this is in their own statement there I don't think they really want to say there's billions of dollars flooding the market it's totally illegal because they're gonna look like an incompetent they're gonna look like what they are so they just kind of hint that you know there might be some products that are not lawfully on the market they say the FDA's role is becoming more practically relevant to many effective stakeholders so the FDA is now reiterating just last week or I guess late last week that would've been last Friday that they have authority over CBD and they also go through some of the ways they have so-called authority over this they say for example if a product is being marketed as a drug meaning for example that it's intended to have a therapeutic effect such as treating a disease then it's regulated as a drug and it cannot generally cannot be sold without FDA approval so anyone who is selling CBD and making a claim that it treats something doesn't matter what it is insomnia anxiety inflammation as soon as they say that on the packaging on their website on the label whatever it may be FDA says this is a drug and there's only been one drug approved called epic dialects it's a CBD isolate it's not the full natural version basically from a plant and it costs thirty-two thousand dollars a year thirty-two thousand dollars a year compared to like maybe twenty dollars a month for the same dose if you get it from the plant version from a lot of these manufacturers so they're basically saying as soon as it's marketed soon as someone markets this as being able to treat something then it's a drug and it's totally illegal unless unless the FDA goes through or less they go through millions and millions of dollars of research and clinical trials that the FDA approves multiple phases long time so anybody who's got a CBD product that makes soon as they make that claim it's it's an illegal drug they also say quote food including dietary supplements is regulated differently but with the same overarching goal of protecting consumers I don't think they're protecting anybody but the people who want to charge thirty two thousand dollars for a fifty dollar product to be honest with you and they say among other things it is currently illegal so even if you don't make a claim that it has therapeutic effects that it acts like a drug it treats something soon as you put it in a food or dietary supplement which is basically everything else I think it that can the most difficult gray area is when it's in Beauty and cosmetic products but I did another episode on that and I don't believe that the FDA sees those as legal either but there's just so much of it happening that they're just trying to kind of drill down on certain parts of it so soon as it's marketed as a food or a dietary supplement I get it in my coffee cold brew coffee with CBD in it you can get it in teas you can get it in all kinds of stuff at least here in California I mean I'm not sure how available when I was in Milwaukee a couple or last weekend was it last weekend I went for my nephew's graduation so I apologize Pierce if I don't remember the exact day there was a whirlwind man so when I was there we went to a little health market in in in their neighborhood and they had all kinds of stuff chocolates and other foods that were available in Wisconsin as well but soon as you do this it's illegal because according to the FDA it is quote currently illegal to put into interstate commerce of food - which CBD has been added or to market CBD as or in a dietary supplement period and we know how they view interstate commerce basically anything in the marketplace affects interstate commerce so therefore they see it all as under their control now they've even started to issue warning letters on these and there's a whole page on the FDA website talking about how they're sending out and they're only I don't know how they're picking which companies to target with these warning letters but there's a few that are sent out every month I don't know why it doesn't format but when I have it at this size I can't see the full list but I did pull up one - nutria pure LLC this was sent out in March and this is the letter the claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under this section because they are intended for use in the diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease and or talking about being specific here they are not being very clear and or because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body basically if you sell CBD on your website and they take products for quote hemp oil that contains CBD and CBD soft gels and because supposedly this works doing something and they say this on the website then the FDA says this is a drug and they go on and they say as explained further below introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act they give a link to the FDA website not to the Act itself but they give all these different sections of the federal act and so they're warning people you're what you're doing you're selling this this is illegal and then they go on for people who try to do an end run and say well it's a we're not gonna market it as a drug I know like some of my friends in the health freedom world what they'll do when they're talking about things for example like on a youtube show they'll say well we're not making any claims about what this product does and that's generally the end run around being targeted for marketing an illegal drug or a non approved drug according to the FDA you just don't make claims about what it does you can have someone else talk about it like for me it does this for me CBD and since I don't sell the product I say for me it works great for inflammation after I run I have a very sore ankle or a sore knee I take a little bit CBD v or two and a half milligrams and it helps reduce the inflammation far better than something like Tylenol which is incredibly incredibly bad for my liver so a lot of people say well we're just gonna mark it as a dietary supplement we're not gonna make any claims about what it does but the FDA takes it to one another level and they go in this letter and the the varying letters to different companies are about the same they say although you market hemp oil and CBD soft gels as dietary supplements FDA has concluded based on available evidence that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under these sections so they've got this these exception under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that that basically say if you just market it as a dietary supplement and you make no claims about what it's going to do people can make their own choice on their own then you can sell this stuff but they have specifically said that CBD does not qualify to be marketed as a dietary supplement because it has gone through multiple steps of clinical trials for this at the dialects so as soon as someone started making it for an fda-approved drug then there's no more dietary supplement selling allowed because some company that wants to sell for thirty two thousand dollars a year I'm not sure if anybody's even buying that which is absurd they say there is an exception if the substances substance was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were Ofra were authorized however based on available evidence FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product epidemics as soon as the company started doing that and the FDA accepted it for clinical trials and tests and then approved it as a drug that no one can sell it as a supplement so they held this hearing to determine whether or not they could make an extra exception and they had maybe like a hundred different industry experts come out and testify on this in a public hearing and here's how let's see what Mike had to say on May 31st the FDA held its first hearing on CBD after the meaning the same questions remain as before will the federal agency continue to maintain its current regulation and prohibition of hemp derive can a banana Benoist or will it give into market forces and open the door for general sale and use of CBD and he points out that the hearing that they had just last month did not result in any kind of policy change but as widely seen is the first step toward a comprehensive regulatory scheme I love that he called it a scheme for the CBD for CBD what that will look like remains to be seen and like I said there was around a hundred industry experts that testified and almost all of them and I'm not sure what kind of industry experts there weren't any Austrian economists clearly there weren't any libertarians there weren't any constitutionalist because every single person was basically calling on the FDA to institute regulations rather than just say you know what forget it we're not gonna touch this we don't anything to do with it we're gonna say it's a free-for-all go ahead I think this isn't our job we shouldn't exist that will never happen from the FDA basically what they have now is an open comment period because they're going to issue regulations on CBD we don't know if they're going to make an exception on CBD I think the the comment period is going until July 2nd or so I'm not sure exactly one but they have an open comment period where people can submit information online or submit paper for or against regulation of CBD and then the FDA will take that into consideration and make a choice on how they're going to treat this product and we'll know in the next few months whether they consider it fully illegal like they do today or if they recognize that the market is already filled with billions of dollars worth of this product and then maybe they just try to clamp down and only support the big companies that are doing it I'm not sure how that's gonna play out and mike puts it this way and i think this is really the most interesting part of it all he says even with both the FDA and DEA theoretically enforcing federal laws and regulations banning CBD state and local action have already nullified federal prohibition and practice and effect there's no reason to think that won't continue as long as states maintain the same stance on CBD as they did back in 2014 simply put the feds lack the personnel and resources to crack down on CBD even if the FDA wants to and I'm pretty certain based on the statements that I read that they absolutely want to but will they be able to do anything about a market that's this large this fast I've heard some people say it's the fastest growing product in the I guess we'll call it alternative natural medicine or healing realm in history they've never seen something take off this quickly will the FDA be able to get their grimy hands on it I'm certain they're gonna try but as Mike puts it if enough people continue to say no do what they want if the market continues going forward markets are stronger than government anyways I do have to cut it short like I mentioned earlier because I'm gonna in a few minutes here I got a record an interview with Tom woods I'm pretty excited about that keep an eye out for that I hope you found this interesting educational fun to watch all

again today I'll see you next time on Friday and have a great day", "uOEo9CAoUog": "hi this is Catherine certified nutrition consultant with Boots I heal you and food to kill you CBD and today I'm going to talk about how did they CBD hemp oil and I'm going to cover a lot of questions then I'm receiving through Facebook and through email to help you decide what method might be best for you answer questions like how long do I inhale how often do I do the vaping what strengths do I need is it safe do I inhale into my mouth or my life and try to cover a lot of these questions in this one video and not make it ridiculously long okay so they don't bore you alright so let's start with the two type two different types of vaping systems we'll start with that okay so I have here the vape shot the vein shot and it comes in a starter kit if you check out my website which by the way I'll have a link below this video to my website and the Facebook page but basically this is a kit so you get the battery and it's partially disposable because you get a battery and you get a little charger USB charger so you got your battery charger when you receive it in the mail let me look which end when you receive in the mail you're going to charge it up 30 to 45 minutes initially and then you'll have your cartridge will come in a little package there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this little one milliliter so it's very potent and surprisingly it lasts quite a long time but this is disposable so you vape until you've run out of liquid you throw this away and then you get a new one and you put it on here so you put them what you you twist it on here you've a bit until it's gone throw this away now one of the nice things about the disposable cartridge is that if today I want the mint flavor and tomorrow with the citrus all I have to do is switch this out for a different flavor that's kind of handy you can't do that with the refillable the other things that not is it's nice is you don't have a messy tank here that you're trying to refill and you don't want it to leak leak I found with the refillables they leak now not all there's I have found a good pen according to customers anyway a good pen that doesn't link but anyway so the difference here is that this cartridge doesn't come apart you don't refill it you cannot refill it you just throw it away buy a new one get citrus cush or mint and okay it's real simple now this is a newer system that we have now it's a C cell battery which is a higher quality battery and the vaping is wickless so it's a higher quality vaping it's a really nice vape okay I'm going to go ahead and switch over now to the refillable and then I'll go through how to do this how much you need and all those details okay so the second type I have here is refillable and I have a video on this it's pretty old video but you get the liquid and this this is what we have on our website is we have mint push or citrus this is the liquid again just like with the vape shot our liquids have no propylene glycol no THC no artificial flavorings everything is natural and safe and actually healthy okay it's going to reduce inflammation it's not going to contribute to your inflammation or whatever you might have going on ok so what you do with this liquid is you get a pen I usually reckon this is a refillable pen and I'll just explain this in a second but I recommend that you get one from a local shop like down the street or something because if you have troubles with it which I've had problems with this one you can take it back and they can fix it or replace it real easily but you want to make sure first of all that you get a pen that vapes CBD not nicotine if you try to put CBD liquid in a nicotine pen you will likely clog the pen so you want to CBD pen that's the first thing now with a with this type of system you're going to have a battery and then you're going to have a tank that you refill so you take this tank apart you don't throw it away like with the cartridge in the vape shot you keep it you're gonna twist this off here and it can get kind of this particular system not crazy about this kangertech isn't like I said I've had trouble would you take this out you refill it you put this back in you know you charge the battery as needed I usually have to charge batteries about once a week put it back together and you're ready to vape ok so that's how the refill the works now some people love this if you think it a good pen this is really a nice system to put this vape liquid in I have a link if you go to my website I have a link to a pen that some customers have recommended that I recommend for people because they've had really good luck with it this is what our Facebook community page is all about sharing what works for people what doesn't work whatever and it's called a candy pen Ruby are you bi so if you go to my facebook page I'm sorry my website which will be below this video go to my website go to the page where you see the vape liquids and I have a link that says buy vape pen it'll take you to their website if you don't want to get something at a local shop or you don't have a local shop that's another option you can try their pens right there they look really nice actually they have got a little pod you refill it you put it in it looks a lot simpler than this okay so that's the second type is the refillable now which one's best for you well it depends on I depends really preference okay cuz it's both the same THC free PG free vape liquid same flavors the vape shot is going to be five to seven times it's either 5 or 7 times stronger I think it's 5 times stronger then the refill liquid so there is you can see you can get different strikes now this could be confusing because you're like well this is just a teeny amount of liquid how could it possibly be stronger if it's like 250 milligrams and then refilled was 500 well look at the amount of liquid here that 500 is diluted a lot in here the 250 is not diluted much in here at all so you don't need much of this so if you're a person who just wants to relax and vape often throughout the day but you don't need a high content of CBD then the refillable is great because you can just vape a lot of it because you have you know there's more liquid to go through alright hope I'm not confusing people I'm try to make this easier and more clear I like the vape shot because easy you can just throw away the cartridge get new cartridge but I definitely know that there are some people who really like the refillable that's why I wanted to cover that with you alright so let's move on to how do you do this alright so you're gonna inhale we count to like two or three and then exhale you don't have to hold it in your mouth you can either up hold you can either when you inhale keep in your mouth or your lungs so you can inhale it into your mouth or your lungs but you don't have to hold it to get the effect and you don't have to end into your lungs to get the effects you will get a higher absorption rate in if you inhale in your lungs but you don't have to I've been vaping for two years and I do not inhale into my lungs and I get great results so it will absorb through the capillaries in your mouth you don't have to inhale in your lungs either way that's perfectly safe in your if you inhale in your lungs or keeping your mouth that's perfectly safe either way so you can basically count to two or three and then exhale it right away and I'm gonna demonstrate here right now now I like with this new vaping system you get a lot more vape if you notice I don't know if you have the old vaping system I didn't get as much vape out of the old vaping system this new vaping system like I said has a better higher-quality battery higher quality of hardware the liquid in it is the same that you've always had but the hardware is a better quality so I counted to about three inhale and then I blew it right out how often you do ok so you can vape like three times in a row succession the reason you don't want to do more than three times right in a row is because this coil here can't get hot and you don't want to burn out your coil that's the reason that you're doing three inhales in a row and then set it down for a couple minutes let it cool off if you don't notice any effects that you are the effects you're looking for in five to ten minutes you should notice something in like five minutes if you don't get the results you're looking for or you notice a little bit especially people having panic attacks you might need to repeat okay so after five minutes if you still have some anxiety for example go ahead and do it three more times so you're gonna do this based on need everybody is different I literally have a gal who can only do one inhale and that's all she needs if she did more than that they would it then it would be too much so you don't want to waste your money you know you if you only need one puff or three puffs a day then that's all you need but I will say that the effects are quick fast-acting on set with the vaping high efficacy which means a high percentage of the CBD gets into your system but it's not a long-lasting effect so if I vape right now it might last two or three hours and I might need to do it again and then you do it again so as you can see there's a huge experimentation that you need to do to find out what's gonna be best for you how much you need how often and the easiest way to determine that is try it give it three puffs or if you're if you're very sensitive to things give it one puff see how you feel after five minutes if you feel calmer then you're good to go if you need three puffs and you're calmer five to ten minutes later you're good to go and then wait until you notice that your symptoms come up again and then go ahead and vape again now I would say on average like maybe three times a day that's just to give you a ballpark okay and then the average length of time that this liquid here will last for people people ask how long is cartridge left it's gonna give you about 250 to 300 puffs and the average is about 4 weeks that's the average some people get eight weeks out of it some people get two weeks out of it but the average is gonna be about four weeks maybe longer I know for me it lasts at least four weeks cause like I said a little goes a long way so let's see I cover it a nail in your mouth or your lungs how often you do it this strength now people get really confused about the strength because you can get for example a lot of refillables or even the cartridges different strengths you have to keep in mind a how much liquid will always look in the ingredients always always always make sure there's no propylene glycol in there because I have people contact me who are having allergic reactions to the propylene glycol that stuff is not healthy I know a few years ago when I first started the liquid I tried had propylene glycol and I would get a scratchy throat so that is not you know any allergies or sensitivities and it bothered me so be careful make sure there's no propylene glycol make sure there's no artificial flavorings our vape liquids this one and in the vape shot we use plant terpenes for the flavoring so it's a plant you're getting the flavoring from the plant and so it's totally safe totally pure THC free so make sure that when you're getting a liquid you the ingredients are private priority over the strength of then you can look at is it 100 milligram 300 500 whatever hours are 500 which is quite high for refillable vape liquid cuz we used to carry 50 milligram 100 milligram 300 but we just went ahead we have 500 milligram available now because the lesser milligrams they're just they're more for the person who just wants to do the vaping recreational like 50 milligrams might be more recreational you're not gonna get a lot of therapeutic I should say I get I guess I could say therapeutic effect or benefit from it whereas with 500 milligram or your 250 milligrams a shot you're going to get a more therapeutic benefit or result from it so I guess with the strengths it's really going to be again experimental I can tell you that with the 253 puffs usually does it for people with the 500 you're gonna need to do more vaping because it is a lower concentration so don't be fooled it's hard to compare it can get really tricky when you're looking at you're gonna look on the website me like well 250 500 500 stronger that's just not the case you have to look at the amount of liquid okay I hope that I made that kind of clear if you have more questions jump on our Facebook page I'll have a link below this video or email me at Katherine at foods that he'll you calm I hope I covered everything he needed I know this videos kind of long I hope I didn't bore you that's a nice thing about video you can fast forward if you don't want here at all alright so I'll see you in the next video thank you thank you guys for watching", "RfMgBcNh0LM": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the Charlotte's Web hip extract liquid capsules that come with 25 milligrams of CVD so these Charlotte sweat liquid extract filled capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD in each capsule this is a really great option for those of you looking to supplement with CBD but perhaps you don't really love that earthy flavor commonly found in most tinctures the recommended dose is one capsule and that is a pretty strong dose if you are

before we go too much further about Charlotte's Web and these awesome liquid caps don't forget to Like and subscribe to the Green Valley nation channel and also check us out online at Green Valley nation.com where you are going to find the industry's best non-biased reviews on all of the CBD products and even more importantly you get the education you need to be able to make the most informed purchasing decision so again Green Valley Nation comm go check it out and read the rest of this review Charlotte's Web claims to be the number one hemp manufacturer in the United States by market share that's a pretty big claim to fame however they have been in this game since 2011 they have tinctures capsules like these gummies and even pet products they contain full spectrum products and they also create they've also created some isolate products as well the majority of their products are co2 extracted however they do have one line their original formula that is alcohol extracted however at this time you can only get that with a prescription like from your laughter so each of these capsules contain 25 milligrams of a full-spectrum CBD something that's really cool about Charlotte's Web is that they are US hemp Authority certified and they are C GMP certified as well they made a 98 on their most recent audit which basically tells you and me that these things are created and manufactured in a really nice facility cGMP good manufacturing processing that's kind of like a grading score that they even give pharmaceutical compounding facility so the place that is making your prescription drugs that they are held to the same standards as these Charlotte's Web manufacturing so basically you know every single time you take one of these capsules whether it's from this bottle or your next you're going to get the exact same result because you're going to have a very very very almost identical basically product it's a really good indication of Charlotte's Web dedication to quality and making sure we get the absolute best CBD supplement now you're probably looking at this thing and saying okay what's in it that's the really cool thing inside this box you'll have a bottle that has 30 capsules inside each capsule is just the hemp extract and olive oil it is a vegetarian capsule so it's a these are vegetarian vegan friendly actually these are also non-gmo and they are currently evaded available in US Canada Brazil and in certain places inside the UK depending on availability I kind of get the impression that our friends across the pond may have a bit of a problem maintaining inventory levels so you guys definitely make sure to call the retailers to make sure it is in stock okay now we're going to talk about the test results I'm so excited to be up here and tell you about these new test results that Charlotte's Web is giving out this is actually a brand new product it is replacing these extra-strength capsules this was last year's version of their capsules and this is this year's and I'm super excited to tell you that unlike last year's version of the COAS which basically just told you how much CBD and how much see isn't it and nothing else these new test results actually disclose so much more in fact you find out that there's 0.11% THC which is definitely an illegal mountain grounds and you can see that there's C B G and C B C as well as the CBD that's kind of giving you a big idea of the full spectrum effect that you can expect to get when you take this product because you're getting more than just the CBD another really cool thing about the test results is that they show that it passes for both microbials and pesticides now what does that mean that means that in this test in the test for this batch in particular there were no signs for pesticides and microbials which makes me feel pretty good because I'm not putting you know yucky stuff in my system the one thing I will tell you about the Charlotte's Web Co is is it's kind of like a treasure hunt to get to it I do appreciate the fact that Charlotte's Web is now putting the lot number on the bottom of the box in addition to putting it on the bottom of the bottle and it's in your packing slip the way that you access the COA is you click on you use this QR code however if you don't want to use a QR code totally okay make sure you check out the written portion down below or on our website at Green Valley nation.com and you can get the direct link to the batch results and we will even have a copy of these COAS in our review so now you're probably wondering what is it like to take these so if you're anything like me I was a little bit worried because I really liked the capsules that came before the extra strength capsules these are like a dry form and you might actually still see a few of these in stores near you is a powder in the old one these are liquid filled so it's using an olive oil as its carrying base and so I was very worried that it would leak or that it would cause me to have some indigestion and then there we go I have that natural flavor of the CBD but luckily as you can see that's why I wanted to keep it inside the box there's not been any leaking which is awesome other liquid-filled capsule had and the studio have leaped a bit and I haven't gotten any of that nasty actor flavor so that's pretty awesome as well another really great thing about the liquid craps is that there's 25 milligrams of CBD in last year's model there was only 18 milligrams of CBD so it's actually increasing the total amount of the cannabinoids CBD in these capsules I have been taking the Charlotte's Web capsules I started out with the extra strength a little over a year ago and I just got these into the studio within the last within the last month and so I can tell you that I still absolutely love taking these pills they help me to stay focused they reduce my chronic pain I have pain in my low back and like in my feet and they really do help me to sleep they don't make me sleepy but if I take it before bed I can go to sleep and they will help me to stay asleep all night which as a busy mother of two and entrepreneur is very important so now you probably want to witness me take it keep in mind these are vegetarian like vegetable pulao most they're not plastic but they sort of do feel like plastic so if you have trouble swallowing capsules definitely make sure to have some water I usually don't need a capsule to take one of these you just kind of pop it in and go but it does take about thirty minutes as much as much as an hour to start feeling the effects which is a little bit different than a tincture so here you go bottoms up are you ready to hear my top three reasons why you should try this Charlotte's Web 25 milligram liquid fill capsules number one is that these capsules work the 25 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD it totally helps to reduce all of my pain in my back and in my feet and it helps me to stay focused oftentimes CBD supplements can make me get really sleepy and so I don't love to take them during the day these Charlotte's Web capsules I can take one capsule in the morning it takes away all my pain and even better I get just the point where I can focus you know like the days before social media focus like I could go 90 minutes and I haven't even looked at my phone it's really great to help me reduce pain and it also helps me to get and stay focused I also really really loved the fact that well frankly that it's a capsule I don't love the flavors of a lot of the tinctures they're very very earthy I love that term by the way because I don't know what that means it they don't necessarily taste that great and so the capsules give me the ability to get my CBD supplement and without any of the shall we say more natural flavors commonly associated with CBD supplementation now you're probably wanting to know the but part here's the buck part Charlotte's Web is a premium product that means you're going to have to pay a little bit more for it these actually come in at about three dollars a capsule US which is a little bit over market price however Charlotte's Web is an industry leader they do have the number one market share and they are manufactured in a professional pharmaceutical grade facility so you know exactly what you're going to get that's basically my biggest complaint is that it is a little bit more expensive the packaging it's come a long way from the where it was last last year when it was just black and white it was really kind of hard to see things now that we have this nice gold color it's really really easy to tell exactly how much CBD is on it but it's still not super easy for you to figure out where the co-pays are thankfully they're now adding the lot numbers on both the bottoms of the box and the bottle but if you don't have the website to look in that number and if you don't know how to use the QR code you're kind of like alright how do I get there so keep those two things in mind when you are considering purchasing the Charlotte's Web 25 milligram hip extracted liquid capsules well that's it for me you guys I hope you enjoyed this review of the Charlotte's Web liquid-filled hip extract capsules I really do like taking them and I'm curious to know if you guys have seen any of these in your local CBD retailers yet I just got them and so I'm curious to see if you've tried them and if you like them better or if you liked the extra strength capsules from last year better I have still seen I'm still seeing more of the extra strength capsules in in my local retailers but I am really excited to hear what you guys think if you like the liquid feel better than the powdered filled or have you ever had anything spill so I'm let me know by leaving me some comments down below I'm really curious to see what your thoughts are again my name is Jennifer Dixon with green valley nation and I can't wait to see you again soon take care bye bye [Music]", "8Yq86bip74U": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today I'm going to talk to you about the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb is the purse friendly portable topical CBD supplement that you can bring with you anywhere that comes in two sizes a half an ounce 150 milligram cats eyes and a ounce and a half 450 milligrams size Charlotte's Web recommends that these products be used to help to enhance your overall quality of life and wellness I love to use them to help me recover from exercise and normal aches and pains but before we go any further make sure you like and subscribe to this channel Charlotte's Web is a US company based out of Colorado and I like to think of them as kind of like the mama to CBD companies because they have been growing and manufacturing CBD supplements since 2011 they do have facilities that are C GMP certified which is basically telling you it's like the same thing as a pharmaceutical grade compounding facility and they are US hemp authorities certified they do use organic farming principles but they are not certified organic and this product is non-gmo and vegan friendly and also contains no preservatives and only uses natural products like essential oils and botanicals to help bring about a nice pleasantly scented topical ointment that contains a fair amount of CBD so now let's talk about what you get when you purchase the Charlotte's Web him infuse CBD bomb there is 300 milligrams of CBD per ounce in the bone and currently there are two sizes that you can get this half an ounce which I actually really prefer to carry fits easily inside the palm of your hand you can slide it into your back pocket or throw it into your purse and they also have the 450 milligrams which is a little bit bigger it still fits in your palm but it's a little bit harder to fit in to the back pocket it does come in a metal container and it is originally wrapped with cellophane you will find that it's a very durable product and it's not super easy to come off so that's why I love to have it like for the pocket and the purse but could do keep that in mind if you tend to have stiff fingers or you maybe have trouble with that dexterity I love it because my kids struggle to open it up just a little bit but for like my father-in-law he kind of struggles sometimes to get this off just a bit the hemp infused balm is lightly scented with essential oils I basically really only sell smell clove and maybe a little bit of a mint flavor it is very lightly scented and they only use essential oils but because it is scented I wanted to let you know in case you do have sensitivities to things like smells they do use a natural emulsifier like shea butter and sunflower oil as the carrier and it is in two different sizes this half an ounce in the 1.5 ounce currently you can get these products in Canada US Brazil and in select retailers over in the UK based on what their inventory levels are and they do have test results available but from this QR code located on the back of both containers now if you have watched a few of my reviews you may have noticed that I have had quite a bit of a beef with the Charlotte's Web how do I say this CoA or their disclosure of their analysis they don't necessarily make it the easiest thing in the world for you to find the test results you can you scan this QR code and then you have to find the batch number and that for these containers is actually stamped on the side so this is D 28 and this one is L 0 1 so once you scan the QR code you actually have to type that number into the search function and then you'll get to the COA results but here's where I'm eating a little bit of crow from the time that I did the review on the capsules and now the two different cos are completely different now the Charlotte's Web cos contain the full cannabinoid profile so these show that you have both CBD CBD a CB G and CBC unfortunately it did not test for CB n but you will also find that the test results showed that it passed for there are no traces or load limited to non detectable amounts of pesticides and microbials which means basically that these guys although they are not certified organic they're not using pesticides and I love that because I don't want to put anything else that could damage or injure me long-term and I love knowing that that I can find that with the co ace now let's talk about what it's like when you actually use the Charlotte's Web him infuse bomb so you have to kind of screw it off which we've talked about and you'll notice that it's a slightly yellow the kind of waxy look I kind of compare it to like my my husband's chapstick if you will as you rub your finger on it you'll notice that it starts to melt on your hands and you'll also notice that it kind of goes on a little bit almost like wet or waxy feeling that thickness does stay on top of the skin for a few minutes but I feel like it helps to give your skin the ability to have extra time to absorb it but keep in mind if you're putting this on you might want to wait a little bit before putting your clothes on it because I wouldn't want you to have like an oil residue stain on it it does have a very light scent which I absolutely love and you will find that you start to notice the benefits of the supplement within about a half an hour I would say 20 minutes to a half an hour is when I start to notice that the absence of the severity of any residual pain that I have so let's talk about the top three reasons why you should use the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse balm first of all I think it smells pretty lovely second of all it goes on very easily you can basically put it on anywhere that ails yeah I'm putting it on my net because I'm a little bit stiff today and within about a half an hour I'm gonna start to notice that the muscles on my neck are gonna start to relax and it's it feels like the inflammation is going down because of the CBD and other natural substances that they add into the product I also love the fact that this stuff comes in fairly affordably in terms of a topical CBD product this is a really great way to test out a CBD product especially if you're new because it's a very convenient size and it is very very affordable the things that you might want to keep in mind when you are purchasing a topical supplement is that although this is a very durable container it can be somewhat difficult if you have stiff hands or stiff fingers or a loss of dexterity of any sort it can be a little bit tricky the other thing to keep in mind is although I find the scent very pleasant if you are sensitive to essential oils or since in general this does have a smell to it so if you get triggered like with headaches or whatever definitely keep that in mind as well when you're looking for this looking at this supplement so let me summarize everything we've talked about and one little little present with a bow on it the value that you get with the Charlotte's Web hemp infused balm is a fairly concentrated topical product that contains no preservatives it is organic it is non-gmo and vegan friendly the Charlotte's Web company does certify cGMP and they are US hip Authority certified so you know you're getting a very good quality product it is lightly scented with essential oils and this one container the smaller 150 size does last quite a while this stuff has a little bit goes a long way but keep in mind it can be somewhat difficult to open if you have a little bit of loss of dexterity or stiffness and fingers and because it does contain essential oils there the the cent factor so if you're sensitive to that keep that in mind as well it does come in very affordably priced especially for this lower concentrated the 150 size the half and outside so it's very affordable but it could be somewhat difficult to open up I absolutely love it and I think you will too have you tried it let me know leave some comments down below and let me know if you've tried the hemp infused balm or if you've tried another Charlotte's Web product I would love to know what your results were like my name is Jennifer Dixon again I'm with green valley nation and make sure you like and subscribe to this channel so you can stay up to

using cbd at an impressively increasing rate and popularity doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon in this brief video rundown we tell you what cbd is where it comes from and how you can use it to achieve a number of practical health benefits the word cbd is actually short for cannabidiol which is a naturally occurring phytochemical compound found in most strains of cannabis and hemp before we go any further this is actually a good time to go ahead and explain what the difference is between hemp and cannabis or marijuana hemp and marijuana are actually the same species of plant cannabis sativa l while marijuana strains typically have a thc content between 10 and 20 percent hemp by definition contains just 0.3 or less thc of course is the psychoactive chemical in cannabis and is the compound responsible for the high that cannabis produces cbd on the other hand can be found in high amounts in both hemp and marijuana and unlike thc cbd has no mind-altering properties meaning it does not produce any kind of a high so to answer the question of what is cbd it's simply a compound specifically a compound called a cannabinoid that's produced naturally in cannabis let me take a quick second to remind you to subscribe to the way of leaf channel and turn on notifications if you haven't already every subscriber counts and is crucial to our growth and we appreciate every single one of you it goes a long way to help us achieve our goal of getting the best possible cannabis content out there and to the most amount of individuals also don't forget to check out our website wayofleaf.com anyway getting back to the topic as far as how cbd works within the body this has to do with various interactions within the endocannabinoid system or ecs the ecs in humans is a complex network of neurotransmitters and receptors that helps regulate and maintain a variety of physiological processes when we consume cbd the compound interacts with the ecs receptors to help return cells and their various tissue and organ systems back to a state of balance and homeostasis the most interesting part is that ecs receptors exist in nearly every single cell and tissue type in the human body this explains why for one person cbd might help with something like nerve pain in the feet while for someone else it might help with migraines or help muscles to recover after an intense workout there have been hundreds of studies carried out on the medical potential of cbd as of right now we know that cbd possesses anxiety reducing pain relieving and even neuroprotective activity cbd is also the active ingredient in the prescription drug epidialex which is used to treat rare forms of pediatric epilepsy in terms of safety and practicality of use it appears that cbd is less dangerous and has fewer side effects than the majority of prescription medications on the market in fact the world health organization describes cbd as generally well tolerated with a good safety profile the organization also mentions that cbd presents no public health related problems what else can we discuss to help answer the question of what is cbd oil as far as legality cbd is widely available in most u.s states due to unique legislation in the u.s farm bill while the farm bill doesn't mention anything specifically about the legalization of cbd it does mention the legalization of hemp which cbd is found abundantly in that being said the hemp derived cbd market is still not tightly regulated in order to find a good high quality cbd product that will actually work we recommend doing plenty of research reading plenty of reviews and making sure you only buy a product that comes with a third-party lab report among other things third-party lab reports ensure that the milligram amount of cbd that says the bottle has is actually the amount that's in the bottle for a rundown on some of the best and most effective hemp derived cbd products currently available be sure to check out our cbd section over on our way of leaf website we review hundreds of cbd products in an effort to point out what's good and what's bad about some of the biggest cbd names out there on the market we hope this video has helped to answer the question of what is cbd oil of course if you have anything to add or if you have any additional questions feel free to leave a comment below and don't forget to like

it's the time we've all been waiting for shower time don't come for me for my outdated shower i'm still renovating my house thank you okay the main thing that i wanted to exfoliate was my stretch marks because they are my biggest insecurities so i went ahead and took that cbd scrub and scrubbed away i noticed that if you added water to the scrub it kind of emulsified it i started off trying it with dry skin and then i tried it with wet skin emulsified better with wet skin obviously i always pat to dry that's what my mama taught me so i teach you quick comparison so i already own this one but this one i noticed leaves my skin a lot softer kind of reminds me of this if you like this you'll love this and then i got out of the shower and headed to better lighting and tried the oil i put it on my chest my shoulders and my booty i have like a really dry chest so i wanted to try it out you can see it glisten and it really really worked calmed me down i was loving it i noticed while using it it quickly absorbed which was awesome and my skin lightly glistened and then when i used it on my booty it almost seemed like it instantly firmed my stretch marks which is pretty awesome so you have to dance to that then when applying the lotion it also quickly absorbed i think the two combo of the oil and the lotion is so dance worthy don't judge the appearance i was working all day took my makeup off and tried the face oil kind of hard to give a first reaction face care product i think i mean hey we'll see what happens right this is just like a vlog part of it so i just tried the oil and the lotion like for the first time and i was taking clips the application i was really really stressed out earlier this morning about all the things that i had to do today when using the

about CBD let's check it out [Music] what's up guys it's your boy big Jay coming back at you from vet Co TV where you watch decide and fate and today I've got some CBD FX products what is CBD FX it is CBD oil alright for those of you that want to try something not over-the-counter you know where the doctor is if you're like being you don't like doctors feeding me pills and all that other crap and you just want to try some something that you know will probably help you that's just my personal opinion and I have to say it's only my personal opinion though you know might actually help you out you need to check this stuff out now today I've got the 60 and the 120 all right the reason I'm putting these two together in a group is these are like your beginner kit if you will alright these are the ones you want to try if you don't have anything you know to major going on or you just you know what try it for the first time see what it might do for you alright these are like low to mid-level CBD doses if you will they're not you know you'll see in another video I have two that are a little more potent these are the day to day aches and pains you know that this is the get you buy stuff alright I don't know how else to really put it without getting you know too into it so with that said let's go ahead and check out the box I'm gonna pick the 60 because basically the boxes are the same except they're just different colors so let's check out the box shall we alright guys so here the box hashtag feel the difference CBD FX 60 milligrams 10 ml bottle made in the USA and produce in the FDA registered facility two pharmaceutical standards that's very important flip it over on the side again so important that they put on their produce in an FDA registered facility to pharmaceutical standards the reason that's important guys if you're putting this in your body you want to make sure it's the best you can possibly get all right if it's not made in a pharmaceutical facility or pharmaceutical grade facility you don't want it all right flip it over on the back ingredients there is a proprietary blend of cannabidiol propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin so basically it's just like your babe juice all right with a proprietary blend of CBD okay that's all it is these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited now what that whole statement means is the FDA they haven't studied it so therefore they say you can't say anything about it because the almighty FDA says that since we didn't study it you can't say it because you know unless we say it first then it can't be true that's all that means CBD and CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and is legally imported and produced we'll go over that I have a fact sheet for you CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products they're in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the u.s. CSA again on my fact sheet I'll cover it and then it just has some trademark stuff here at the bottom made in Lhasa a Los Angeles California flip it on the side shake before each use for best results this is true anytime you get CBD in a liquid form you always want to shake it just because some settling does occur and a little bit of separation occurs so you want to shake it all up get your best results some residue is natural suggested use for a tank okay if you want to use it in an actual vape tank one to two droppers pull for a dripper and then one half to one dropper spool for a regular tank rich in essential omega-3 fatty acids and amino acid hashtag feel the difference and we're back to the front now the only difference between the 60 and the 120 like I said is the color and as you can see the 60 milligram is green the 120 milligram is blue other than that it's all the same package so let's bust one of these out and give it a shot so we took her out of the box boom here's the bottle CBD FX 60 milligram 10 milliliter roll it around ingredients got your CBD propylene glycol vegetable glycerin made in Los Angeles roll the back around for best results you want to shake it it does contain some well shouldn't say contain there is some residue that is natural and it is made in the USA roll it back around to the front and there we go so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste test alright so when you have the bottle you can see there's a little bit of perforation here on the side if you can't really see it on the camera I'm sorry but you'll find it just grab it boom pulls all the plastic off bang throw that to the side now you might be able to see you like this little orange ish residue at the top that's what they're talking about okay that's why they're saying shake it all right you want to shake it until it's basically all one color well alright so everything in there is now all shaken up push down spin bang and there we go that's what its gonna look like right it's a somewhat milky you know I should say it's a little foggy but it's not perfectly clear it's not supposed to be but let's go ahead and try some okay now CBD in its home like raw form is gonna have a very earthy taste to it I don't really know how to explain it yeah earth is gonna have to be about the best way to describe it it's not a bad flavor by any means and you can kind of skip some of the flavor if you put it under your tongue I put it directly on my tongue and even this is the 60 this is the 120 the the flavor like the intensity of the flavor really doesn't increase as the milligrams go up it's just you know it just contains more CBD in it so if you can get by the flavor in the 60 you know the 120 the 300 to 500 it's all the same after that if the flavor is something that really you know is a big sticking point to you check out the gummy bears that they have which are amazing you can check out the hemp capsules that they have which have zero flavor at all but honestly you know another way to get around the flavor aspect of it too is like they said put it in a tank all right put a couple drops in the tank and then fill some of your favorite a liquid on top of it and you can still vape it that way okay you don't have to vape it straight if you don't want to and then you know at that point the flavor really isn't that much of an issue it's not really that much of an issue for me it's definitely a different flavor than anything you've ever had but it's nothing you can't you know it's nothing that you can't get past so now that we've tried it let's go over some facts so you might be wondering well I heard CBD is illegal okay well there's a couple reasons that this CBD made by CBD FX is not illegal alright one non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 that's number one there have biomass meaning the crop with wit you know from which their CBD is is made does come with an import certificate signed off on by Homeland Security they only use CBD derived from the stalks of European grown hemp plants okay that's very important it's European grown hemp plants their products also meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which basically means it has to contain less than 0.3 percent THC now for the big one that pretty much takes care of all your fears and worries our products are exempt from the CSA and de-age drug scheduling practices which classify whole hemp extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stalks of EU European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice so there you go alright real simple it's it's it's not illegal because it meets the certain criteria that basically say the CSA and the DA's ruling regulations don't work for that because it comes to the States legally okay we covered that part and the European grown industrial hemp doesn't fall under their their statues so Oh legal it works at least it works for me now on the box that said the FDA says it hasn't you know we can't verify these statements right but what I can say is personal experience I've probably gone over this story a couple times and a couple of different CBD FX videos I've done but I'm gonna you know give you another little one just in case you've never tried any of these products before what it does for me I was the guy that would go to bed and I couldn't split my brain off at night all right I was always thinking about something always doing something always flipping through my phone alright if you're one of those people you've got to try this also I have a day job I am NOT YouTube famous I don't make millions of dollars at this I just make these videos to help you guys out alright so that being said I have a day job working a factory I climb ladders I'm walking across hard concrete floors all day played sports when I was younger go to the gym now you know you get aches and pains alright it comes with age it comes with everything you know it comes with where you might go home your feet hurt your ankles hurt your knees hurt stuff hurts okay once you join the real world and the workforce and all that stuff and you start doing real world stuff stuff starts to hurt alright if you want to take the edge off boom all right try CVD okay that's that's what works for me I'm not a guy that likes to go the doctor I don't like having Big Pharma's pills pushed down my throat you know I'm not into any of that crap because in my opinion some of that stuff is way worse for you than it is good so I like to stick to natural stuff natural okay all natural and it works alright I'm allowed to say that because it works for me now do yourself a favor don't just take this try some and then go well it didn't work

one pill is not working and chances are if you call him back and say hey one pill is not working what's he gonna say try to alright mess around with this a little bit try some okay try the suggested dose if that doesn't work bump it up a little bit or bump up your milligrams instead of using 60 try 120 you know if those don't work I have two other products a 300 and a 500 milligram all right

heal by using a treatment found in a form of marijuana she's using hemp oil to treat her illness new at five ten News reporter Steve Fiorina joins us with how the girl is doing now with a combination of traditional and alternative treatments Steve Steve this is Dalia she's better than she's been in months her mother thanks doctors and nurses for saving her little girl's life with conventional surgery and with chemotherapy but she drew the line at radiation and that's where the hemp oil comes into play now your Barnhardt is a little go-getter an active three-year-old is battling brain cancer and poster child for an herbal supplement CBD her mom is sold on her quality of life was deeply diminished and the CBD seems to me to almost overnight have given that back to her Dalia had gone through months of treatment and was still suffering issues with pain and brain damage really from the surgeries and the chemo both there's a growing trend made popular by a CNN special called weed examining alternative treatments we needed to try something else and at that point in time marijuana was that natural course of action to try cancer epilepsy and other debilitating diseases the child who had had 300 seizures a week was now down to just one every seven days mariah Barnard tried CBD and was immediately impressed the very first night she ever took it she slept through the night for the first time in her entire life along the lines of medical marijuana but without the high so there's not the stigma no legal issues it has the same compound CBD in it but it does not have the psychoactive effects of THC which is found in medical marijuana hey there it's Matthew with him meds px' how are you CBD is produced here in San Diego at hemp meds px big business already after just two years 2000 customers last year here's the lab where the hemp is distilled of various forms of the compound a half milliliter daily dose is taken orally he generally put it under your tongue and let it absorb keep in mind this is a supplement not traditional medicine it's definitely not a prescription drug what it is it's a simple compound that's found from a simple plant much like vitamin C is found from oranges CBD is found from commercial hip we also sought outside opinion and received this from the American Cancer Society no comment about this specific product or any product that have not undergone rigorous scientific testing would you caution all patients and caregivers consult with their physician before using any dietary supplement or alternative therapy that meds is seeking FDA approval Steve Fiorina attended", "pHrRIBQaKjg": "hi Lindsay here remedies registered nurse so how do you take CBD oil the most effective way to take CBD oil is to either apply it under your tongue in the tincture or the oil form or to take a capsule form when you put CBD oil under your tongue you want to let it sit there for a good 60 seconds so that it's fully absorbed and what will happen is there's a rich system of blood vessels under your tongue lots of blood supply there so by putting it under your tongue you're allowing the CBD oil to go directly into your bloodstream in this sense you will get the most product and you will also get a quicker more effective benefit of the plant you can also take it in a capsule form which is a great alternative the main difference between the capsule form and the sublingual oil is that when you take it in a capsule it goes through your liver first so you do get one filtering of the product through your liver first before it enters your full bloodstream so you are getting a little bit less of the full benefit by taking it in capsule however it's really not a bad alternative if you can't take the sublingual oil for whatever reason you can also apply CBD oil and various forms to your body so if you have an aching joint or headache popular ways to apply it would be a salve or a gel or even a roll-on so these are all great options to to get CBD in or on your body to help that homeostasis or that balance you can also vape CBD oil as well you also want to be very careful with the products you're using because there are so many of them on the market out there these days and if you'd like more information on that or about any of these things or if you'd like a 15 minute complimentary CBD consultation for yourself then please

feet of social distancing keeping an eye out for others but what are we out here in this balls out hot weather for we're out here for weed today today on wheats we are going to be reviewing mary's medicinals tinctures another tincture today reviewing a lot of tinctures because i got a lot of love for the tincture uh this is i think our first time reviewing mary's medicinals uh this is their one to one formulation one to one meaning one one cbd to thc so for every milligram of thc there is another milligram of cbd in there as well uh this is 300 and 300 got some lab testing results there and confusingly this is mary's medicinals the remedies by colton whoever the hell colton is congratulations to you colton um you've made you hit the big time you got your name with your signature on a bottle of wheat tincture good for you colton excited to try your stuff um so as i said 600 milligrams in total 300 thc 300 cbd although actually i feel a little bit ripped off on the side with the lab testing results probably not going to focus but even if it doesn't i'll tell you uh it's actually a little bit less for each about 280 for each with the lab testing results so not quite as potent as they had advertised um and this is a bit more expensive of a tincture at uh 53 bucks for the 600 milligrams total of cannabinoids which is a little bit more expensive than the ones we've been reviewing recently which come in usually about 55 60 bucks for a thousand rounds but you got to pay for that colton signature um and i picked this up as i said 53 bucks at a dispensary in long beach uh california um and let's just go ahead and get it started uh this is again another cbd thc blend which i have talked about before my opinion of i have kind of a mixed feeling of cbd thc blends um not always for me but today felt like the right time for a high that is potent and strong but not as um anxiety inducing as some of the others the cbd helps sort of want some of the more psychoactive effects of the thc um which is usually what i go for but today i felt you know it's a hot day let's just relax so let's go for the very very sedating effects of the thc cbd blend um and like all of our wheat's reviews we do about a hundred milligrams of thc per review uh this is 300 in here so we're gonna have to do about a third of this thing in totality uh to get our review in let's go ahead and shake it it's a very very very small tincture coming in at only 12 and a half grams weighed by weight and not by volume curious for a tincture i'm going to set this aside for now and so here is our tincture well shaken um it doesn't really have any uh dosing instructions on it it says they recommend 5 milligrams which is ah about 0.25 milliliters well that's volume now weird so it is measured by volume here and they recommend uh they say five milligrams is 0.25 milliliters so again we're going to do 100 which means 20 of those doses uh which means what uh four five full droppers in totality i think i if i did my math right well that's 0.75 milligrams so that is 15 milligrams of thc according to their math we'll do it sublingually at home i'll go up [Music] and now we wait [Music] [Music] oh wow that is very bitter tasting way more bitter than it oh really regretting not bringing something to drink because that is amazing what is in this whoa oh i was not expecting that this is safflower oil uh is the base for this one and it is bitter as all hell wow okay well that was uh 30 milligrams of the total 100 i'm going to do so i have a triple and then some of this to do go ahead and do another one of those and then i've got let's do another 30 milligrams here that's 75 that's 15. and hurry so i have 40 more milligrams to go after us i'll do this off camera over the next hour or so and then two hours i brought rock brother i'll come right back here and let you guys know about mary's medicine i hope we could i coulda only about three hours or so [Music] goodbye well hello everybody i am back it has been uh two hours since my last dose of mary's medicinals the remedy one to one by colton there's good old colton hopefully you get it finally get to peep his signature up close now i know you guys have been waiting to see colton's signature little horse did a live stream in between thanks everybody tuning in um and so what do we think of mary's medicinals the remedy one to one well um it's uh it works it's a it is a competent good tincture um my 100 milligrams probably did slightly um less than 100 milligrams uh as i still aimed for 20 of the notch marks again they say one quarter milliliter a quarter milliliter is five milligrams um so i did 20 of those quarter milliliters um and the reason that isn't a hundred milligrams of thc like it should be um is because uh it's not actually as strong as advertised they uh they they say that it is 300 milligrams of cbd and thc but instead of doing the opposite thing that most people do which is giving you more and charging you the same amount they gave you less and charge the same amount as it only really has 277 milligrams of thc or about uh 4.6 drops of thc or 4.6 milligrams of thc per quarter milliliter which isn't a lot difference but it's almost 10 percent different than what they're saying on the bottle that's 300 milligrams says 300 milligrams everywhere right here right there um so you know that's a little weird and shady um that you get less than it's advertised but i just did want to let you know that uh i probably didn't get 100 milligrams here but it's still an effective tincture i'm i'm pleasantly high in that same cbd uh thc blend of high where you feel um more sedate uh less the sort of the less cerebral elements of the high and the more just kind of um pleasant serene uh body high and mellow feelings that i usually so associate with the combination of the two um so uh that was a lot of complaints there about the mislabeling and i do have a couple of more things that i do want to say that i don't find particularly nice about it uh the price well one this is a 600 as i said in the first half this is 600 milligram tincture um for 600 being 3 300 of both cbd and thc when you can find um just as good in my opinion uh tinctures that have a thousand milligrams of thc or cbd or 500 of both or some blend um for the same price that are just as good so uh you get less there as well that is a knock against it um and then uh to reiterate uh this is extremely bitter uh it is it is really truly disgusting tasting uh sort of shockingly so i actually wasn't expecting it i've had a lot of tinctures uh and most the time i'm surprised by how mellow they are my guess is it's maybe the safflow the safflower oil i don't see that as a very common i don't know if i've ever seen it base for the tincture um maybe that's what makes it so bitter i don't know but it is extraordinarily bitter uh this tincture so just watch out for that you know i did a lot of it at once but i can tell you with a lot of a surety even a little bit of this is going to taste very very very bitter ugh so it also tastes in my opinion way worse than most tinctures so it's more expensive uh or it you get less for your money and it's even less than advertised and it's incredibly bitter but it does work quite effectively so it's not a total and it's not that much more expensive i'm not [ __ ] on this in any way shape or form uh it's just not my favorite tincture um i'm gonna stick with uh in some other brands personally um again quite effective quite potent um but it is just not the value or the taste that i am looking for in a tincture so um you know you win some you lose some bit of a mixed bag this time well that's guys is then going to do it for this review here on wheats that's that's gonna be it for mary's medicinals confusingly the named the remedy one by one one two one by colton it's gonna do it for everything here on wheats today until we see you on our next review or video or live stream whatever it is stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you right back here goodbye", "VxeS3yc0jkQ": "[Music] friend that everybody was talking about CBD oil now it comes to the cannabis plant and many believe they can help with everything from anxiety and chronic pain to diabetes even cancer we're in the midst of a CBD oil boom with products popping up everywhere today dr. Sanjay Gupta is here to investigate what exactly is CBD oil and does it live up to the hype but first I asked correspondent Marsha have a compo if I'm at how big CBD has truly become CBD if you haven't heard of it yet you probably will soon the natural herb is taking the health world by storm with sales of the new supplement expected to grow 700 percent in the next two years Wow you just see great review after great review I mean people seem to love this stuff 4000 reviews four and a half stars short for cannabidiol CBD is a component of the cannabis plant yep cannabis but unlike marijuana CBD does not contain any THC the psychoactive part of the plan so it doesn't get you high over the last few years CBD has started popping up in everything from gummies to face cream to toothpaste there are even CBD treats for your pet so what does it do research has been limited but proponents say CBD has all the benefits of medical marijuana without the intoxicating effects helping with insomnia pain management and anxiety there's a revolution of whole movements happening now with plant-based wellness which is our primary interest celebrating the power of all plants which have not been properly represented and the question everyone asks is is it legal dr. Sanjay Gupta CNN medical correspondent the cheap one and if you pour it on the latest research beyond CBB so you know what Vegas time for everybody I like take your thoughts on what it really is so people can get this into their heads what you think about the cannabis plant marijuana it's called cannabis it really has lots of different ingredients but two primary ones one is THC that's the stuff that's the recreational drug it's what gets people high gives them that euphoria and their CBD which is cannabidiol it's it's something that doesn't cause a psychoactive component it's believed to be a medicine it's been used as a medicine in decades past and it's getting this resurgence as you just heard so just to be clear we've talked about medical marijuana in the past this is not that right CBD oil is being sold all over the place you take the plant and you can pull out certain components of it so you're just put in this case you're pulling out the CBD component and you're just using that and and therefore you're not getting all those other effects that people often associate with marijuana which is why I think 47 states so far have said it's right we're okay with it how was the medical community using CBD is this is fascinating to me I mean if you would ask this question five years ago it would have basically been crickets nobody was really talking about it within the last five years you had a medication that was a sort of known colloquially as Charlotte's Web it was for the little girl who had seizures that just could not be treated by all these different medicines she took her mom essentially started taking CBD herself in her kitchen sink and giving it to her daughter that was what was known as Charlotte's Web within five years it's gone from being that idea to now an fda-approved drug in this country that that's fast that's never really happened that government has approved a ver a one CBD oil for one indication yes and this is from the plant this isn't synthesized in some lab this is CBD that's actually coming from the plant from the botanical so that that's a big deal you actually now have something that's been considered illegal at the federal level also part of an fda-approved drug that's that's that's what we're dealing with in this country wrap your heads around this it's this is part of this connect right the federal government says it's not legal 47 states say it is a kids with seizures are being treated let me FDA says yes we'll approve it but but still at the federal level it's illegal what is starting to gain more traction I think really is what's happening with opioids in this country what they found dr. Oz was that in several states that had approved CBD legislation they saw their opioid prescriptions start to go down so that's that's an area the medical community is really really focused on is a neurosurgeon you're good at this stuff explain to me how CBD actually affects the body well we have all these different receptors in our bodies to basically attracting to have these these components activates but because those receptors are everywhere in the body you could get an impact just about anywhere it shows to everybody because I've made a little model to demonstrate what Sanjay is saying CBD produces so many effects throughout the body based the fact it can bind to receptors in so many of our different organs right places as far away as the intestinal tract in your and your spinal column up up into your brain and that's why people say it helps them alleviate pain right maybe help with seizures it's a pretty serious problem for a lot of folks anxiety pretty common problem that we don't want to treat if we don't have to even withdrawal for medications maybe the even the opiates Angie mentioned but think about that people think you could do some way things because of the CBD oil that is in there is touching so many parts of our body and I love your thought that we evolved in a species because we had access to these natural plants and they understandably can affect this that's right and we in the receptor started to evolve in our body as well we even started making our own form of CBD in our body but sometimes it's not enough just like other things aren't enough in our body and that's why some people seem to get benefit so the question then becomes do they work their practice CBD oil which again you saw the theoretical arguments just made but these products are popping up everywhere and some of these are everyday items that you can buy I haven't bunch in front of them again we don't sound you're not gonna sell anything in this space but their samples or supplements they're gummies they're muscles through the in creams they're even pricing your pets as you saw from Mars report so when you look at this Sanjay and you realize as a clinician how complicated CBD could be how do you decide which of these might work well you know you know it's interesting I'll tell you this I think in part from a physician's perspective first of all I think that there's a medicine in here I think we're talking about something that could actually really help people and I worry a little bit when you start to see products like this that they could minimize the importance of CBD could do for people because I don't know what these products are I don't know what's in them I don't know how much of anything is in them I don't know if they would actually do anything I mean this is CBD shampoo if I could get shampoo like dr. oz if I use it but you know I was not I covet your hair I'm not sure though I would have a hard time if somebody came to me and said hey should I take the CBD product as much reporting as I've done on it I would still have a hard time you know saying that's a good idea FDA is in charge in fact is charged by our nation to tell us they answered that question what's safe what's not where are they with all these things so this is an illegal substance at the national level this is illegal illegal at the same time as we talked about earlier the FDA has said you know what we think there's enough of a benefit here that we're willing to approve a drug specifically for epilepsy that's based on CBD and part what reason I wanted to cover this topic is you can buy these products anywhere really you can go down you know store and yeah 47 out of 50 states buy it online pretty much anywhere you want and the government's not gonna come and kick the door down so whatever they say in the you know that's right at the highest levels we're still not actually doing anything to stop them from using these which is a concern to me because it's the wild wild west it's completely unregulated that's right so if it does have all the potential that we're talking about today I want to understand what could be in your best interest CBD oil so up next we're gonna continue our investigation how much CBD is actually in these products and can it really work for you we have the test results and they might surprise you he convinced his followers that he was a prophet all nude survived the a sex cult pedophilia and incest they were encouraged I really truly believe I was going to be a martyr for God [Music] I'm back with dr. Sanjay Gupta investigating the CBD oil boom it's now a 1 billion with a B billion dollar industry and CBD sales are expected to grow 700 percent in the next two years I mean that's shocking proponents say CBD can be used to treat everything from anxiety chronic pain to epileptic seizures even cancer products like these ones in front of us here they're widely available stores and online but I get what you're paying for so where's research you know I hear tons not so much but whenever I said ok call by something I don't know what's the actual data that shows it at work and you can't find that much it's very hard to find the data I think on epilepsy seizures particularly ones that have not been treated by existing medications there's pretty good data that's why the FDA approved the drug but just about any of those other things you mentioned the anxiety the sleep even pain the CBD only research is pretty limited let me say though part of that doesn't you shouldn't immediately say well it doesn't work because of that part of it is that the research is hard to do if you have a substance that is illegal at the federal level how do you get research done on it it's very hard to get people to actually invest in that research that's part of the problem here and rarely have I been called by as many people saying it's helpful yeah these are folks you don't have a vested interest so it makes me really curious and as a physician I feel frustrated that we haven't done more right help them out that's it yeah absolutely no I mean we need we need to get that research done absolutely so let me introduce you to dr. Todd Cooper maze founder of the sewer lab comm they do all the work so that you don't have to and infested the most popular CBD products on the market well first of all you have a lot of things you could be testing why'd you decide to look at CBD oil as you were saying CBD has become super popular so the readers of ConsumerLab have been asking us really what's in these products because you know as you mentioned since it's illegal if a product actually says CBD and the amount on it the FDA will go after them and calling it an unapproved drug all right let's break it down we have all the data here I'm fascinated to see what you got first we wanted to actually figure out how much CBD is in the CBD oil product right so how how much assistance he was there right so we found over 10 fold difference between products and fold yeah as little as 2 milligrams to up to 22 milligrams in a suggested service so some of them had this much someone who had that much right but it's stunning to me are you surprised by this I'm I'm pretty surprised I think the the idea that you have no idea what you're getting if you're getting it at all I mean that's that's not even a real probable dose if you need hundreds of milligrams for to do anything two milligrams I could gonna do anything and yet people are paying a lot of money for it what about the cost yeah so on the cost we found that the price for a 10 milligram dose ranged them as little as 80 cents to up to 400 not four hundred four dollars and fifty cents for the same amount of CBD so again you know you can if you ship you know what to look for you can get it for a lot less than than the 450 I gave it ten times difference in price for this a is a different CBD you know it's really this it's a amount of CBD it's is same and it's ten milligrams of CBD NH product some can have a little bit of CBD a which is kind of a precursor but that's really fair amount of same amount of CBD and what about this issue of toxins contaminants heavy metals right well good news none of the nine products that we tested and these are products for people and animals taken orally as pills or liquids none of them had any heavy metal contamination none of them had any any significant amount of THC so when you look at all these products do you find that they're adequately labeled no not no I mean very few products are actually labeled appropriately in terms of the amount of CBD most you won't know and when you look at the labels they often won't say the amount of CBD so they'll use other terms like hemp extract that typically means they are extracting some some CBD from from the plant you're getting some if it says just hemp oil you're getting none hemp oil has no CBD in it they will often put it in hemp oil so you'll have hemp extract with hemp oil oh my god it's kind of confusing folks if you don't understand something these days is because they don't want you to understand it it's not an accident which is a problem because I really deep my heart agree with Sanjay that there's a medicinal benefit this US been around since the dawn of humanity and I don't appreciate the fact that we can't even figure out the basic rules that give you advice with okay give me your bottom line here CBG was what would you do right now you if you had a problem that one of the ones we listed I think that other than the things that have actually been tested you you really probably better off saving your money I think ultimately we're gonna we're gonna get more information about this it's gonna have to happen there's too much sort of anecdotal evidence of how this might work right now you're not even sure if you're getting CBD how much you're getting of it in these cases the products were safe but sometimes they may be contaminated heavy metals people say regulations a bad thing I think when it comes to this it's probably a good thing because if there's regulation it's gonna force these these these people who are making these products to list it to it's a stand by it and to make sure that they're safe and rewards the good guys people were making high quality products will benefit I think from have enough scoundrels pushed out Tim I thought they could work I'm hearing from too many of you right now that they're getting benefits but their problem with how we access is what you ought to do talk to your doctor about it get them to sit down for a second help them think can they'll help you they understand this stuff it they'll figure out which of these CBD oils might make sense from you there are some reputable companies I suspect that are beginning to get into the medical community but we've got to make this happen it's not going to happen from someone else doing it for you you got to step up in your own life and do the investigation for more information on CBD products we'll do our best you go to our website and guess what for the next 24 hours you can get the consumer labs complete report for free there so check it out spread it with your friends stay with us [Applause]", "Xnip3Mbt474": "[Applause] hello world my name is Justin Sims and I'm back for another CBD company review again guys just to catch you up my last video I did our first CBD review and I'm gonna do our second one today so basically guys I took like the the most popular CBD companies in the world and I dug in and try to do some research to give you guys a little bit more insight about what these top companies are like so today's company is called hemp wool bombs hemp bombs so hemp like the plant and then like bombs that she'd drop in a war so hemp bombs one word is the is the company that I'm gonna be reviewing today so guys some of the things that hemp bombs offers is they got CBD gummies they've got a liquids they've got oils they've got capsules they've got pain creams they've got CBD syrups that's a new one I didn't see a lot of companies that had CBD syrups this one does they have shots babe juices and a lot more they have heavy regulations which is a really really good sign that means that they're they're heavily regulated they're do a lot of third tab a third lab testing so that we're not just taking their word that their products good they actually have all these outside independent people reviewing their products that are all saying their products pretty good so um and also when you have a product that's heavily regulated that cuts down greatly on the product being contaminated this is a huge problem across the board with a kratom is that it's largely unregulated so you could have a really really good company with like their own lab and really got their their stuff together right next to a product that was made in a garage with a couple of guys that are picking their nose and then touching the product so because of so much contamination the two biggest things that the industry is seeing is that high levels of heavy metals have been found in some in some products and then also there's been a large number of Salmonella as well so when you see that a product's got heavy regulations that really cuts down on the risk of contamination so that's a good thing that hemp balms is doing so you guys are doing a good job hemp bombs they are third party tested as I mentioned so we're not just taking their word for it here's a red flag I found and I found it in the last product that I reviewed I didn't see anything about a water cellular bull forms now guys one thing that I didn't know really was that you know if I offer a prize that says soft gels that doesn't mean it's water-soluble so again guys just like I mentioned in the last video there's so much healthy great advantages of taking CBD but if it's not water soluble your body is naturally gonna break down anywhere between seventy to ninety percent of it so what's the point when you're gonna take something I only get 10 to 30% of its greatness I want all of it so I'm going towards products that have that water soluble so other than that guys hemp bombs across-the-board did pretty good I did reviews of the top-notch CBD companies and they are really good well the ones in the links below guys have the same qualities as those do really high quality CBD third-party lab tested etc but what separates these links below from the others is that there's a water soluble form so finally we're gonna get all of CV these wonderful element treating elements without losing all of it when our body naturally breaks it down so check these products out guys later on I'll do a couple of reviews about these guys a little more in depth but I want to hear what you think so check the link below click try the product let me know what you think I'll see you in the next video", "-7Jd5fiD4CA": "Green compass

in the description below as always if you like this video please consider subscribing to our YouTube channel and don't forget to hit that notifications icon to get alerted when we post a new video we greatly appreciate your support and now onto the topic at hand [Music] cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring non psychoactive compound found in the cannabis sativa plant findings on its potential health benefits led to research on using CBD for arthritis and fibromyalgia these are two common chronic pain conditions that affect millions of Americans more specifically researchers found evidence that oil extracted from the cannabidiol found in the hemp part of the plant may relieve pain and inflammation this could be a major medical breakthrough considering the adverse side effects of medications traditionally used to treat pain this video refers to published reports with findings that support this claim and can be found in the links in the description below however individuals considering using cannabidiol for reducing pain inflammation associated with these two health conditions should speak with their doctor first about the best way to use it and possible side effects this is crucial since the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved cannabidiol for this purpose although it recently approved the CBD based drug called epidemics for treating seizures so how can cannabidiol reduce arthritis symptoms patience with this inflammatory joint condition usually experienced long term mild to severe pain stiffness and reduced mobility these disabling symptoms can interfere with their overall quality of life one research done on rats concluded that transdermal cannabidiol has long lasting therapeutic effects on the inflammation and pain without the psychoactive side effects although the results don't necessarily translate to humans patients are hyped about the possibilities they're all so excited over another research that suggests this particular hemp cannabinoid can prevent pain and nerve damage caused by osteoarthritis let's discuss some of the benefits of cannabidiol for fibromyalgia patients with this condition suffer from widespread pain about the body due to causes that are largely unknown other symptoms are chronic fatigue anxiety depression and insomnia although quality research and an affirmative conclusion on the effects of cannabidiol oil on patients with this condition are lacking there's evidence of the positive effects of cannabis and cannabinoids on pain furthermore studies already found that cannabidiol can be beneficial for improving anxiety depression insomnia pain inflammation and other chronic conditions so what about the THC in marijuana and hemp well CBD derived products such as the oil can provide the healing benefits needed without the high caused by marijuana and it's high THC products the reason for this is the cannabinoid extracted from hemp and used to make the oil typically contains less than 0.3 percent THC or tetrahydrocannabinol this amount is not considered concentrated enough to alter the patient's mental state or cause other adverse side effects linked to marijuana THC this is in essence the most significant distinction between hemp and marijuana let's discuss some of the possible side effects of cannabidiol cannabidiol works by interacting with the natural cannabinoid receptors in the body's endocannabinoid system and altering the brains perception of pain however it goes without saying that studies are still ongoing on its safety efficacy and possible side effects although many patients show tolerance for the non psychoactive compound it may still cause the following mild side effects and others symptoms like dry mouth dizziness diarrhea fatigue appetite changes and changes in weight additionally cannabidiol and THC may interact with other drugs nutritional supplements or herbal medicine these chemical substances may also increase the risk of liver toxicity now let's talk about some ways to use cannabidiol cannabidiol products can be used transdermally for example as a skin patch and topically as a cream gel lotion or bomb the oil may be taken orally as a capsule tincture or medicinal drop vaped using a vaping device or added to foods or drinks here's a suggestion for use published for persons interested in trying cannabidiol for arthritic pain use low doses of CBD only products for pain relief start with five to ten milligrams twice daily and gradually increase the dose to fifty to a hundred milligrams once daily if the formula doesn't work try a CBD based product with a low dose of THC start using it only at night then slowly increase the dosage if necessary know what strain and dose of cannabidiol work best before trying edibles as their side effects last longer than vaping due to the risk of addiction dependency and psychosis persons 25 years old or younger should take caution when using cannabidiol products that contain THC lastly some things you need to be aware of CBD derived products with a THC content of more than 0.3 percent is considered marijuana and is therefore illegal in the u.s. other than when prescribed under a medical marijuana program that is licensed to permit use there are also other federal regulations set out in the farm bill on the use of cannabidiol extracted from hemp with this in mind it is essential for individuals to first find out that the product can be used legally in their state so speak with your doctor before using CBD oil for pain and inflammation to ensure they use a product that contains the right amount of cannabidiol and/or THC thanks for watching we hope we were able to show you how CBD can be used to help those suffering from arthritis and fibromyalgia let us know if

"qpbjLbp-SV0": "people are lighting up all over the country they call it the Green Rush marijuana has moved out of the back alleys and into the open after cannabis crop y'all in some states it's legal to grow to sell to smoke and marijuana could be legalized in a city near you so easy to get and many think so harmless but when the smoke clears is marijuana bad for you or could pot actually be good for you marijuana is better than all those pills for you in terms of treating day I travel the world for answers what does marijuana do to you what does it do to your kids a special investigation week our journey begins here in this small town home nestled in the mountains with the family who has never allowed TV cameras in before and you're gonna soon learn why this is a pretty out here yeah they live in Colorado one of two states where it's legal to smoke pot medically and recreationally but here it's also taboo to residents like Paige Figi and her husband Matt I'm sure it was mentioned to us by someone hey you should try that they're not no way he thought that's French way down a million years no but in this area marijuana is far from fringe we're joins and do you want island sweet skunk medical dispensaries are everywhere all right well god people are smoking in private clubs and public festivals but none of this is for Matt he's a military man and marijuana would be a career ender I grew up in Wisconsin in a well loving family and I was educated day like oh that's a drug you don't do that and I never did but just decades ago marijuana was a legitimate medication also called cannabis prescribed by doctors and dispensed by pharmacies this is Harry J that all changed in 1930 relentless warfare against Henry Gaines linker the United States first drugs are for him public enemy number one you guessed it marijuana this guy saw how he could increase the budget of his department by having this mission going at the marijuana you know saying that there's this drug that the Mexican migrant workers are smoking and it's loco weed and it's gonna make them crazy and they're gonna rape your women he got the anti-marijuana message out through news reports and then came this purely in the face the film reefer madness portraying the users of marijuana as unproductive crazed people are still afraid of what pot can do to them in many ways to have defined our attitudes now for 70 years yeah marijuana then became illegal in 1937 by 1970 it was a schedule 1 controlled substance the government was saying it had no medicinal value and had a high potential for abuse all reasons why the Figge stayed away from marijuana until this and this might be hard for some of you to watch this is their daughter Charlotte having a seizure we just thought it was just one random febrile seizure nothing to really do no medications it's a fluke right a fluke made sense after all Charlotte nickname Charlie was born perfectly healthy a fraternal twin to sister chase Charlie always had big big smiles just happy kids beezy yeah easy very much so so it was around three months you said that when you first noticed that he had a seizure I was changing her diaper while putting a new diaper on from after the bath and her eyes just started flickering it led to the first of many trips to the ER they did the million-dollar workup MRI EEG spinal tap you know they did the whole workup and found nothing in sent us home no abnormal blood tests no abnormal scan and developing normally to you know talking and walking the same day as her twin nothing was behind yet by the time she was too though the seizures had become constant and started to take their toll on there once happy joyful little girl she started to really decline cognitively and she was slipping away and she just wasn't keeping up with her twin the figis finally found an answer it was awful news j'avais syndrome it is severe intractable epilepsy the seizure start during the first year of life and are unstoppable difficult to control and very damaging severe behavioral problems attention deficit hyperactivity the self injury you know banging her head on the floor and pulling your hair out and like a possessed child this isn't your perfect happy Charlotte it was a race against time many Dravet kids died young in early childhood Charlotte was almost three for the next two years the figis tried everything strange diets acupuncture and dozens of powerful drugs like valium ativan inna barbital but nothing seemed to help even worse some of the medications nearly killed her after window she stops breathing and after two doses her heart will stop did you have to do CPR than on her your CS I remember when her heart stomped and I had her pulse and I lost her pulse there was just nothing the ambulance is on its way she survived but now it was fall of two thousand eleven and Charlotte was five years old when things were at their worst she just sees all night and the kids are sleeping either in my room or next door they can hear her the seizure stream all night 50 times a night and chase would come in in the morning and just misses her twin and just hug her and like rubber head and sams I'm just so glad you survived through the night last night Matt had been deployed to Afghanistan and the only thing he could do to help was start scouring the internet and he stumbled onto this video of a child using marijuana so how's everything go Jeannie had four days without a seizure I'm like wow how is having successful specifically gervais this is interesting it's natural and while he couldn't ever imagine taking marijuana himself he was now in the stunning position of recommending it for Charlotte I was like we need to do this and I said I don't know dang iron and then Charlotte's condition got worse 300 seizures a week almost to every hour she was not talking or moving basically catatonic as a last resort doctors wanted to either prescribe a powerful veterinary drug used on epileptic dogs or put Charlotte and a medically induced coma so her brain and body could rest for Paige those were not good options but maybe just maybe marijuana now was but she was about to find out how hard that would be this isn't go to the pharmacy and kick up your medicine there is no photo call when we come back what will the figis do and what would you do if this were your daughter I had resigned myself I don't think she's gonna survive this we've seen her flatline in hospital we said goodbye you're listening to Matt and Paige Figi described their own daughter what would you do if this were your child Charlotte Figi had an extreme form of epilepsy her body was so frail that any seizure could kill her with no traditional treatment left to try in the clock ticking away her parents decided to try marijuana Charlotte was just five years old you need a card in order to be able to get the cannabis from a pharmacy doctors have prescribed it you need two doctors in Colorado to get the card for a juvenile or child it was hard we were the first young child and they said no everyone said no no no no certainly her age played a played a role in my hesitancy dr. Alan Shackleford is a harvard-trained physician he's also among a handful of doctors in Colorado who give prescriptions for medical marijuana from the moment Charlotte entered his office he knew she was in trouble while he was just examining her she had two seizures she'd failed everything there were no more options for her everything had been tried except cannabis here's how scientists think it might work marijuana is made up of two ingredients th see that's the psychoactive part that makes you high and CBD also called cannabidiol it's the CBD that scientists think modulates electrical and chemical activity to help quiet the excessive activity in the brain that causes seizures I've been telling my patients dr. Julie Holland is the editor of the pot book a complete guide to cannabis for a long time the work on cannabis and epilepsy was sort of inconclusive maybe it works maybe it doesn't they couldn't quite figure it out it's only when they really started separating THC from CBD that they saw you know definitively yes CBD seems to really stop seizures so the figis needed to find something that was rare a strain of marijuana that was low in THC of course they didn't want Charlotte getting stoned but also high in CBD to treat her seizures and that wouldn't be easy dispensaries and growers they make their money off strains that are high in THC I'm Joel I'm Josh no one knows that better than the Stanley Brothers their family business is popped and if you look at these clean-cut guys and what you see surprises you don't worry they've heard it all before when we round the corner they're like oh wait a second you know did you finish high school they all not only finished high school but also college and in some cases graduate school now they are some of colorado's biggest growers and dispensary owners they produce up to 600 pounds of medical marijuana a year and much of that marijuana is high in THC but here on their remote farm at this undisclosed location in the mountains it takes a lot of planets where we're allowed to grow sick per patient they have been growing something different something they call revolutionary it's a greenhouse one greenhouse wine yes welcome dude welcome to paradise behind closed doors and under tight security we enter what the Stanley's call the Garden of Eden there's nothing like this in the world this plan is 21% CBD and less than 1% THC it took years of crossbreeding plants to get to this point instead of breeding up the THC we've bred down the THC and bred up the CBD people said you're crazy you know who's gonna smoke that so why grow it then well the Stanley's also believed in CBDs potential to treat many diseases and they had seen it changed lives before but always have too strict I meet 19 year old Chazz more he uses many different strains of marijuana many of them high in CBD to treat his rare disorder of the diaphragms my AB he can't catch his breath it's called Maya clonise diaphragmatic flutter this fluttering here it's annoying and it becomes painful he went pretty quickly i'm eating yeah yeah after like 15-20 minutes this is what i can let start to really feel he's about to show me how the marijuana works he's been convulsing now for seven minutes how quickly do you expect this to work what's it like the first five mins and I'm done like what's up that's it it was actually less than a minute depending on the attack in the day like it'll work within the first couple hits hear how his voice is completely different that attack lasted eight minutes but some have lasted much longer and happen as often as 40 times a day and like Charlotte he had tried so many things before by 16 Chaz was taking these powerful addictive potentially deadly narcotics and muscle relaxants daily like valium and morphine will be safe to say that that marijuana what you have in your hand there is better than all those pills for you in terms of treating what yeah I am yeah I wouldn't I'm not zombified I've had 16 17 attacks today and I'm still sitting up talking to you my first attack on all these I'd be in the hospital I'm a firm believer that marijuana has actually saved my son's life Jazz's father sean has a quality of life now is a thousand times better than what it was when he was on the pharmaceuticals a quality of life that Paige Figi desperately wanted for her daughter Charlotte but she still had one hurdle to cross convincing dispensary owners like the Stanley's to sell marijuana to a five year old little girl when Charlotte's mother called my brother Joel the brothers had a meeting us and tell us about this patient she's five years old he said and we said no we can't do that why it was the fear of the unknown Charlotte was the youngest patient at the time wanting marijuana would it be too much for her or would it change her life forever we'll find that out later but first learn more about what marijuana does to your kid's brain and yours as well April twentieth Denver Colorado tens of thousands from around the country and the world lighting up legally happy cannabis copy all for some it's a lifestyle for others it's a lifeline but for all of them I wondered what was it doing to their brains so my patients call me pot doc your patients call you papa they never meet anybody who's interested in hearing about their marijuana use as i am dr. Stacy Gruber is serious about pot I want you to name the color and not to read it okay I met her in her labs in McLean Hospital near Boston she's using high-tech imaging to see what happens in the brain when you smoke when you first smoke that is you know you light up a joint a spliff a blunt receptors which are throughout the brain respond and these areas of the brain are responsible for things like pleasure memory learning sensation sense of time and space coordination movement appetite and other drives shall we say so it's sort of an all-over impact right so reward pleasure hunger um you have this this overall feeling of well-being they say that all sounds pretty good but it does sound pretty good and it's not just feeling good but there's this phenomenon reported by many smokers over the years especially famous artists the ability to be more creative when you feel that high there's sort of a release of dopamine and your brain sort of has the ability now to perceive things slightly differently from the way you might have if you hadn't been smoking pot what you really see is this reduction in hibbett or e function welcome doctors are pretty spectacular less inhibition that's something that painter a mirror says helps him be more creative a successful artist his canvases sell for up to 25 thousand dollars it's my favorite way to work marijuana yeah he's been painting for 14 years smoking for even longer he says it makes him feel more relaxed but most importantly for him he says it makes him less critical of his own work stop worrying so much about this and that and just sort of looking and being as present as possible a mere does caution that it's a delicate balance for him it would make me very apprehensive as maybe a little paranoid just too analytical you can get paranoid can have disorganized thinking you get disoriented it can be uncomfortably to panic attacks or anxiety attacks and people how do you know when you've done too much simple tasks become very frustrating like mixing paint and then just sort of get into this state of uh you know now and why that happens is exactly what Columbia University neuro scientist Carl Hart is investigating exhale research subjects in his lab smoke marijuana and then take a variety of cognitive tests the effects will be disruption in memory disruptions in inhibitory control they will become slower at cognitive functioning a wide range of things these effects are temporary but they're pretty pronounced and they are clear and it's slowly becoming clear to scientists what part of the brain is most affected it's the prefrontal cortex it's very important for planning thinking coordinating your behaviors there are tons of marijuana receptors in this region and we think that marijuana particularly in the novice can disrupt all of those behaviors an impairment that Hart cautions could be dangerous especially when driving you may prematurely hit your brakes you may prove and surely get the gas pedal a wide range of things you may make a turn without looking more carefully look at this experiment done by CNN affiliate que ir o in Washington State subjects smoke marijuana and then drove one was a daily medical marijuana smoker and another an infrequent weekend smoker relaxed and buzzed the more the novice user smoked the more trouble behind the wheel watch yourself watch yourself but interestingly the habitual smoker didn't have as much trouble ellenboro know and that's something I witnessed firsthand driving around with 19 year old Chazz more the day that I spent with him he had been smoking all day long do you feel impaired at all no i don't i feel normal turns out when you test people who have a lot of experience with cannabis you don't see many disruptions but if you test people who have a sort of a limited history with cannabis you can see some clear pronounced disruptions of course no one thinks that driving when using marijuana is a good idea but what scientists can't answer is if there is a safe legal limit and if people who use marijuana daily as a medicine should be able to drive how impaired are they what is more clear though is the effect of marijuana on the young brain what we see is a very big difference in people who begin to smoke prior to the age of 16 and those who smoke after age 16 what we call early versus later onset Gruber's brain scans show that the white matter those are the highways that help the brain communicate from one point to another are impaired and those who start smoking early maybe there's underlying white matter connectivity differences that that's that's your concern it sounds like that those highways those white matter highways are just more disrupted in people who start smoking early that's that's what we see perhaps not surprising given what we know about the young developing brain that's a very delicate time in brain development and that's not a good time to be taking any drugs preliminary research shows that early onset smokers are slower at tasks have lower IQs later in life higher risk of strokes and increased incidence of psychotic disorders and while these studies are not conclusive some scientists are still concerned because in two thousand twelve thirty five percent of high school seniors lit up and that could mean a generation of kids with damaged brains and many fears something else I never really told myself I need to help a generation of marijuana addicts when we come back the truth and the science behind what's being called a growing epidemic and later Charlotte's story the first and youngest child to try marijuana in Colorado this was the day chas more almost died pumped full of drugs like morphine dilaudid valium to quiet a non-stop 48-hour attack I thought I was gonna overdose and yeah it was pretty bad at his bedside his father Sean watched his son go from being catatonic to what he calls high as a kite how are you wanting yeah I've watched friends of mine died from taking the same drugs that he took you see Sean was a drug addict and he had struggled for decades to get cleaned it was scary it was really important for him not to take these drugs if he could avoid them if he could avoid him I know how addicted they are I've seen it it scared the hell out of me but sean is not scared of marijuana and neither is Chaz this right here I don't get sick off of it I can't overdose and Chaz is right about that while there are fatal accidental prescription medicine overdoses every 19 minutes in this country there are virtually no reports of fatal marijuana overdoses and it's perhaps one of the biggest reasons most people think pot is safe in fact a new study of children showed that by high school only one in five think marijuana is harmful that's a lowest number in more than two decades and it's something we heard over and over as we traveled around the country not really that harmful it has a lot of benefits not really too concerned about it I think it's safe if you're a safe person probiotics but the experts we spoke to said there is more to the story there are people who compulsively smoke who want to stop smoking but they can't stop smoking in fact nine percent of marijuana users will become dependent now that's not as high as other drugs like heroin twenty-three percent of users become addicted or seventeen percent with cocaine or fifteen percent with alcohol but it's still approximately one out of every eleven marijuana smokers there is no longer any scientific debate that marijuana is not just psychologically addictive but also physically addictive so give me an update how you doing dr. Christian thur stone runs one of Colorado's largest youth substance abuse treatment clinics the number of marijuana addicts he treats has tripled in the last three years alone literally I cried about it marijuana is number one on their list of priorities they have dropped out of life back in the day I wouldn't feel like my day has really started it by getting day hi Joel Barga started smoking when he was just 13 x 15 he was smoking more than a dozen times a day he stopped skateboarding he even dropped out of school I like getting high I need to get high because my brain is telling me adolescence starting about age 13 have a pretty mature brain reward center so they can experience rewards and pleasures the same way adults can but the problem with that is that their prefrontal

is entitled my reviews on the Fae farm hemp oil healing lotion and worming muscle rub two years ago I had the pleasure of reviewing the faith farm serenity CBD lotion and I loved it this year I'm back with two more reviews on their amazing products one is a hemp lotion and the other is a worming muscle rub but first let me talk about the conditions I live with one of the things I love about CBD products is their versatility I live with the multitude of conditions that would and do take several medications to treat for one I'm autistic not that CBD oil would treat or cure that but it has helped a great deal with other symptoms that go along with being on the spectrum and a largely neurotypical non-autistic world for example PTSD OCD and depression in addition I also struggle with chronic neck and shoulder pain due to a car accident I was involved in 15 years ago while the pain is not constant when it does flare up there's not much I can do but pop some painkillers put on the TENS machine and pray for it to pass as if that wasn't enough I also have some trouble with my digestion which is common in autistics and I also have sensitive skin that's prone to breakouts thank goodness for makeup so when I was offered another opportunity to try this company's products I was delighted first some information about each product the first one is the faye farms healing hemp CBD lotion this lotion is designed to provide relief for neuropathy nerve pain eczema psoriasis contact dermatitis and other autoimmune skin disorders it contains soothing calming and healing ingredients created by nature for example it contains chamomile which is a powerful skin soother an anti-inflammatory it also contains argan oil which has been shown to reduce the signs of aging in addition this lotion contains 200 milligrams of hemp oil extract which acts as a natural pain reliever a nausea reliever and an immune system regulator now let's talk about the Fae farm h OE worming muscle rub the muscle rub is designed to soothe muscle aches and pains with organic herbs rich phytonutrients both warming and cooling essential oils and fifty milligrams of hemp oil extract the muscle robe may also provide a relief for cluster and tension headaches as well as migraines avoid contact with ice in addition to the healing hemp oil extract this muscle rub contains cayenne pepper a powerful anti-inflammatory that has gained recognition in multiple medical journals it also contains arnica a homeopathic agent that provides soothing relief from muscle soreness and bruising now let's talk about my experience with the faye farm products first the healing hemp lotion got it right here the healing hemp lotion has a refreshing and earthy scent with more than a hint of peppermint it absorbs quickly it's not greasy and I've been using it as an everyday lotion after I get out of the shower I love the smell of this stuff while this lotion doesn't have the same effect as the serenity lotion I reviewed a few years ago this one gives me a very light sort of calm feeling I have to say that I didn't notice a large difference in my skin but that's because it's not full summer here yet I have a feeling that this will be very good to have around when I get heat rashes and sunburn I only have to spend about five minutes in the Sun to get a rash furthermore insects love me for some reason and my immune system over reacts to their bites and stings so I know I will be really glad to have this lotion around during the hottest months of the year now I want to talk about the warming muscle rub I enjoyed using this from the first time I tried it when I feel a muscle spasm coming on I use a generous amount of the rub massage it into my shoulder and neck and it seems to stop a flare in its tracks if I get to it in time I would say the most primary scent in this is eucalyptus which is very pleasant to me this particular essential oil is helpful since ice suffer from allergies and my chest tends to feel tight this time of year so when I use it for my neck and shoulder it helps relieve some of my allergic discomfort to bonus I have to say I don't feel any warming sensation on my skin but since I use much stronger rubs like tiger balm and icy hot this is probably why one of the things I absolutely love about this rub is not the rub itself but the tenant comes in it's so easy to open I can't tell you how many times I've tried to use my weak hands to pry open a tin that's vacuum sealed and wanted to throw it across the room in frustration this tin is a simple screw top so if you're already in pain and irritable what's supposed to help you won't make it worse I'm undecided about the lotion since I feel I need to use it more but I would definitely recommend the muscle robe where you can buy a farm hemp products at present PHA farm does not sell there h OE CBD line on their main website so if you're looking for those you can find them at the link that I will post below if you're looking for the same product without the hemp oil extract you can visit the Fae farms website and I will put a link to that below as well if you would like you can come and check out

the CBD quickly enters the bloodstream through your lungs completely skipping the digestive tract this is great for those who suffer from anxiety or pain that comes and goes it's also inconspicuous unlike smoking nicotine or cannabis CBD oil has a very discreet odor that will not alert people around you to its use the vaporizer itself is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse and come in place enough that no one is likely to question what substance that you're using CBD oil is also very pure the best vaping liquids come with a maximum of four ingredients seaweedy often an isolate form and ingredient are - to bind and thin the oil to make it big full and sometimes a flavoring component no extra chemicals additives or harmful substances just pure CBD the fourth and last reason is flexible dosage anxiety and chronic pain sufferers know that these problems come and go and can often strike out of the blue with an oil or pill based delivery system you can't customize your dosing for these difficult times when vaping you can smoke during those bad times to get relief and not use the vape as much or even at all when you are feeling well next up is the topic of safety there is one question people always ask about vaping and that is is it safe especially for non-smokers the thought of vaping isn't always comfortable so there are two things that we want to mention the first is that the long-term effects of baking either CBD or nicotine are not yet known unlike cigarettes there are a lot of chemicals in the liquids that are used to vape unfortunately doctors still aren't sure if that makes them much healthier for you the next is propylene glycol which is used as a thinning compound in many CBD hemp oils to dilute the oil enough to allow it to be baked the FDA considers propylene glycol safe for ingestion as a food additive the problem is that the substance becomes toxic at high temperatures and could cause damage to respiratory organs therefore it's best to use vape products that don't contain the substance if you're interested in a vape product that we trust we'll leave a link in the description below we've also put together a free ebook for you to download called the complete guide to CBD if you have any questions about CBD its uses or how to take it you'll find the answers there just go to WWE and health comm slash book to download it if you

videos welcome and if this is not your first time you checked out one of our past review videos thank you for coming back I am super excited about reviewing this brand new broad spectrum CBD topical from our good friends over at Pachamama CBD everyone meet the Pachamama CBD pain cream now this bad boy is made with 850 milligrams of THC free broad-spectrum CBD so there's no THC in it so you do not have to worry about that you know if you're getting drug tested or you know just you're just sensitive to THC or don't want it in all be Pachamama CBD pain cream this bad boy does not contain any so you are good to go now this Pachamama CBD pain cream you know of course the 850 milligrams of the broad spectrum CBD but that isn't the only incredible ingredient in this truly spectacular CBD topical from Pachamama CBD in addition to the 850 milligrams of broad spectrum CBD the Pachamama CBD pain cream contains you know ingredients like menthol and capsaicin and if I'm saying capsaicin wrong please drop a comment below in and correct me you know I believe I'm pronouncing it right but you know hey call me out if I'm not pronouncing it right I'd appreciate it so you know the with the menthol the cap says you know this all of these ingredients you know there's additional ingredients as well but you know all of these paired together give your body a break from discomfort in a chance to heal itself you know if you're dealing with chronic pain you know in flow nation or you know you're just dealing from muscle soreness from working out you know just living an active lifestyle I would really reach for this Pachamama CBD pain cream because you know with the ingredients like menthol that helps to cool the area causing causing relief and resulting in it and inhibiting the effect on pain which is exactly what you want you know that menthol helps cool that area and it really helps to inhibit the effect on pain whereas the capsaicin helps to block communication between the nerves and actually enhances blood flow you know to provide that relief to those specific areas throughout your body those inflamed areas you know get that blood flow going you don't want to have it backed up or anything so that's why you know the menthol the capsaicin are in there but that's not all guys you know so in addition there's ingredients like MSM arnica there is a invigorating frankincense so I mean this bad boy will has a high has a potential to help you combat your pain now with that said we cannot guarantee pain relieving effects or any effects at all in regards to the Pachamama CBD products or any of the CBD products available right now at Wella si.com and if you ever run into a CBD company that's trying to sell you a product by making medical claims they are breaking the law and they're trying to hide something or make up for a lack of something in their product so I would not recommend that you purchase from Vemma would run far away and guys if you're interested in the Pachamama CBD pain cream check the description section below or wait until the end of this video and I will give you guys an exclusive discount code that you can use the 15% off your first purchase of the patre mama CBD pain cream now one thing I do want to point out and I'm going to be filming more review videos they're gonna be after this one is the other Pachamama CBD topicals because pain cream isn't the only one you know they got the CBD body lotion which has 300 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in it then there's the icy muscle gel with 500 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in it so you know those also do not have the THC in them so you don't to worry about it but and then last but not least is the Pachamama athletic rub which has 500 milligrams in it but I do want to point out the Pachamama athletic rub this is actually made with a full-spectrum pep extract so it does contain the trace amounts of THC all right so keep an eye out for those upcoming review videos I'll be posting them on the YouTube channels so let's get back to the Pachamama CBD Pinklon you know some of its uses according to Pachamama is you know for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of sore muscles and joints that are associated with you know sprains arthritis simple back ache muscle strains bruises cramps so you know for you ladies if you deal with some very severe cramps you know that time of the month this the Pachamama CBD pain cream would be great because you know that's what's beautiful about topicals is you put it on your hand and you you apply it directly on a on a targeted on a targeted area for specific relief now that brings me my next thing that i want to bring up CBD topicals only provide the localized relief so wherever you apply the topical that's where it's going to provide relief if you really want to take it to the next level and not limit yourself to localized area or if you're experiencing you know pain internally or other parts of your body you could really leverage what I like to call the two prong approach which is you use something like a topical like the pot from AMA CBD pain cream for that localized relief and then you use something that you that you digest you know or internalize so something like an oil a teacher a edible a Capps or even a vape oil so when you do that that'll provide the whole body relief and then the topic of ride that localized relief so then I look at it this way it's like you're getting relief inside and outside of your body or whole body relief so I highly recommend that two-pronged approach you can combine it with take the Pachamama CBD pain cream and combine it with one the other Incredibles incredible full-spectrum CBD oil tinctures which if you're not aware of those I have a review video on the well se YouTube channel so check that out or you know you compare with one of the other hundreds of CBD products that are available right now at with ww-well SC com all right let's give the Pachamama CBD pain cream a go I'm super excited look at this bad boy so 850 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD in this 3.4 ounce bottle it's a nice like look at this cuz this is a nice hefty sized bottle you know that they definitely aren't shipping you on this and you know one thing that I do appreciate is Pachamama didn't make a super big bottle with low levels of you know CBD like in a lot of products I'll see them come out in a bottle size like this and there'll be 250 milligrams in it so then it's not very concentrated so you're having to use a lot you know just to get a semi decent amount of CBD each use whereas box Rama CD paint cream with 850 milligrams and you know each pump is fairly concentrated you know a lot more than a 250 milligrams in this exact same bottle so let's give this a go alright so smell that definitely could smell the menthol I don't know if it's like maybe the arnica in there that I'm smelling maybe the frankincense I think it's got like a boat but I definitely smell the menthol for sure alright so I'll show you guys what it looks like so as this nice little air pump bottle you know keep this in your backpack you know your purse a disc in the locker room you know I mean you could put it in your pocket but it is kind of big so alright let's look at this so if you guys take a look at this it has a beautiful actually nice peach color associated with it okay I mean I put a pretty generous amount on you know experiencing some I've been sleeping on my neck really weird lately I think it's just like I move and I'm weird and I end up like waking up with a sore neck and you know it leads to knots and then that causes headache and it's just like a never-ending pain cycle so you know I'm gonna put some on my neck and kind of my lower shoulders and you know experience a little dry skin so we'll see what it kind of does for the moisturization aspect of it all right so you know just rub it in like this and you would just do this on wherever you're experiencing pain so you know right now I'm experiencing a little bit of you know the tightness in my shoulders all the / lower neck and then also kind of my upper neck so I'm applying it generously all across my neck and I'm maybe gonna put some of my shoulders you know so definite okay the menthol is already in action I can feel the cooling sensation in like I debit it like I was kind of getting a mixture of I think three scents but like now like that I've applied it and you know it's in action on my hand I do smell menthol but it's nothing like I see I you know it's not like I don't really like some of ice yet I'm not a big fan of it it kind of smells like alcohol II and just like I don't know I I don't like it and like this just like you could smell the menthol but like it's not like it's not like hitting you in the face but I will say as this Pachamama CBD pain cream you know it starts to go to work on my neck I feel like I'm getting a more potent scent of the menthol but it's still not like medicine the type smelling you know it it's a very refreshing scent and it's not like overpowering and I mean somebody I see out on like I I like it it's a very nice smelling you know it's kind of relaxing honestly and I mean it's that menthol is going to work I feel like the menthol just gets like stronger and stronger and stronger as it as it sits and starts to go to work on my on my neck or wherever you would apply it you know so I this scent I was just hoping that it was gonna smell like eyes yeah and it does not smell like that I believe like I think I am getting kind of a little bit of the arnica type smell us with the menthol which is really really nice and you know this Pachamama see this pain cream is a cooling topical formula with oils and herbs and compounds that work with your body to provide temporary relief from minor joint and muscle eggs soreness and overall discomfort so you know I'll kind of see towards the end of this video if you know you won't go to work like that I mean it's starting to work but I mean I'm not gonna like immediately display oh and all the pain is gone you know it'll take a little bit and you know for you of this your first time using CBD you know some people sure some people do report experiencing effects after their first use but some people you know they can take up to it can take a week but sometimes I and I recommend this for all of you this year first I'm taking a CVT product give it a full month of use before you decide if it's for you or not because sometimes it can take that long for the cannabinoids to build up in your endocannabinoid system to start working and providing that homeostasis you know the balance and equilibrium because that is the whole purpose of your endocannabinoid system and it being in charge of you know internal bodily functions that's its number one goal is promote homeostasis balance equilibrium so you know and if you feel relief after your first user even if you feel relief at all you know don't just stop using the CBD product because guess what if you stop using it the issues are gonna come back so it's something like if this works for you if like this Pachamama c be praying cream helps you treat your pain make sure using it regularly don't just stop using it you know and it's important that you just you use it and you need to look at CBD kind of like a daily multivitamin you know those wanted day gummies that you take you know you take those every day you don't take those every other day or once a week and say well I'm good you need to look at CBD products the exact same way it's very very important alright guys so I will say so off the scent I would give it on a on a scent scale of one to ten you know I'm I'm gonna put that in a 75 I really like that it's a little more menthol e than I was expecting but it's not like god-awful like the icy hot sore some of the other kind of menthol containing products that see you know in the past and it's great because the Pachamama cvd pain creams made with a broad spectrum hemp extract you know so you don't have to worry about having any trace amounts of the THC you know because THC is of course what they're looking for in regards to a drug test and I will say about this they menthol kind of intensive nassif you know like when I do that you know I I can feel the cooling but like it's kind of calmed down for sure but I will say it really moisturize my skin like my neck you know my lip my shoulder my shoulders were a little dry and you know that's an additional benefit that I got from it is I've noticed you know my skin isn't as dry and itchy at least on the direct the specific areas that I applied it on and that cooling action is starting to really really relax my neck so you know for me I am noticing some and I'm noticing some effects starting to work now I would have to continuously use this you know over and over you know for a month like I just said at least a month for me to be able to say like okay this really this helped with my pain but I can tell you like it is starting to you know loosen up some of that soreness and everything you know because I did come back on here and I kind of cut the video so here I am sort of you know about used it about 30 minutes ago and it is starting to work you know I I do feel it loosening up my neck and kind of adduced like my Ranger I'm not as stiff as I was before so you know so far I like it you know but it's up to you that you you need to experience this for yourself because even if you and I are treating the exact same pain just because I get relief does not necessarily mean that you will experience relief so it's very important that you that you try these products but also experience you know find a dosage that works for you but then start experimenting with different types of deliveries you know like a topical or an oil or using that two-pronged approach guys I'd really recommend that you do that use the Pachamama CBD pain cream and then you know you could also use one of the Pachamama CBD oil or you know one of the well SC CBD tinctures you know or vape it capsule you know just try it out guys but I highly recommend this pain cream I love the potency of this 850 milligrams of broad-spectrum CBD and this whole thing and it's like I said a 3.4 ounce bottle so you know it's not you're not going to go through it like that I mean it depends on how frequently you're using it but it is a good amount of lotion and then also a fantastic amount of CBD now guys if you check the description below at the end of this video or I'll put it up on the screen right here if you head on over to www.hsn.com and that about wraps it up for the Pacha mama CBD pain cream review i had

really excited i don't know why i'm just i'm very excited about this one let's get more into detail and i'll show you how everything works in the shower ready so now it's the time we've all been waiting for shower time don't come for me for my outdated shower i'm still renovating my house thank you okay the main thing that i wanted to exfoliate was my stretch marks because they are my biggest insecurities so i went ahead and took that cbd scrub and scrubbed away i noticed that if you added water to the scrub it kind of emulsified it i started off trying it with dry skin and then i tried it with wet skin emulsified better with wet skin obviously i always pat to dry that's what my mama taught me so i teach you quick comparison so i already own this one but this one i noticed leaves my skin a lot softer kind of reminds me of this if you like this you'll love this and then i got out of the shower and headed to better lighting and tried the oil i put it on my chest my shoulders and my booty i have like a really dry chest so i wanted to try it out you can see it glisten and it really really worked calmed me down i was loving it i noticed while using it it quickly absorbed which was awesome and my skin lightly glistened and then when i used it on my booty it almost seemed like it instantly firmed my stretch marks which is pretty awesome so you have to dance to that then when applying the lotion it also quickly absorbed i think the two combo of the oil and the lotion is so dance worthy don't judge the appearance i was working all day took my makeup off and tried the face oil kind of hard to give a first reaction face care product i think i mean hey we'll see what happens right this is just like a vlog part of it so i just tried the oil and the lotion like for the first time and i was taking clips the application i was really really stressed out earlier this morning about all the things that i had to do today when using the oil and the lotion i like instantly was super calm knew that i would get all of my stuff done with this product it has completely like just not super anxious and worried about everything that i have to do just knowing that i can do it they wanted me to be honest and i've already told my mom about this product because i think she would benefit i've tried cbd before but never in like a lotion form or with sativa and i just i don't know i really highly recommend this probably my favorite julie product i've ever tried for sure not probably for sure that is basically it for the truly beauty shower with me edition thank you guys so

pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "6g4i5dJoDxQ": "hey so I'm sitting out on the porch and doing this amazing fall weather with the kids I figured I'd just hop on and give you all a quick CBD review interested in trying to bait CBD I didn't wanna buy a pod system I know there's a lot of there's a lot of brands who make evade currently with the situation with this vitamin e has actually took one of my favorite brands off the market um so I figured okay well I'll try this I've seen them in my local vape shop so they got some some type of clout with me I mean I wouldn't be there if they weren't safe it wouldn't be there if it wasn't same so this is an additive and basically what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to drop a few drops in there with your favorite illiquid today I'm using vape Crusaders pumpkin cheesecake enjoying this amazing fall weather and just really trying to D it dive deep into the season I filled it up about half away in my wrap I filled it up about half way with a liquid [Music] in my ballon tank I got a fresh coil in there using my eyes IVP Mon and I'm running at about at 80 watt summit comes in this little bottle I got the 500 milligram 10 milligram so that basically that just um probably would equal out to 50 milligrams 50 milligrams a milliliter and I'm honestly I'm not even using that much so I'd say I'm probably not using about about 30 milligrams and then I'll just give it a quick shake get all shook shook shift together and as you can see since I've been vaping it my tank has gotten this all I can sort of say is it's like a resin from the town my tank looks with grimy as hell so I'm definitely gonna recommend that if you're going to use this with a set item tank that you have one for your CBD and one for your illiquid or at least for one when you go out in public cuz it's just really unclean looking anyway I got this yesterday and I've used quite a lot of it I love it it's cool spectrum I use it first C&D C&D I use these hip products for a lot of reasons so I like to have all the parts of the plant but I can consume lately in my products I'm really glad I found this as again they took a few products off the market let's see how it makes vapes great there's no burnt flavor as you can see the only problem I really have is with it turning my tank or residue looking so I definitely I will be using another tank for this and another tank for my everyday use and it just it tastes like pumpkin cheesecake [Music] and this is how I stay home with two under two with two under three so I've had about a few hits off of it I'm kind of done with it if you're not gonna see me all day I guess it's not a great product just like it I would have probably been better off getting the e-liquid because I didn't know that I'd have to make so much of it [Music] but again this is another reason I'll probably be using another tank with it and another tank for my everyday is so just to be you know summarize everything the CBD FX babe additive works great there's no vitamin E oil in there to be worried about as its it is this is being sold in vape shop they clearly are a popular brand a safe friend [Music] the only thing bad I have to say about it is just use another tang are you're gonna get all resin II quite happy with my CBD FX [Music]", "vBpEXUoB8GQ": "hey what's up tubers welcome back thank you guys so much for tuning into today's video I am so sorry about my voice I'm just now getting over being sick and I'm finally getting my voice back but it's still a little bit scratchy so please try to ignore it I'm so freaking excited for today's video because we are gonna be discussing and testing out the latest health trend CBD hemp is a type of cannabis plant that contains a chemical called CBD it doesn't make you high like marijuana but it is creating a national buzz CBD CBD CBD sprouting up everywhere and in everything to put a simply CBD is a component of the cannabis plant with enormous healing potential you can get the benefits of CBD in so many different forms like oils edibles coffee even skin care and so many more now I personally found out about CBD last year whenever I broke my wrist snowboarding I'm sure you guys already know the story with that but after my surgery the doctors prescribed me some really hard drugs to help me cope with the pain and even though the pain was so unbearable I could not stand the side effects of the drugs so I had to start doing some research into more natural ways of relieving my chronic pain and I came across CBD oils and I've been using them ever since it's really cool because it helps you with so many other things like relieving stress anxiety migraines and it even improves my sleep when I first thought I'm doing a video like this I was just gonna use CBD oil for a whole week and kind of see what it does but since I already have a really positive experience using CBD oils I wanted to dive in into a different way of using CBD without actually ingesting it so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my experience of using a CBD cream for a whole week now there are so many different CBD brands out there and it's kind of hard to find one that you can truly trust that is organically grown the most trusted brand I've tried so far is premium Jane they provide some of the most purest safest and most effective products in the industry they are sourced from a hundred percent or grown Oregon hemp which if you didn't know I live in Oregon and we're kind of known to grow some of the best hemp out there anyways I'll be using this CBD topical solve from premium Jane you can call it assault and pointman a cream whatever I think I was gonna go with the cream it's much easier for me to say but this contains 1500 milligrams of CBD and it has some other really incredible ingredients like eucalyptus essential oil Joba oil argan oil emu oil grapeseed oil Omega 3 and 6 oils soy protein hibiscus flower extract neem leaf extract lemongrass extract chamomile extract aloe vera extract and cocoa butter these are all-natural and very powerful ingredients and I'm kind of excited to see what it can do to my skin so I started applying this every single day on my face and on my wrist [Music] I have a metal plate and screws in there that's holding the bone together and since I live in Oregon this time of year it gets super cold and the aching pain in my wrist gets so bad this cream is pretty powerful as a high dose of CBD so as soon as I started rubbing this on my wrist I kid you not the aching pain went away almost immediately and I do use CBD oils for this kind of pain but that takes a little bit longer to kick in it was really insane to me that I got immediate relief whenever I applied this cream now I didn't really see much of a difference in my skin other than some of the redness and breakouts were definitely reduced and my skin did feel a lot more hydrated and supple but I did notice a huge improvement in my lips I have this terrible habit of biting my lips and I would get these little pieces of broken skin on the outer corners of my lips because you know I feel like this oh well all of that is completely healed from just using this for one week and then that whole eyelash extension thing happened I just got out of the shower and I'm so embarrassed to share this with you guys but I have to because I am convinced this is a miracle CBD cream last night I was washing my face my eyelash extensions were kind of in the way and I don't know where I just started like pulling them out and not just the lash extensions but my real lashes too because you know the extensions is stuck to the lashes whoo I literally pulled out so many of my lashes I barely have any on oh so my eyes swole up they were so red so inflamed they were burning so much pain so what do I do I take the CBD bomb and I started applying it all over my eyelids and almost immediately the inflammation started going down and it felt so soothing this especially it was so bad like you could still kind of see the redness and the puffiness but I was shocked at how quickly the CBD balm work the next morning I woke up my eyes were not swollen anymore they look good again except for this one damn I still feel really dumb for pulling out my eyelashes but it happened I'm so glad I had something like this on hand to help treat it oh another thing my daughter brought her fingers she was trying to help me cook and she accidentally touched the pan and had a little burn around her fingers what did I do I put this on in a couple seconds and the pain went away so good stuff overall I experienced many benefits using this cream I think this is something every household should have just in case of an emergency like I mentioned this helps treat my daughter's minor burn better than anything else I'm blown away with the benefits I've received just by using it for one week I love this little jar of magical healing cream and will continue to use it every single day I've already ordered a couple more jars to stock up just in case I run out if you're wanting to get your hands on this you know where to find it I will also leave the link down below I really enjoyed filming this video for you guys I hope you found it helpful if you're feeling generous today please subscribe I'd love to have you be a part of my channel and I cannot wait to see you in my next video bye [Music]", "PaaRAX9s0Dk": "do you know your medicine weedmaps and SC laboratories bring you an educational series on the science of clean and safe cannabis today's cannabinoid profile is on Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol hi I'm dr. Bonnie Goldstein and I've been educating patients about cannabis for a number of years and today I'm going to talk a little bit about Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol it's the most prominent compound found in the cannabis plant it was discovered in 1964 by researchers in Israel cannabis has been used for many many years thousands of years but nobody knew exactly what was in it in fact that same group continues to do research in cannabis to the state THC starts out in the plant as journey or phosphate and I'll Tolec acid through of enzyme catalyzed reaction at the general phosphate in the olive Tolec acid are catalyzed to Canada Borelli bassett or CBG a Cena GA is the precursor to several the cannabinoids to make THC go through the pathway catalyzed by another enzyme called the THC synthase it allows the CBG a to become thca or tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid the THC a has very different effects than the THC now key or over time the THC a candy carboxylate into th see this carboxylic acid when there's this compound virtually non psychoactive and what's interesting about THC or Delta 9 THC is that so many different effects on humans and in about the 1990s or so it was found that humans have cannabinoid receptors and there have been two identified cb1 and cb2 and THC binds to these receptors causing a change in function of the cell where it's binding so what are some of the effects or changes that we see with THC THC is well known to turn off nausea it turns off the vomiting it also appears to trigger appetite it also appears to have effects as anti-inflammatory in fact it's been found to be 20 times stronger than aspirin and it's also been found to be two times stronger than hydrocortisone a well-known steroid that people use it's been found to be a strong antioxidant there was a study out of Harvard that talked about these mice that had these large tumor loads and by giving them THC the tumor and I believe they were lung cancer cells were reduced in half there's also was a study in humans where THC actually reduced or decreased the tumor cells for this specific type of brain cancer THC has been found to be helpful for patients with PTSD post traumatic stress disorder and there are a number of current studies going on right now working specifically at using THC to treat PTSD THC has also been found to help patients with Tourette syndrome and threats is very difficult to treat overall because the medications that can help often have very significant side effects especially in young people and so THC was studied and they found that the patients had overall less tics and less urges se lab to test for THC using an HPLC also known as a high-performance liquid chromatograph there's basically two methods out there to test for THC in cannabis some people use in hplc other people use a GC the problem with the GC or gas chromatograph is that at the process actually heats the cannabis up and measures that based on the boiling point of the different constituents in in the resin picture trying to weigh a piece of paper by setting it on fire and placing it on a scale problem with that is is you're going to lose some of your sensitivity because the paper is changing as you're actually trying to measure it so that's why we choose to use hplc the test for THC and all the other cannabinoids no one has ever overdosed on THC and the reason being is that you do not have these receptors the cb1 and cb2 receptors located anywhere in the brain stem the brain stem controls breathing and heart rate if the THC doesn't bind in that area it cannot change or turn off similar to things like opioid and so we do not see that with THC usually a quote overdose of THC causes a patient to have excessive anxiety they have a sense of what's called perceived harm they think something bad is going to happen to them they're a really a node medical danger today's cannabinoid profile is on tetrahydrocannabinol thca is another cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant THC a stands for tetrahydrocannabinol acid cannabis actually produces carboxylic acids as opposed to the non aesthetic forms like tht so when you hear of THC implants there's actually very little tht implants it's mostly thca thca is actually not psychoactive with heat or with time the THC a will convert into THC and that's what psychoactive so only smoked cannabis we're smoking thca but the heat is actually turning that THC a in a THC and that's what's giving people the psychoactive effects that we come to expect from cannabis tea HCA has been found to have its own medicinal properties in that it's anti-inflammatory and it appears to modulate the immune system meaning it can suppress it or enhance it what's interesting about thca is that it can be measured by medical cannabis testing and it does allow for a patient to know the total amount of THC that's in the plant so usually when one gets their medical testing results on a certain plant the THC a will be expressed in percentage and let's just say it's about sixteen percent and then the THC may be in a very small amount but overall added together that's what gives you the potency of THC we have a drawing of basically the synthetic pathway that THC a takes so we start out with geranyl pyrophosphate and alcoholic acid they combine to form what's called can achieve a relic acid and other ascitic cannabinoid and the Kennedy relic acid or CBG a basically folds in upon itself and form rings which gives us the final structure using the THC a synthase enzyme to form thca and THC a we have done here is very similar to THC the only difference is this carboxylic acid group that's attached to the THC a so when heat occurs or over time that carboxylic acid will release as a co2 and will be just left with THC now interestingly when one tests medical care an abyss in a lab there are different methods and the method that many labs use is called gas chromatography now unfortunately gas chromatography requires heating up of the plant so what happens is the THC a actually gets decarboxylated in the lab that's why we use hplc because we feel that the acidic cannabinoids play a very important role and knowing the ratio between the THC a and THC it is important for judging the quality of the cannabis as well as the effects the cannabis is going to have on a patient so it is very important and in with other products such as edibles or our non inhaled products it's much more important because as I said thca has very different properties physiologically as well as psychologically then the THC it's very important no of those numbers in the non inhaled products so you actually have a very accurate measurement of the THC that's in the plan there's a nearly enough study that's gone into th CA or some of these other acidic cannabinoids the the studies that have been done show very great promise in in and the possibilities of these acidic cannabinoids and different administration routes and stuff like that so hopefully with it the work we're doing here at SC labs bringing awareness of these compounds and showing people what the what compounds are actually aiming their medicine will bring you out about that awareness and we'll be able to inspire people to pick up the torsion and carry it further and get this research done and start start finding out exactly what what benefits these compounds can have but there needs to be a lot more research today's can happen the profile is on tetrahydrocannabinol th TV or tetrahydrocannabinol annoyed found in the cannabis plant and it appears to have an interesting reaction with the cb1 receptor at low doses it blocks the receptor and at higher doses it binds to the receptor and what they found in lab studies with mice is that when it walks it causes weight loss and decrease body fat and increase energy expenditure in these mice appears to have the opposite effect of THC at these low doses it's very similar to THC except for a few minor chemical constituents but it actually starts from a whole different process than the tetrahydrocannabinol that we're used to our THC that we're used to mostly cannabinoids that we've all heard of page CCB CBC started from a combination of journal pyrophosphate and opt oleic acid whereas THC V we're studying with diet their knowledge acid and the only difference really is the guy very knowledge acid has two less carbons than the olive dalek acid so it's different in that sense that one of those like starting materials is slightly different th TV is phone and a lot of African landrace plants some of them have amounts of THC beads also psychoactive similar to th see the effects are described slightly different is more of a psychedelic hi the two compounds combine the enzymatic process to form an average air ovarian acid or CBGB a CBGB a synthesizes to th TV and through an enzymatic process using the THC V a synthesis enzyme so tht VA is is very similar to th TV except for it has this carboxylic acid group attached to it and now with heat or over time this carboxylic acid will release from the molecule and then you'll have th cv as I said it's very similar th see if you did this you would have th see th TV has also been found to be again in lab studies with mice to have some anticonvulsant properties in that it appears to lower the seizure threshold for this noise there's not very many studies on th CB and I do know that it's being studied in many labs right now certainly it holds some medicinal benefits and it would be great to have more studies so that we could what its properties are you feel the minor cannabinoids are very important to patients and we're looking to to get patients as much information as possible so we can make the most informed decisions possible so they will be coming very soon from su ABS today's cannabinoid profile as on cannabidiol cannabidiol or CBD for short is the second most prominent compound found in the cannabis plant a lot of the medical benefits of cannabis that our tribute to THC or other cannabinoids are actually due to the CBD content of the cannabis has very strong anti-inflammatory properties and not only does it help suppress inflammation but there was a study that showed that it also helps the body to not make the chemical that causes inflammation so it actually has somewhat of a preventive role cannabidiol has also been found to have anticonvulsant properties in that it can reduce the seizure threshold for a number of patients I've had my own patients who have said that once they started using CBD rich strains they have found that they have had less episodes of their seizures CD is synthesizing the plant through the same pathways as THC CDC it sets out as geranyl pyrophosphate and alcoholic acid those two compounds joined together through an enzyme catalyzed reaction Kennedy boric acid CBG a is the starting material for CBD a th CA and CB CA so cbda synthase if it's found in large enough amounts will take this can of gibberellic acid and make them too cannabidiol carboxylic acid which is CBD a CD a is CBD with a carboxylic acid attached to it now with heat or a few time this carboxylic acid will naturally release from the compound as it is very unstable and become CBD this process right here where we lose this carboxylic acid happens at about 80 degrees Celsius number of studies were done where they actually patience and overdose of THC to see what would happen when they then added CBD and CBD completely turned around the negative effects of an overdose of THC without changing the levels of THC in the blood so that means that CBD exerts its own medicinal just doesn't reverse THC it actually has its own medicinal properties CBD has been found to cause cancer cells to what we call commit suicide while preserving the normal cells and what appears to happen is it appears to bind to the receptors on the cancer cells which then induce the cancer cell to kill itself cannabidiol has also been found to be what we call biphasic in terms of sleep so at low doses it's what we call alerting it kind of keeps you awake at higher doses it can be very sedating and cause you to sleep but what's nice about that is you can control whether or not we were alert or you feeling tired when I start testing cannabis about 2 or 3 years ago we saw virtually no high CBD plants almost every plant we tested was high in THC anywhere from ten percent to twenty percent k HC with some outliers on either end some plants would have a one-percent CBD at the max one and a half percent CBD at the max now that we've been testing for a while we see anywhere from eight to fifteen percent CBD and maybe five or six percent THC and B strains some strains we get a 50-50 ratio it can happen in all different ratios but what it is is it's a recessive gene in plants so we have breeders have to activate it go and try and breed this back into this class and find these high THC plants that might have that high CBD gene locked away and bring them together and see what they find it and really the only way you can know it is tested with testing and growers Arab leaders having access to that knowledge base we see them coming back in reversing some of the trends in the last 30 40 50 years and inbreeding the CD back into the plants now there have been a number of studies that have looked at cannabidiol CBD exerting a protective property to damaged neurons and it appears that in the studies CBD protects the nerves by inhibiting the process by which nerves are damaged CBD has also been shown to protect against brain injury when patients or lab animals have had a brain injury CBD appears to protect the brain from damage that occurred to the nerve cells the studies have shown that it can actually fight mr SI which is methicillin-resistant Staph aureus a notorious bug that is resistant to a number of antibiotics a topical application of cannabis was able to fight the infection and the mrs a was eradicated from that infection site st labs tests for cvd with a high-performance liquid chromatograph also known as an HPLC there's two different ways you can test for cannabinoids it's either with an HPLC or with the GC if you hear someone testing with other methods it's probably not scientifically validated method but with the problem with the GC is is that GC uses heat to test for these these cannabinoids and as I said earlier all the acidic cannabinoids are very sensitive to heat so the GC can give you no information about the acidic cannabinoids you can only tell you about the non aesthetic can add rights the heat is decomposing these compounds it's definitely decarboxylated all of them and you're trying to measure it as these compounds are in a state of flux and that's just it's kind of fuzzy so we use the hplc because it keeps the cannabinoids in their natural state they're in their liquid state there's no alteration there's no heat or anything like that happening and so you get a much more accurate and a much more realistic picture of what's actually in the sample that we're testing one of the important things for people to understand about cannabidiol is it is not psychoactive that means it does not change your mood or mentation the way that THC has psychoactive properties and can actually cause what we call the high CBD does not do that for patients who are not interested in the THC effect but are interested in the CBD effect this is a terrific choice for them to have in today's episode dr. Bonnie Goldstein visits SC laboratories to take a closer look at CBD hey Josh don't do it good it's good to see you again I was really excited to come back and maybe we could talk about CBD today cannabidiol has been something that a lot of my patients been asking about and I just wanted to see we really get a chance to look all right it's really exciting haven't seen a lot of high CBD strains coming through the lab so let's go back and i'll show you some results alright sounds good Bonnie I'm really go ahead stop by I've got some interesting things to show you we've had a lot of high CBD samples coming through the web all right I can't wait to see it so here's an example of the majority of plants we see in equals up to 16 point two percent total THC and point nine percent of total CBD and that's that's representative of good 99% of plans we'll see coming through the doors maybe half a percent cvd up to one and a half percent CBD so in comparison take a look at a high CBD strain this is a harlech in a high CBD strain we have five and a half five point two percent total THC and 11.3 percent total cv these used to be very rare we're starting to see them a lot more so why is it that the THC is so like lo part will be for testing readers would breathe selectively just for THC content we don't you see fifteen percent THC in fifteen percent cvd plant still seems to only be able to make so much resin well and I know from scientific studies that I've looked at that CBD is not psychoactive so for a person who got some inflammatory condition or some type of other illness who wants to use medical marijuana they may find that if they're a person who doesn't want the effects of THC that a high CBD strain is going to give them that medicinal effect without giving them Fauria or lethargy or whatever it is that they get from the THC see that is hello oh she's here okay great just so happens I think we have a guest who might be very relevant to the conversation we're having right now that's Gracie let's go talk to her Sarah it's great to see you again yeah Bonnie this is Sarah Reese open project CD oh honey great to meet you as well so tell me all about product cvd sir well project CBD were an educational news service and we focus on the reintroduction of CBD as a news story over a year we eventually seeing that dispensaries begun caring and patients have begun using it they you know really like an option that's more functional they can care about their day so you know I've done a lot of reading about CBD and you know if you get kind of amazed that something could have so many benefits and so the things that I've read about is you know anti-inflammatory with my patients anti-anxiety it has antipsychotic and also can balance out if somebody has too much effect from THC will balance out the THC effect neuroprotection and anti compulsive and medic antispasmodic you know what stop spasms I mean it's just it's amazing that one medicine will be able to do so many things CBD and THC work synergistically and they both anti-tumor properties as well yeah and I believe there's a study coming out shortly where they've been looking at veterans who've been suffering with be great results to check out we actually work very closely with an organization called fam which is the veterans alliance for medical marijuana and they've been working with their patients who are all veterans and many of whom are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder they've been having great results with the ICD rich medicine just just in helping to alleviate some of that anxiety some of these vets are feeling when I was on your website checking out project CBD and I saw that there's a survey for patients can you tell me about that so the Society of catalyst Commission's has created the first real-world study on the effectiveness of cvd because previously with CBD there been clinical trials or laboratory situations it was done in a test tube or with mice and then clinical trials there's been a couple but you know what controlled setting and so this is the first real world study and it's examining patients in their normal everyday life and so we work on in conjunction with a side of endless clinicians and we promote their survey and also where we encourage patients anybody who is interested in CBD to contribute news and information tabs if you're a grower we want to hear about it what are you growing if you have a new strain that just been tested the lab and one about that too we couldn't be doing the work we're doing without the whole CBD topic actually is what makes me really excited to be part of the testing industry with testing a lot of times we kind of fall in the trap both what's the highest THC string and cvd and somebody's other minor cannabinoids it's great to be able to to show patience that's not just about the highest THC score there's other reasons to test and and it's an honourable give patients you know that that accurate information so that they know what they're getting it is exciting to be a part of that I had a patient who 75 years old and she's cannabis naive she's never used it before and I saw her about six weeks after she saw me I thought she was going to be unhappy with her results and that's why she came back to see me but she actually came back to tell me that she now was on three medications and now she had much more mobility because the went down so i think it's just terrific when we have all this information but you know we need to get it out there to the patients i'm really excited about all this this is great between testing the medicine and educating people on CBD I feel like just tremendous progress is being made it really is all about educating people and they can actually make really good decisions about their own health about a loved one's health and you know really it's about improving the quality of life thank you all for stopping by Sara was great to see you again write to me Sarah we chose Ohio may be in touch today's cannabinoid profile is on a nap at home can a banal or cbn is another cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant and it appears to result from a breakdown of THC so it's considered a breakdown product it's following the plant in varying amounts it's a little bit different than some of the other cannabinoids and the fact that it's not naturally synthesized by the plan for it's more of a breakdown or degradation product or a metabolite of THC cbn is psychoactive and it's what gives mostly sedative effect of cannabis you hear a lot of indica versus sativa cbn is actually what's making you sleepy and CBN can be found in any cannabis it's produced over time or with heat so older cannabis or quiet canvas that's been stored for a long time is going to have a high level of CDN it also appears to work as an anticonvulsant it has antibacterial properties and it also has anti-inflammatory properties it also appears to stimulate osteocytes which are bone cells it's being looked at for treatment of bone disorders such as osteoporosis it also appears to inhibit skin cell formation and some people say that this may have some benefit down the line once we really understand what it's doing in skin disorders such as psoriasis I'll show you how CBN synthesized in the plant CBN starts with j real pyrophosphate now folic acid like most of the cannabinoids those two come together an enzyme catalyzed reaction the for canada relic acids EVGA and see BGA folds upon itself into rings and makes th CA with using THC a synthase which is an enzyme the THC a decarboxylase we leave that carboxylic acid right there and form THC THC over time or with heat will be grade into cbn and all that's happening is is where we're losing hydrogen atoms and forming double bonds in this room right here that causes a weaker interaction for this compound with the cd1 and cb2 receptors that weak interaction is what leads to the sedative effect and in the sleepiness drowsiness associated with CBM when cannabis is tested in a testing facility CBN can be measured and usually it's under 1% a patient can actually look to see if that's something that they're interested in a higher percent or lower percent because it does cause sedation SC labs test for CBN using a high-performance liquid chromatograph I also known as an HPLC the hplc is much more sensitive instrument than the other instrument that seems to test for cannabinoids sometimes called the GC or gas chromatograph we use the hplc because it doesn't create any of these compounds like the GC the GCS is heat sort degrades some of these compounds whereas hplc can test them in their natural state the hplc is what's accepted by international and union cops Drugs and Crime does pharmacopeia the Dutch oven using hplc for quite a while my testimony's paranoids what happens with the GC so we've established that that the cbn is formed by either heater time same thing with with the decarboxylation of this tht comment about 140 degrees Celsius we start to see a conversion of THC to CBN where the GCS must operate a much higher temperatures so when we do a test for with the GC for these cameras you're going to have a slightly lower CBD number because the CBD with heat will actually can be converted to THC with heat the THC can then be converted to CBN switching to see a slightly lower CBD numbers it's kind of a wash with THC you might get a slightly lower number and then with CBN you're going to see a higher number than you will with HCMC testing now is that CBN actually the plant no it's a function of the heating process look at you see and since THC and CBD are degraded with heat that's why we test for all of our cannabinoids with an HPLC at SC labs to get a more accurate and precise measurement of what's actually found in the plan today's cannabinoid profile is on cnabi geral cannabis geral or CBG is a cannabinoid that's found in the cannabis plant that is actually what we call the precursor to THC and CBD so it's the first compound that's made there's an enzymatic reaction which then leads it to be made to change into THC or to change into CBD sort of the stem cell you'd say of all the other cannabinoids found in the plant it can form THC conform CVC conform CBD and even some other minor cannabinoids it's never really found in very high amounts implants because as soon as it's created it's sent along a chemical pathway to form another one of these cannabinoids but in its isolated form it's definitely has a lot of medical potential it's a very very strong anti-inflammatory it hibits gaba uptake and so gaba is a neurotransmitter in your brain and when it's gaba is inhibited you actually have muscle relaxation and you have anti-anxiety effect so it appears to promote similar effects that CBD has it also appears to have antidepressant properties and it also appears to have some modest antifungal properties a lot is not known about the medicinal properties of CBG as it occurs in very small amounts and usually is not isolated out to be tested on its own but it appears that it works in conjunction with the other cannabinoids to give that overall synergistic effect that people get with medical marijuana use here we have the synthetic pathway for CBG a you start out with jariel pyrophosphate and out of taluk acid and those two join together to form kind of gibberellic acid and here here is the the structure of Kennedy of relic acid we see the coh which makes it the acid if that were to disappear then it would just be playing CBG and we can see this long chain of carbon molecules which is able to roll up in different ways and enroll upon itself and form rings and other structures which lead to CBD a th CA and CB CA so when we have undifferentiated CBG a what enables this molecule right here to become CBD or THC or cbc are enzymes and enzymes are sort of helpers to help catalyze these different reactions that have to occur in plants and animals normally chemical reactions occur under extreme conditions lots of heat very acidic conditions very basic conditions but in the body we have these enzymes which sort of grab the molecule on this case CBG a and kind of form it into the new molecule and make make that energy that it takes to form the next molecule much lower than if it were just by itself so the enzymes become the limiting factor or the decision maker and what is formed next if the plant makes a lot of THC a synthase then we're going to get a lot of THC the plant decides to make a lot of cvd this we're gonna get a lot of CBD so the way we can play around with the different levels of cannabinoids is by altering the amounts of these different enzymes in the plant that can be occur through breeding it can occur through genetic manipulation whatever it may be with the legal restrictions placed on cannabis and other restrictions there hasn't been a lot of real good research done on CBG in these other minor cannabinoids hopefully worth the work as the labs is doing you will see more breeders and more cannabis patients and more researchers all take note that there's more in cannabis than just THC and some of these other compounds are very very interesting compounds they're all bioactive so hopefully we can we can help spur some of that knowledge and to really finish on this research that needs to be done and unlock some of the mysteries of these these minor cannabinoids today's cannabinoid profile is on and have a pro cannabic romijn also known as CBC is the third cannabinoid that is synthesized from CVG in the plant less common to find a lot of CBC than then CBD or THC and it's been found to have anti-inflammatory properties as well as analgesic meaning pain-killing properties although a little bit weaker than THC it's also been found to have antifungal effects and antibacterial effects in lab studies with rodents to have anti-tumor effects meaning it kills cancer cells and certainly that part of Kennewick roaming needs to be studied further and right now there are studies going on looking at cannabinoids in killing cancer cells CBC is produced in the same chemical pathways THC and starts out with Sharia pyrophosphate an olive Tolec acid combined to form Kennedy relic acid which is CG a cv GA is the precursor to see me da th CA and CB CA what happens is Kennedy boric acid through an enzyme catalyzed reaction and what enzymes do is allow these reactions to take place at normal room temperature or body temperature whatever it may be and what happens here is the character arc s is going to fold over upon itself and and this carbon atom is going to attach over here and form cbca and what makes it an acid is this carboxylic acid group that's attached to her now as carboxylic acid group is not very stable over time or very quickly with heat it'll kick itself off and disappear and leave leave us carbon dioxide and you'll have your CDC another interesting thing about cannibal armies it appears to inhibit the uptake of an and amide which prolongs its life in the body prolonging its effects and we know an and amide has very good effects because it binds at the same receptors that the cannabinoids going to cannabis roaming has also been found to have antidepressant properties here we have a three-dimensional representation of CBC we have the two rings the black balls represent carbon atoms the red balls represent oxygen atoms and the white balls are hydrogens that are attached to each structure is quite a bit different as I said then then THC or CBD we don't have that folding in and and the ring structure is much different but it's the same amount of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen atoms it's just rearranged differently bonds at place in different areas patients normally don't use cbc to determine their medication they're really looking more at THC CBD and CBN but we do know that this cannabinoid has many benefits and certainly warrants much more study today's cannabinoid profile is on term so terpenes are the main class of aromatic compounds that are found in cannabis and an aromatic compound first of all way back when when scientist refers to classifying compounds though or use some rather ad-hoc methods to do that and aromatics got their name because they will have pleasant aroma that they kind of compounds that you'd find in cinnamon ginger pine trees as these compounds that are responsible for the smell of marijuana smoker for example the cannabis plant produces several terpenoids that you know give it you know yet cannabis plants that smell like bubblegum grade lemon spices so cannabis is really an interesting plant the fact that can produce a wide range of turbulence the main terpenoids in cannabis are mersin lemony carry a clean and pyrene additionally they will contain this kind of structure which is this is the very most simple aromatic compound which we call benzene has the formula c6h6 it's easy to imagine how we replaced one or more hydrogen atoms in this compound with other organic fragments you can build up a whole series of different compounds generally referred to as aromatics they're all somewhat similar to the cannabinoids and chemical structure so they can definitely have interesting effects and the trip noise on their own turf it's been found to have different medical benefits for example beta carry a queen one of the few non cannabinoids that is no one to actually activate the cb2 receptor it's also known as an anti-inflammatory Plumbing has been shown to be somewhat anti depressant and you have mercy which is the majority are the major constituent of the terpenoids profile in cannabis plants so mersin is shown to also have medical benefits some extent you know the trip lines are very interesting and they give cannabis its uniqueness you know you have one plan that is sixteen percent THC plan you have another type of sixteen percent THC plant but yet they give you somewhat several differences in the effects they have on you and a lot of that can be attributed to the turf noize", "BQxj8gfdfp0": "hey what's up guys alright today we got the hemp bombs review if you don't know this is a CBD eliquid very nice it is alright so I'll just get into the review so all right I'm leaving on the stick prints with the new prints tink works amazing with I love just I just love the look at this thing it's so beautiful okay so um now I've tried many CBDs I've tried cartridges I've tried syrup I've tried dummies capsules tried everything I have to say this is the best CBD that I've ever had it is so it's very flavorful it's uh like I have exotic this is the exotic watermelon cush 200 milligrams teeny very very good I just absolutely love it um now it is for mods which I like because like I don't know man like you know I've cut down from nicotine and all the way down to zero nicotine and I just as I'm tired of vaping that so I was like well they make CBD juice for mod so why the hell not so my experience so far with it um I've been using it for about a week now I get really really bad headaches terrible headaches I have to take ibuprofen almost every day and I have not had to take ibuprofen in a week because I've been I wake up I hit this you know like six seven times and then it kind of just I just I hold it in that's what you're supposed to do you don't this isn't something that you're gonna be you know just blowing big clouds with you want to hold it in for a little bit just so that the CD can get into your you know just affect you more same thing with nicotine you know if you hold it in longer you're gonna get yeah so yeah I've been I've been using it for a week and it's been working good I haven't had any Hanks it takes away my headaches right away I don't really have any pain anywhere so I can't really like say if it's been helping with that well I mean the signs of pain in my head for my headaches but and it hasn't been helping tremendously with that I am beyond happy with that because ibuprofen his bed and it is a my stomach is my stuff from ibuprofen is of how much I was taking it um da I do have to say though so I was hitting it I was on my way to work and I hit it before work you know I was feeling good I was feeling good and all of a sudden it hit me and I will say if you do hit this a lot you are going to get you are gonna get very relaxed because I was I was so relaxed as crazy I felt amazing I really bad anxiety and I have been seeing this help a lot with it um it calms me down just I can't even really explain it it's not you don't get high it's nothing like that um it's nothing like that I do have to say though this company they are they are the best CBD company that I have tried they are absolutely amazing the flavors are [ __ ] incredible I the flavors just oh my god you don't you just have to try you mean to go to your local vape shop or go to their website in some of this stuff because it is [ __ ] incredible so yeah I've been like I said I've been using it for a week I'm just gonna keep using it and I'm also going to be trying out ton of their other products so I can just keep reviewing that because I know they have capsules they have syrup they have they have like rub for like pain like if you had on your arm or something or your back they have I'm not sure I thought I heard they had dark treats or like yeah something with dogs and I would like to see if that works because my dog actually has arthritis and I think it would be pretty amazing to see if that works so yeah I got in my tank right now so let's take a hit flavor is incredible flavor is so good so mid um so one thing I did notice though is when you put this in a mod for this Prince tank anyways I couldn't be different for other tanks I suggest waiting a little bit longer for the coils awake because I waited about 20-30 minutes and I hit it I don't know if maybe just something went wrong with the coil is a bad coil whatever but I do believe CBD juice is already pretty much thicker than like your typical vape juice so I think it's the just the consistence of it is a little bit thicker so I mean you can can't really see yeah I know you can't really tell from on-camera but that's the only thing but the school has been lasting me a good while I'm going through about one and a half tanks of this a day this [ __ ] is [ __ ] amazing I'm telling you you need to go to their website get some I don't care what it is you you get one of their products because it is amazing it's good and you get some pretty decent clogs off of it let's see if we cannot yeah there we go I disappeared for a minute so it's it's good babe juice the vapors very vapors very milky I was in my bedroom and I was just I was just ripping it constantly and I walked out of my bedroom go get some water I came back in I was like holy [ __ ] and it lasted it was hanging around my room for a while even right now though my coil is tasting a little funny I don't think it is I think honestly I got a vape I have a pers tongue really bed if somebody wants to let me know if you got something for vapor stung like something that you guys do to help it because I have it really bad and it gets annoying when I'm doing these reviews yeah so that is the bomb CBD eliquid i hope you guys enjoyed and I hope you go and get some of the stuff because to be honest this is going to be a changer for my life because now I don't have to take medicine for my anxiety I don't have to take medicine for my headaches I'm I am very grateful for this and I do love CBD and I hope you guys can go out and get yourself some I have an amazing day and I will see you next time", "NFWPJiF_9Q8": "once everybody I got a little review today over some CBD that I've recently tried and I'm gonna say it's probably the best CBD I've ever had and I've trust so many CBDs and so many different companies that make CBD and I've tried them all almost and this stuff is probably the best I've ever had it's called liquid gold see we do you know looking stupid but that says milliliters just a 5 mil little 5 mil battle $75 for that but it does not take much at all usually you know there's too many products and different brands you have to use a whole dropper to fool you know they come in different strengths mainly 30 ml bottles up you know 50 milligram 100 milligram 250 mil around 500 milligram 750 1000 whatever all in 30 mil battles and liquid gold thanks there's at a max concentrate I'm not exactly sure on the milligram but instead of it being a Max and a 30 mil bottle it's a max on one of these little bitty bottles so it's very strong stuff and it's a very good definitely worth the money because really it's maybe just a small bottle but you don't use much of it at all I'm actually using a boo boo to with a dead rabbit RDA at sixty seven point five watts point two six on the dual cooled just round wire alright now I'll talk about when you get some alergy software I'm gonna pretty closely and see that and it is pretty thick stuff to just get yellow drop of it take this dropper actually this little dropper just put two I put two drops one oh he's cool that's all I use no I just screw back so this is CBD dis flavors jungle juice but they make jungle juice strawberry and watermelon all max concentrates is either 5 or 12 no bottles and they do even have little single shot 1 no bottles to the 1 mil is $30 a 5 mil is in stores is 75 but I think maybe online it's 89 and the twelve Mills in stores is 115 in online it is $99.99 and diamond CBD which is a another great CBD if you go to diamonds website they have liquid gold on there too mmm and they both come in 5 and 12 mil bottles too but they also have a 16 mil bottle for about the same price and diamonds he is really good I've tried like I said I've tried I mean you've seen these trends and anything as good as this um this is CBD drip this here is your forever strength of 16 micron scooby-dee and they'd ain't no good the fiber is very terrible you know like I said I don't a half of this into tank one time just hit it back to back to back to back you know throw half the tank and it wasn't no good so I just got the tank out and put a new pole in it cuz this stuff tastes awful but this liquid go you can actually add to your tank - and they even it comes in a one that's not flavored at all and it doesn't have no flavor so it won't affect the taste of your juice I'm mixing it with Space Jam it's actually particle X but this bottle says particle law but they said blue-raspberry pretty good these are the boxes that they come in this is the this is the bomb no box of jungle juice it says pop know right down there 18 K liquid gold CBD additive that's the box for it this is the twelve-mile bottle this is the non-flavored this is just regular seaweed ecomax concentrate FDA approved this is it sorry this is the 12 most so you can actually sit in bottle sauce between the 5 of the 12 that's 12 minutes but this is no player actually dropped this bottle and busted the bottom out of it I still saved most of the juice but the bottle itself is no like a real THC how you know it's no THC it was for a number of different things but this is CBD is to see buddy go over it was right for the CBD Dru then ain't no count about wouldn't even suggest buying it if I was gonna spend the money on how I'd go and get the good stuff get the lookbook cuz it really works yes for we know the somnium is I my pain takes like any kind of muscle pain muscle aches it just helps with a number of different things and exhausting where people's starting to use this and serve actually takes from taking their prescription medicines that they use and um he does not show up on piss test so you won't have to worry about filling no drug test or anything smoking this and really this is probably the best you're gonna get for the money because if you were to go on like um koi or or Alpine helping Bob bottle of their say even like 250 milligrams CBD or 500 milligrams CBD they're all gonna come in 30 little bottles so you're gonna thank you know that's a lot more juice so let me just buy that instead of one of these little small bottles cuz that'll last a lot longer well no this far into the case because the 30 min say it's got 500 milligrams there's got 500 milligrams in that whole 30ml bottle so if you using a hoe dropper you know you might be getting what it's ten milligrams maybe you know and something like this isn't max concentrate I thank the max on CBDs is 1000 but I've seen are so I'm not very sure how much is in this I will email the company personally if I can you know figure out the concentrated is how potent it is how many milligrams of CBD but it's the max concentrate CBD in these little PD bottles so it does not take much at all you know like you just saying I just put two little bitty drops on there and that's it that's all I need and um you know it really lasts a long time you know you can I haven't even really touched this bottle at all and you know I make it you know thirty four times a day maybe sometimes just two times sometimes just a night time but I'm gonna be doing a lot of uh CBD reviews I'm gonna be doing a lot of they previews over different mods of tanks cuz I got a bunch of mods and tanks I'm gonna be looking at going over and I have a [ __ ] ton of juice I mean I got bottles and bottles of juice some beginner juice refused to but I'm mainly i'ma try to stick to the CBD and the bait and maybe just do a look which reviews every now and then but I'm definitely gonna stick to doing the very preview and I'll have CBD refuses you know that as soon as I get it in I'm gonna be doing reviews over though sea wheedies cuz I'm still not done trying this is what I'm gonna keep personally for myself and use but imma try some different companies see if I can't find one that I like better but it really makes her real calm and relaxed they don't like just you know a sense of wellness well-being and its really good for for a number of different things and for people that so forth anxiety or you know pain muscle aches and things of that nature I would really suggest trying it ain't giving a shot because you know we all know the pain pills the way the economy and stuffs get nowadays that [ __ ] just ruins your life so I would definitely suggest just to try and give it a shot if you don't like you know you don't like it but how would it leaves give it a shot it's a little pricey but it's it's definitely a good product really definitely works but um this will be my first speaking on youtube so you know why comment you know definitely subscribe um and leave some comments down below some things that you would like to see you know I haven't I've been wanting to get into this for a while and I finally found the right product that I think would be good for y'all because it's just some very good seaweed so yeah highly recommended and thank y'all for watching", "DQEgiUiofks": "so what I got here is plus CBD oil and this hair says it's a hand pump so this is pretty much an ointment that distributes CBD to pain areas in the body so the reason why I got this was my mother has a herniated disc and I'm using discs for her pain management so the symptoms that she has is sort of akin to the very numb feeling in your limbs and also the sort of electrical sort of tingly feeling that you get when you are very numb or that you've sat in one place at a time except it's a lot more painful so this will help in her pain management mainly for her spine in her herniated disc so she will rub this on her limbs or on areas that are very numb sometimes it's in her neck sometimes it's in her trapezoidal area so the main ingredients for this is CBD so what CBD is it is the main active ingredients in marijuana so I'm gonna open up this sort of a hemp bomb here and disappointment and straws show you how it looks so this here is the plus CD brand and the reason why I got this was mainly because it's distributed by CVS so it speaks to the quality and the thoroughness of which they vetted the company so this is destroyed by CV Sciences in so hopefully in in the CVS stores now other areas that people use this for is sort of for relaxation if they are stressed you know they they will use this I've read that they put it sort of on the under sole of their feet and it helps them sleep better and it relaxes them so this is a very natural homeopathic solution to you know some of the pain management and also the stress management so I'm going to open this up and show you exactly what's in it so this does cost $50 for the one point three ounces and this does last a long time some people say it lasts you know 30 days to 90 days so I'm just gonna remove this wrapper here and show you the ointment now the ointment doesn't smell you know it's it's not like tiger balm or any of the other sort of aunt mints that have a very strong smell and you can see here you know what what it sort of looks like so I'm gonna zoom in and give you a better look and give you a little you know so so the texture of it is more or less like Vaseline and it does not smell I mean it has a very very subtle mental smell but it's not strong where it's like tiger balm and it fills the room so just keep that in mind and just going around the bottle here just to give you a better look it is CBD oil and it is the extra-strength version and I will have these links in the description area it is a hundred milligrams of CBD and once again C D stands for cannabidiol which is the active ingredient in marijuana without the psychedelic or the sort of hallucinogenic aspects of marijuana and I mean just go around and you could see the consistency of the bomb here is sort of like Vaseline but it's not as liquidy or as thick if you look right on my finger but there you go that's what I wanted to show and I hope this helps and please subscribe and thank you for watching", "d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and

feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want the best deals for these CBD creams just

In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for watching!", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "3P9Dz3G-nIo": "it's a great day to talk cbd creams and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE TURBULENT YEARS.

FRONTIER.\n>> Jason: AND NOT GOING AWAY.", "fHrMSVTHPMw": "well hello there my name is leanne from healthfulpursuit.com thank you so much for hanging out with me welcome to my channel today we're chatting about cbd i want you to walk away from today's video knowing what cbd oil to say yes to and what cbd oil to say no thanks i do not want that in my life i am not wasting my money there are so many influencers talking about cbd and so today i wanted to share with you a list of things to look for in your cbd so that you are not deceived when it comes to cbd now if you do not know what cbd is or how it works i'm going to include a link down below where you can read an article that i wrote all about cbd oil my husband is on it for general health i'm on it for anxiety so it's good stuff and so i wanted to share with you because so many women okay we spend hundreds of dollars on the cbd product we're really excited we try it for a week it doesn't work what's going on you probably got bamboozled sorry so we're gonna go through a list of things that i look for in a cbd oil and then i'm gonna introduce you to a couple products that i use how i use them and all the things so let's get started okay here's what to look for in a cbd product full spectrum unfiltered so you want a full dropper if you're using the tinctures to have one like one serving should be at minimum 15 milligrams of cbd the website should provide third party lab results and ideally the website should also have a 1 800 number a phone number that you can call to ask them questions customer service is a must it's also great if the cbd is raw or unfiltered now the forms that i find at the quickest are going to be your tinctures salves and lotions the gummies i would just personally avoid they're not going to have enough cbd in there last but certainly not least we want to look for a usda certified organic product and this is really to just confirm that that organic label is actually true a lot of brands unfortunately will say it's organic when it's not actually actually so that's a list that you can use you know go grab your c video i'll pause this video go grab your ceo rewind a little bit and see how many of those boxes did your cbd oil check and if not very many then chances are you're not the problem your cbd oil is and it's time for an upgrade so if you are looking for a different type of product i'm going to show you the three that i well technically it's four that i use how i use them and how you can use them too if you're looking for another brand now if you're looking for another brand and you decide to go with the one that i recommend because it's awesome um you can find no details down below on how you can get some savings on it okay so i'm going to show you first the extra strength tincture okay so this is a dropper and let's see if i can get a full this is one milliliter of cbd okay and in the extra strength that's 50 milligrams of cbd that's a lot generally speaking for sleep anxiety i'll usually start off my clients on 25 milligrams and stay on there for a couple weeks and we might increase it but we usually don't so half a dropper full is more than enough you put it under your tongue you just let it sit for about 30 seconds now there is this lower dose which is what our dog coconut takes and this is a regular strength one full dropper is going to be 17 milligrams so for our dogs how i calculated out doing the research that i did is that um five milligrams of cbd is good for 20 pounds of the dog weighs so coconut or doberman is a 70 pound beast although she thinks she's five pounds um so one full dropper of the 17 milligram is enough so those are the tinctures then we get into the super fun stuff which i'm really excited about the first one is this cbd salve so i like to keep this in my gym bag or like close to where i work out or right before bed i'll put this on targeted areas you can see that it's like it's like a lipstick it's like a lip balm it's like a beeswax type type of um self okay so this product has organic hemp extract infused with arnica birch bark and peppermint essential oil the full spectrum cbd and their super salve works in harmony with natural pain and inflammation reducers such as arnica and birch bark to achieve maximum results third party lab results are displayed online products ingredients include organic coconut oil organic beeswax organic birch bark and arnica infused mct oil organic peppermint essential oil it's great on spot inflammation joint pain arthritis bruising and muscle soreness the great thing about topical cbd oil is that it goes directly to the source when you take it orally it has to bypass through the gi tract before being absorbed then it gets distributed to the areas that need it that are needed in your body when you apply topical cbd directly to where you're feeling discomfort it can be absorbed right through the skin and find the source of the problem quickly think of it like a lasered approach this is best for spot issues and great for anyone living a sporty active lifestyle a powerful topical recovery tool so that is your cbd self then we get into the newest the greatest the ultimate cbd lotion so we have um unscented i was about to say unflavored do you not eat this and then we have the lavender arnica you guys know arnica is really great for pain relief so how you use these cbd oil lotions is different than how you use the cell the cell is more spot treatment the lotions are more for like all over your body usage while the arnica specifically is helpful for pain so how i use these is when i'm getting out of the shower or bath at night i'll just put a little lotion on the places that need hydration but here's the texture so you can kind of see it's lotion you know you just rub it in it's nice and like it's not sticky it absorbs really really quickly it's really nice so the eaton hemp lotion is specifically formulated with ingredients that keep your skin glowing healthy and hydrated use every day for optimal skin hydration it can be used for spot treatment for bruising or soreness it's packed with six times the amount of cbd as the leading competitors their cbe lotion provides a feel-good way to reduce inflammation and aid in muscle recovery on the spot packed with powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents cbd is said to be one of the most powerful nutrients for skin health not only does this product aid in reducing inflammation and providing pain relief in your muscles but daily use will result in visually healthier looking skin that's a little bit about cbd how i use it again cbd oil under the mouth i don't recommend the pills because they take forever to absorb and if you have an issue with digestion you're never going to feel the effects for the self you're going to use it in those spot areas and then for the lotion just everyday hydration for your skin and again remember that list at the beginning of looking for those various things that you want to look for in a cbd oil and do not be deceived there are so many products out there they're very expensive and it's really important that you get the good quality kind so that you can figure out if cbd oil works for you so i hope you've enjoyed this video you can find out more with savings codes and such if you want to grab eaton hemp i'll include all those details down below and and don't forget to subscribe to my channel i come up with videos like every week sort of depends i'm not on a calendar i just make things that inspire me as they come along so i hope you enjoyed today's video and i will see you soonish okay bye", "fejytAIWC_g": "hey I wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "iGcGS66Qk8A": "hey everybody I've just been having some problems - problems fun taking a thumbnail for this video I think I needed some twenty dollar bills to have in flash in one hand I've made lots of money on my CBD bomb I am known all over the county and people send people it's infectious and the CBD bomb is beating cheaper to produce a hundred and eighty-seven farmers Hey a hundred and eighty-seven farmers in Alabama have harvested this year for the first time and in Tennessee they have even more and they're even having a problem because they don't have enough producers to actually produce their hemp into oil within a time period that's reasonable from the point that they harvest and they're trying to figure out what to do how you know can we take it across state lines and then will it be legal because you're supposed to produce to grow it and produce it within your own agricultural department program and so then that means you take it to another state's agricultural program and so they're trying to work this thing out because they got more hemp than they know what to do with so hemp is fixing the bottom but that's a good thing because there's lots of people out there hurting and there's lots of people on fixed incomes that it should not cost them so much to be pain free right so anyway I have held off you know I put my recipe right out there on face on YouTube and YouTube called me a drug addict and a drug pusher and they they took my videos down and anything that had the word hemp even hemp oil soap they took them all down and so I just you know just quit doing it but everybody's like you know they want the recipe so then I said well I'll start doing online classes regarding CBD products and other things and so finally the day has came tomorrow we or the how to make Kimberly CBD famous famous midi bomb and I'm gonna be giving you the recipe tomorrow is the discussion class yes they attacked a lot of channels let me tell you they took down some of the biggest channels they had at everything but in any case now it's risky this video I'll probably have to delete it because I use the words CBD and I don't want to have any trouble with my channel it's just scary you know I have grandkids videos and whenever the haters was attacking my channel they were actually attacking my videos that had my grandchildren in it and calling them names it was horrible but onto the positive we have our tie-dye rays coming up with positive vibes and what we're talking about is if you want to tomorrow is the discussion class and that's where we're going to discuss the recipe hopefully and all the different options you know can I put this in it can I put this in it can I trade this essential oil can can I use this essential oil can I use this additive can I do can I make a cream instead can I do this can I do that how about this I'm gonna go over all of that including the different attitudes that I'm aware of that might be beneficial like arnica oil turmeric oil things of that sort and we're gonna just it's going to be all about getting you ready to make the bomb making sure you understand absolutely everything you need to understand to change the recipe to suit yourself in every possible way and or why everything that's in this recipe is in this recipe of what it does all right and and then how it works and then the next class is the actual make it day class where I will be making it definitely giving you the recipe detailed by detail showing you exactly how to make it so that you can make the big bucks yourself because there are so many people out there hurting and like I have vendors who buy my bomb and if they accidentally run out without ordering they go into hyperventilation mode because customers once a customer uses this you know this is life or death sometimes this is whether I can go to work or not this is whether I can maintain to clean my house or take care of my children I mean that's how severe it can be sometimes in our customers opinion when they come in and we are getting low and we're worried about running out or we haven't got our supply in and we're low and we're fixing to make more and the fear that we will be out and we try never to run out we only did that one time and we don't everyone do that again so so if by chance you would like to invest and get the absolutely how exactly I make it and let me teach you everything about how I put this recipe together why I put it together the way I did and teach you everything I know about this recipe we're doing that and you go to WWE so P kiss is calm if you're a club member you do get the class much cheaper you get all the classes cheaper but you don't have to do that you don't have to be a member you can just be paid the non-member price it is higher but and you'll get to come in and be a part of the class just like everybody else we've created a secret a secret page on Facebook that you can't even find you can even see that thing and unless you have been invited to join it and so whenever you whenever you pay for the class then I get a hold of you I start sending text messages start calling cuz after you pay you go fill out a form and and you just do all this stuff and then boom we get you on Paige and tomorrow at 6 o'clock we start preparing for the class usually it starts about 6:30 but we go ahead you know we try to go ahead and get the video open and put some music on and let people start coming in and then we do the class usually the classes last thing you want from an hour and a half to two hours sometimes longer and we're gonna do discussion class if you're a member that's only fifty bucks and then then on I think it's November 27th we've had a few people wanting us to push it a little bit closer so that they can go ahead and make it for Christmas for their Christmas shows so we're gonna ask folks if they want to finish the class a little sooner for those who were wanting to do that see if that's agreeable but in any case then we're gonna have make it day and if you're a member that's $125 for making day and that's when you absolutely get the recipe and and and I just wanted to make sure you know and then we're going to be doing how to make the cream as well coming up and and so I just you know I just wanted to get out here because my husband's sister passed away and we have just been a little bit incognito you feel notice I haven't been posted on Facebook my husband received like eight days off bereavement pay and so I let him just recoup at the house for a couple of days and then I took him out in the woods in our camper and we just tried to be with nature and and just tried to you know just let him recoup we both do better outside you know and so I haven't been able to really promote the class as I normally would and of course we've got plenty of people on the page so what happens is it's just like this you will go on Facebook and get on the page and then boom there I'll be going pay on a video on the page and and we'll all you sit down at home with your pencil and paper in a convenient spot I can't see you you can only see me but you can comment and ask questions and it's a go live video on Facebook and what's really wonderful about it is if you can't be there when it happens then you can come back and watch it later you get two weeks on the page and dear until the you'll actually be on the page and you won't be taken off until after the second class and then two weeks after it then you'll be taken off but then if you can't afford this right now because it's fixing me Christmas and you want to wait till next month I mean the month after Christmas well then you can come in and we'll have a special deal for a recorded price only it'll probably be just a touch cheaper but you can't ask questions you just have to put it what other people asked so anyway I just want to let everybody know about the class because that's what I get messages on all the time where's that burst the video can you give me the recipe and I've always said well I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class well now I'm doing that class and and now CBD should become much easier to get a hold of and much cheaper to purchase so yes you won't be able to charge maybe just as much as you was for it but you'll be able to purchase it in such quantity that you'll be able to make more and have a better ample sale and be able to sell it you know instead of just being able to afford to make ten jars because of how expensive the isolates are now you'll be able to make 50 jars and and spend possibly the same amount of money on your eye slits and we sell isolates to members we have that for five grams for $90 including your shipping and you might find it cheaper somewhere else but that's we think it's really super cheap and it and our members have been enjoying that we also sell green Rhodes CBD in bulk all of their edibles in their drops and whatnot to members because they will not sell to someone who doesn't have a brick-and-mortar so you can put in an order for the things that you would like to resell at your booths or your places but if you've got a brick-and-mortar you can go get your own account but if you don't you can purchase it through me and I just try to be a blessing to you and so anyway and we're to have a how to make goat's milk soap with CBD in it and then I've promised everybody a more juice with cheaper classes we're gonna do a cheat class it's gonna be like twenty dollars how to make bar number seven how to make bar number nine you know and maybe fifteen dollars on the recorded version well you can't ask questions and so we're gonna have some classes that are only gonna be available to members but they're gonna be very reasonably priced and and everybody's always want to know exactly how to make some of my bars and I'll tell you exactly how to make that bar and then you can go and make that bar exactly like I told you and you can make wonderful money selling that bar and people can give you hugs and kisses and tell you that's the best soap you ever used I keep winning all these things you know people put my soaps in contests all the time and I always seem to win and I never even know about it till afterwards they'll call me you won you won and it's really great then it's some FDA FDA he was at a college and the FDA was doing a competition on a hot process soap and cold process soap and I won the hot process soap side-- plus-- I won overall and I didn't even know I didn't so so I'm telling you it's not me it's the soap it's just great recipes awesome soap recipes with good affordable recipes that you can make and make money and help people that's always fun so anyway if you would be interested you can go to www.hsn.com says w-w-w dot soapy SOA py kisses ki SS es comm and then if you're on your phone there's this little bitty box you with lines in it it's tiny so we decide you click on it and it'll tell you and you can pick classes available and you can see what's available and what we're fixing to do we also have some classes that what happened and they're down at the bottom and if you pay for one of those classes you just get to go right into that class and enjoy it for two weeks you can't ask questions like you can when it's a live class you know you can send me a message and ask for help but you know you can't ask questions like you normally could during the live class but you can still watch the class and learn from the class and I try to always make them nice and affordable and so I have several classes like that that's just waiting for you to take them and and all that good stuff now I have to answer questions hang up okay live chat there we go let me scroll down see if I've had my glasses on and I get some hellos and some I love yous hey April and Ramona Oh Pam hey Pam Elizabeth this stuff worked so well yes it does I had this one lady come in and she was a massage therapist and she said that when she woke up in the mornings that she couldn't even move her hands or her arms or her elbow she couldn't bend them and then in the mornings while she was waiting to try to you know limber up if she barely like thumped her hand on something the pain was so unbearable that she'd followed her knees it hurts so bad but she can rub my balm all the way up her arms and down her fingers and wake up the next morning completely and totally pain-free and go give people massages now that's some good stuff uh-oh I've lost me messages hang on I got to go back that's what I get for being such a talkative person here Denise hey measure oh there's Ramona it does it does so much food for so many people sherry hey Shadid there you go yeah they attacked a lot of channels I it was horrible yes she's making money off of it and I've augmented my recipe since then we've added things to it we've added essential oils to it to make it better and we've added we've changed it since it was originally went out and I think it works even better oh you love my shirt we sell these here at the store you know I'm just terrible pin spendthrift and I just couldn't seem to do it I just couldn't seem to take a shirt off the Shelf that I could sell to somebody gosh I love these shirts I just love these shirts and finally I just gave in and I got me one shirt and then I put in standard I had to have another one but there's this other one I've been eyeballing oh I gotta tell y'all guys a funny story hang on I got to tell you a funny story don't have nothing to do with CBD let me see but I got to make sure I get all of this yes I have augmented the pie the recipe Joanne and many people get that recipe and then they change it to suit them and sometimes they make devastating mistakes that really harms the way it works and it doesn't work as well and so what the discussion class is going to be about is making sure that you understand what each one of those products does for the recipe and why they're important and and also how they work and and then when you want to add something to it you know evaluating that item and of course you're going to be able to just throw things at me that you want to maybe add and then I'll be able to help you with whether it's a good idea or not because I've had people want to add stuff and oh you know they'll message me and stuff and I just think to myself I'm not gonna say a word but I'll tell them no no no don't do that well no no and this is why I don't do that so instead of telling thousands of people one day at a time I'm gonna tell everybody all at one time so that's what these classes are really about because my phone goes off 90 to nothing all the time you know and I don't mind my husband sometimes days but I don't mind because I love people and and everything but it is difficult to to teach a recipe one person at a time on the phone but when you can just have an online class that everybody can just sit down at home open up their device get on their facebook click on the page and sit back with pencil and paper and and and just suck me dry and then ask questions be able to get answers that's the way and do a whole bunch of people at one time and then from now on when somebody asks they want to say this class is above all go to soapy kisses comm class is available and go down to the bottoms and so that way I can hopefully help everybody from now on that way all right let's say oh hey Norway I know that name I'm you I'm not sure I'd say it right I just hate when I can't say names right but hey in Norway yes ok she says I love your soap recipes I have many soaps that I use your recipes and not only do I love them but my customers love them and that's what we need I have people all the time that tell me that ah there you go she had to see me do everything one of my favourite things at CBD coffee it's freaking expensive but I love it for Jennifer that says that CBD doesn't work for her the the main reason that Sydney doesn't D doesn't work for you is if you have been taking pharmaceutical pain medication for years you have built a tolerance up and so that means that you've got to have a large amount of CBD per dose than in your average person and that's usually why CBD doesn't work for someone but I have found that topical CBD is not affected by this resistance issue and so when someone hurts and they get a good quality product and they rub it where it hurts tada it works even when taking it by mouth you know it just seems like nothing works and for those people who have fibromyalgia you rub it from the tip of the hairline all the way to the tip of the spine and I have designed this bomb to go deep in pop that blood vessel and travel up the blood vessel which is feeding the nerves all the way up and that calms all those nerves down and all that fake pain just shuts up I have had people just go can I hug you and I'm like yeah we just have ourselves a great big ol bear hug and I've had people cry on me kiss me everything in the world with fibromyalgia but you just rub back stuff on the spine and then after it pops in you know then it goes up to the brain and it floods the brain with it and it calms all the nerves up their date on - I'm telling you it's wonderful stuff for fibromyalgia and the topical works sometimes when I've only had one person and all the years I've been selling it and all the customers that's walked in my door that's tried it which is absolutely almost everybody because we're constantly like would you like to put some of this you heard anywhere put some of this on put some of this on because it sells it say I've only had one man that said it didn't work for him on the topical out of all those people everybody's went like wow that gave me 80% pain relief or that oh it's completely gone friend of mine hurt himself and he had done quite a bit for me and so I just poked a thing in the mail to him and he sent me a message and he said oh my god complete and total frickin relief he said I just want to give you a hug and I said you're welcome and he said it's like a miracle and I think he had a hip damaged in Iraq and he was going through you know working with the doctors and I don't know what all they were doing with him but he was hurt and bad every step was super painful and then boom he could walk without pain and that's awesomeness and so anyway I know I get on it I love this stuff I know you'd never kept never picked out well you know I have a stronger version which you'll learn all the recipes when it comes to the bond and we find this for some people the stronger milligram lasts longer for them and it cuts their pain where the weaker one doesn't give them a hundred percent pain relief but that one does we call it the Terminator and and we but we do find that if this does a hundred percent of the job putting the extra strong went on there doesn't always do you any good so you commonly spent your money for nothing for the extra one so so anyway so it's a testing thing that's one of the reasons that we make these little one ounce jars we make these little one ounce jars just for that and now another thing I'm going to teach you is I'm going to teach you how to fill out your labels so that you won't have trouble with websites and with advertising your product and how to advertise it you know a lot of people give a lot of problem with CBD so I'm going to be teaching you how I label mine I worked with my wholesalers to find terminologies that was acceptable with the FDA and also would work with advertisers and I'll teach you how to advertise your product even advertise on Facebook how to advertise on different platforms that won't let you advertise we'll be going over that too and how to do your labels so that you'll be legal because that's important too and of course will be teaching sanitary so that you can make a healthy product that will not mold or have bacteria grow in it never think that we'll ever forget that part of it you've got to be sanitary sanitary sanitary and then when you get done with that you got to be extra sanitary so I'll teach you all of that we'll go through it's not just sitting down and saying put this in that and put here and heat this and poke it in there we're gonna start out with how to cleanse our surfaces all right and then how to cleanse everything we're gonna use and all that kind of stuff and the products that we use here we have a restaurant kitchen so we call it our FDA kitchen it's a three sink system with a hand washing on the side and then and we have certain chemical processes that goes in each one of them to make sure that everything's sanitary and then after they come out handling procedures of each item to make sure that we do it right because there is nothing worse than selling somebody something that moles especially if you've shipped it to them or if they don't live in the same city as you are and they expect for you not only to ship that product back to you and pay for it but also ship them a new one I went through it one time when Brambleberry sold me some preservative my opinion was already dead before they sent it to me and if it wasn't that it got killed in shipping because of the heat because they mailed it out right before the weekend and so therefore it's set in a transfer truck on Sunday and and but you know you can't prove anything like that but we just thought that's what we thought it was and we made hundreds of ounces of lotion and within two weeks or four weeks I think it was two weeks though at all well no it's sort of looking weird at two weeks and it started growing black stuff and green stuff no time after that and I had to pay for everything we took it to a show and sold it and we just had a little bit left and then the call started and we had to pay for every jar to come back and that is the only time I have ever had a product to mold ever I have never I've got test jars of batches I made eight years ago they've never been opened except for what I'm looking at him every once in a while and they've never fingers put in them and they're still just as pretty as the day I made them now if I sort of put my hand in there the preserve you probably couldn't hold up on that but for it to be contamination free you know in the jar it's still good after 8 years so so you know cuz preservative I supposed to live seen the ocean for eight years but anyway that's the only time we've ever had anything mold out of all those years and it was like I don't know four or six hundred ounces worth of product it'll in four ounce jars and we had to pay for every one of those jars to be mailed back and then make new find a preservative that was not dead and make new and ship it out and it was you know within the first few years of starting in this business and I'll tell you it was scary it was stressful and it was something I never want to go through again and so we teach people how to not let that happen to you even how to buy your preservative appropriately we're gonna be talking about all this kind of stuff so anyway I just want you to know we're fixing to have CBD bond class and it's interactive on Facebook and if you want to go to Sophie kisses dot-com and become a member then we'll get you on the member of a secret member page and then if you decide to pay for this class we're gonna go ahead and put you on the class it is a hundred and seventy five dollars and then we'll have the two classes and hopefully you will say wow I have learned so much and then you'll take your all of your knowledge and start selling CBD bomb and within a year people will be chasing you down on the side of the road for more because I know they chased me down let me tell you they do they they send people to left and right our business for CBD bomb just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows it's like a monster and we have a hard time keeping up with it sometimes and that's what can happen with you as well because this stuff is a miracle alright got a quick time now that look it's tight on the back alright so I gotta go home I gotta go take care of my husband and tomorrow I'm going to be doing this class you have I need you to pay by lunch if you can tomorrow if you can if you can't you're gonna have to get a hold of me on Facebook and send me a message or text me on my store number which is by the way anybody that pays text me on my store number - five six - seven nine eighty four oh six and you text me and say I just paid and that way I can easily find you get you to fill out the form which is also on the page get your facebook name find you and get you where you need to be and be able to talk to you right away via text or phone call if you don't have the ability to text call me just don't do it in the middle or not please you don't know how many times I get customers that wake up at three o'clock in the morning because they are over the age of 70 and they just think everybody's awake at 3 o'clock in the morning mm-hm and I get text messages I love you Pam I love all of you all right bye don't take any wooden nickels [Music]", "aG7CRdTARLM": "hey everybody thanks for following our channel this is Catherine from French Broad cannabis we're a formulator and manufacturer of CBD and herbal products in Brevard North Carolina today I want to talk to you about something that I am really passionate about and that is CBD selves I use selves every day I would say that they are my favorite CBD product I like them because they work where you put them so whether you just worked out or maybe you're just sore or just anytime you've got something that's targeted maybe like you know just one area that's something you can point to you and touch there's a lot of different kinds of selves on the market I really like some ones that have hello but oil in them the reason for that is that jojoba oil really mimics the skin and the oils in the skin so it passes the skin barrier very well which means that it's a great carrier oil for selves and for CBD which is oil soluble so there's a lot of different stuff on the market you can get stuff that's like hot coals like something you know that kind of cools your skin and then there's ones that are for sensitive skin those are the ones that I like the most there's ones that are just kind of regular selves that hit a larger market maybe if if you don't like hot cold or have sensitive skin you can just go with it selves that you just want to make sure that it doesn't contain any month all if you don't like that hot cold feeling but there's not a lot of research out there to prove or have any real understanding of efficacy of selves that being said the empirical data and the data from folks actually using it like subjective data is huge the selves are one of the best sellers here they're the best sellers and a lot of shops that I and the reason for that is that they work really quickly they're often also combined with other ingredients like arnica oil or camphor and these sorts of things that are also used in herbalism for the same type of stuff that you use a CBD or cannabis cell for so this only creates a more complex and efficacious product so just make sure that when you're using salves you find something that's been tested and you want to find something that's batch traced so something that's got some sort of batch number on the bottom a good company will have a website that you can go to that has full testing panels on their selves so you'll see that it's got heavy metals testing pesticide testing microbial testing that sort of thing microbial testing is very important in salves because a Staphylococcus or ecoli contamination equal I can happen in cannabis and then as far as Staphylococcus you can introduce that during the formulation stage let's say somebody has a cut on their hand or something like that that's the way that Staphylococcus would get into a finished product and it does stick around so if there is contamination with Staphylococcus it's going to stay in the product so you want to make sure that it's been tested for micro because if you put something that's contaminated on an open area or even an area that you know gets caught later or has a little bit of a you know rash enos to it you could infect your your body through a contaminated product you also want to make sure that it has no pesticides or metals that are above the limit set by the EPA and the Food and Safety Administration's that we have so you aren't putting harmful chemicals on your skin like I said something like I solve especially something that's got jojoba oil as a carrier is going to absorb through your skin so just think about your skin as a big organ and you'll be pulling whatever is in the south into your skin you also want to make sure that they're testing for potency and all of this should be batch traceable so you want to make sure that whatever you're getting is what it says it is and has the documentation to prove it because it's very important what selves I'm just going to give you a little peek of what selves look like this is one of the sobs that we make when you put it on you don't need a lot so it's a you know I'm gonna put on just this much here onto my arm when you apply yourself you're gonna want to kind of gently massage the area to rub it in and also to make sure that you're getting good coverage and that you're not um like leaving any chunks on the skin and then also it'll spread further so that amount just spread from here all the way to here so kind of everywhere that you can see this pink flower and blue on my arm um so you want to make sure that it's kind of a thin layer and then I just like to do like a little bit extra you know massaging the area just to make sure that I'm getting good absorption not everyone likes to do this but I like to kind of try to rest the area after I apply itself that way I can make sure that it's getting some good absorption time rather than you know going out and going for a run right afterwards so I like to apply myself in a time that I'm gonna you know have a little bit of rest maybe like a five-minute sit maybe a lunch break or something like that um salves are really convenient because you can just toss a little salt in your purse that's what I do I've also got a bigger jar you know we have bigger jars and often other companies will have bigger jars as well that you can keep by the bed or something like that at home and it's a lot cheaper to have a bigger jar and a smaller jar that you're pulling from the bigger jar into the smaller jar so I like to get one of each to start and then pull from the bigger jar that way I've got like a little container to put in my purse or maybe you have a little contain from you know a sample of some sort but the bigger jars are always gonna have better price points per milligram and per gram of material so using that to your advantage while still being able hot some thing that's cute and convenient to take with you throughout the day can be really good about storage of sobs you want to be careful how you store yourselves when it's too cold you're not gonna have too much of an issue but when it's too hot you're gonna have a big issue you'll start to get melting you might get onto solution where your cells are so separate from itself so you just want to be careful to store yourselves in a location that isn't gonna have big temperature variation and you want to make sure that the solve you're using stays solid at room temperature there's a lot of solves out on the market that aren't solid at room temperature they're almost kind of like creamy I don't like those selves because when I carry them in my purse if there is a natural temperature variation like throughout the day which there always is in my life because I'm in and out and and you know active so those can melt in my purse and create a big mess or mountain in my car or whatever whenever I am going from place to place and leave my purse in my car or something so you just want to be careful about the selves that you've got when you go into a CBD short shop which I believe is the best place to always buy your CBD you want to ask to try it out and they should have like an open sample of the selves that they're selling so that you can see how it applies and and get to know it make sure it doesn't burn your skin I've had plenty of self starts to irritate my skin so you just kind of want to try it out talk to them for a little while you know dilly-dally in the store and just see how it feels you know give it a couple minutes before you purchase that way you're getting to know your product if you're buying online you know that's the best way that you have available to you that's fine I would just start with a smaller amount to make sure that that solves going to work for you before buying a bigger bottle and then purchase the bigger bottle once you know all is good for you because there are a lot of stuff out there is a lot of products out on the market I would also say stay away from anything that's got chemicals in it if you can't pronounce or know the word that's on the ingredient list chances are it's unnatural and that there aren't there isn't a reason for it in your product so you can make a really good CVD solve with no chemicals at all with only natural ingredients so chemicals um companies that are using chemicals and ourselves are putting unnecessary ingredients and a lot of them are purchasing a base like a lotion base or south base from a company and then using that by adding just CBD in it I don't suggest going with those companies first of all that's not like an artisan brand there's not a lot of love in that and secondly there's just no reason for those chemicals so you're you know you're putting things on your skin that you really don't need to be and a natural product in my opinion is always gonna be better for me and just aligns with my morals better and and in with who I support and and what industries I support so if you've got any questions about selves you want to choose a solve you don't know what the best one is or maybe you don't know if a solve is right for you just go ahead and reach out to us we're happy to talk to you about that and you know maybe it's just worth a try like I said if you can point to an issue on your body and say you know that's the problem right here then a solve is probably good for that it's really worth a try people find that anything that's a targeted issue responds really well to a sell when you're using solves you're going to have to reapply it throughout the day it's not going to work as long as like a capsule or something like that um so you are gonna want to have it with you maybe apply like every two hours or something that's what I normally find but for me some days I don't need it at all in some days I need it five times a day on average I used to solve about three times a day one time you know maybe around 11:00 one time around 2:00 and then one time around 5:00 or at that time so to help me sleep and I really liked it for this area the the neck and shoulders just because that area tends to just give me trouble so I like to put it kind of on my back but you can get somebody to help you apply it or just put it wherever you think fit make sure that you're only using salves on external surfaces and don't put it on open areas like cuts or wounds all right give us a reach out to us give us a follow and let me know if you have any questions about selves we've got a great team on board that can answer your questions and is passionate about product and they're happy to answer any questions you have all right see you soon", "qFPNyuv3pbM": "Welcome back to another video this week I wanted to show you guys how to make your own cannabis lotion So it is a two-part process. I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay. Bye", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website Canadian wheat farm calm

past using CBD was illegal along with its cousin THC which as you know some people smoke now CBD can be consumed or it can be used topically and the products that we have here is made for topical use it's packaged specifically from soap supply companies to go into cosmetics it's not for consumption now this is what it looks like when you buy one gram of isolate powder but you can buy it already suspended in shea butter or in an oil like coconut oil if you want to now I find this way easier to measure because I can see just how much I'm putting into my formula for myself these tiny little spoons are meant to measure 0.15 gram of powder and I'm going to show you here that 10 of these heaping spoonfuls divide one gram perfectly so one spoonful it's about one tenth of a gram now it is a little easier to divide it this way because for me it's a real hassle to get my scale to measure such a small weight if you want to be more accurate you can weigh it but I find that this is always the same measurement for me now if you want to learn more about CBD or cannabis you can learn more in my book cannabis cosmetics this is available on Amazon or you can download an instant PDF copy when you become a member at thermo mermaid calm the links are listed below now this book does go into more detail about CBD and you'll get the full recipe that goes along with this demonstration along with 24 of the recipes that include hemp oil homemade soaps shampoos conditioners face masks lotions and a variety of other things so if you're into CBD as a topical treatment you may be interested in learning more now we're gonna get right into the actual body butter and demonstrate this product here are the list of ingredients that are going into this body butter shea butter you can use mango if you're allergic to Shea cocoa butter hemp oil coconut oil argan oil goat's milk arrowroot and of course our CBD crystalline powder putting this recipe together is not even slightly complicated I'm going to add all the oils into my kitchen mixer now the hard Orioles will stay hard except for the cocoa butter and typically I'll start with the shea butter and give it a little time to break down in the bowl before I start adding in the rest the mixer you see here is set on the slowest setting now once the shea butter starts to soften up I'll gradually add in the other oils and then just let the mixer do all the work even if it looks like it's not doing anything the only thing that you may need to do is loosen the shea away from the beater every few minutes but as the liquid oils melt the shea it'll start to turn into a sloppy soup as this happens just give the mixer time to get everything blended together now if you have spent any time browsing through the other recipes listed over in the members directory at thermal mermaid you may have noticed that I label some body butters winter butters and some of them summer butters but they have almost the exact same texture in the finished product well it's not the thickness that makes me classify whether a body butter is a winter or summer formula this is just by the way arbitrary it's just how I feel about it but when I do this it's based on how my skin feels after its applied now this combination of ingredients has a light slick feel that melts instantly on contact with your skin now as soon as it's applied after just a few seconds your skin feels matte and dry it doesn't leave any build-up or any waxy layer behind and this is really nice for a warm or even hot weather it won't leave your skin dewy and sweaty feeling now part of the light matte texture is in the goat's milk which is rich in caprylic acid lactic acid and also alpha hydroxy acid and of course this also eats up the dead skin cells leaving the surface of your skin feeling fresh and new so even some of these small subtle changes to your base recipe can give you a twist on how to use the product or whether it will feel like when it's finished now at this point we have our mixer running for about the last five minutes and we're just gonna let this work for another few minutes before we introduce the dry ingredients I want all of the oils to be as uniform as possible before we add the rest now if you're an avid lotion maker you'll notice I'm not adding a preservative to this particular batch and that's because what you're watching me make this is just a gift for a friend who's gonna be graduating from Wellesley this week and I'll be going up to give this to her in person so I'm not gonna be selling this now although this product does not have any water in it and it will be perfectly fine for several months without a preservative I always put a preservative in anything that goes out for retail and I recommend that so you may notice that the preservative is listed in the printable recipe over on the website but we're not adding it in right here in this demonstration and in goes the goat's milk and the arrowroot and of course you can use corn starch if you don't put in the arrowroot those two are interchangeable and as soon as this is all blended in you'll start to notice that the butter starts looking fluffier and creaming and so we'll just give these two powders a moment to do their job while we continue mixing next we'll get the CBD powder blended in now this batch that I have right here will make four jars at about sixty grams each and each package I want a hundred milligrams of powder so the entire batch is going to get four scoops in order for me to get that 400 milligrams and of course this is a gift so here's my fourth scoop and put one extra scoop in just for my friend now our fragrance that we're adding today is a beautiful combination of cedar wood and cinnamon and you can make make this a novelty item if you want to you can pull it cannabis flower fragrance oil in there and it smells just like it and what happens is is that younger people love the surprise of something scented cannabis they're picking it up at your market tables it does draw a lot of attention but in my experience my adult friends don't want to walk around smelling like cannabis and so I find that cedar wood and cinnamon it still has that edgy musk aroma and then you add the candy spice and it really is a really pretty combination but it won't get any rumors started at work so this is the one that I choose to put in once all the ingredients are incorporated I have the mixer turned on to the highest setting and now we just let it whip with air now the volume will immediately begin to expand it becomes fluffy we have these nice firm peaks and the texture of the oils start to become something like a wedding cake sugar icing and we all get the texture that we won after we let this whip for about three minutes and then we shut it all down now at this point our body butter is almost done we only have a few more steps to give it a unique look that will make it stand out from other butters with other fragrances you can get a nice close look at how fluffy and smooth the oils have become here once you have all the air whips to this texture this won't deflate it will stay fluffy like this as long as you keep your product at room temperature remember coconut oil becomes a liquid at 76 degrees and you do have coconut oil in here so you have to keep this below 70 degrees because as soon as one oil melts it all starts to separate and it might even encourage the rest of it to melt so you have to keep everything in a neutral temperature and this will stay and remain stable the two colorants that I'm using for this recipe are angry rose and so very green and this will give me a cinnamon and a hemp themed color each part only gets 1/8 of a teaspoon and this is just meant to tint the butter not color it I'm not real big on bright colors in my lotions because this is again it's it's a cosmetic grade mica which means it's also a shadow so you don't want the color to transfer on to your skin so a nice light tint will do the job okay if you caught my last episode which was a short webinar I told you that I will be giving registered members a place on my server and a website at their MoMA made to have their own e-commerce shopping cart now this is set up very similar to Etsy so you can sell your products online the only difference is you don't have any listing fees and there's actually no fee there's no charge at all it's it's perfectly free so if you're just starting out this might be a good opportunity to get into selling your recipes now the first five people have already been chosen from the comments and I'll be announcing the winners tomorrow in my next video so make sure to tune in tomorrow so that you can see if you happen to be one of those winners and this is going to be available to all members so if you are hearing about this for the first time now and you're still interested in signing up or you're interested in learning on how to get a free e-commerce shopping cart no one is going to be left out if this interests you so make sure that you do hit the subscribe button and hit the little bell so you get the notifications so you can find out if you're a winner tomorrow and you have to be registered at with your account at thermo mermaid Calm it's four siren and mermaid level registrations now what will be what we'll be doing after I post some of these beginner tutorials to get people started with their shopping cart is we'll be discussing how to integrate your sales to the people that you meet in the real world online and if you want to follow with these conversations and watch these tutorials then make sure you're subscribed to now piping the butter into the jar is probably the most fun part of this project now you don't have to pipe this if you don't want to it might be a little bit too much effort but this is how you get that to tone to swirl into the jar now when you're doing this for real meaning if you're making a retail product just set the jar on the scale and then pipe up to sixty grams and it'll just fill the jar right to the surface and you might need to tap it down a little bit if you can but I'm over filling these so you can get a good look at how the colors blend and you can see the texture as it's being filled I'm exaggerating these Peaks a little bit just for the photos but the cream will stay in this shape and once you've put it all into the jar now remember this is not a lotion to use this you only take just a pea-sized amount and then you rub that into the surface of your skin to get a lot of coverage if you end up using too much it'll feel like you just poured a teaspoon of oil into your hand when you touch the butter and then you slide it across your skin it melts on contact so this product is very condensed if you're gonna turn this recipe into a lightweight lotion we would end up filling 12 to 16 ounce jars not just this 60 grams that we're putting into these four ounce jars so just keep that in mind when you use it but also keep that in mind when you're selling it and you're pricing it because this is a much much more expensive product than your standard lotions that you would be making so now we have our finished product and let's get one last close-up of just how fluffy and stable this frosting is now let's take a quick look at how it absorbs into my skin I'm going to take just a tiny bit and then rub this into the back of my hand and as you can see it absorbs almost instantly and it doesn't leave anything behind the hemp oil and the goat's milk leave my hand feeling conditioned but no heavy layer and here's our finished product of the New England summer body butter infused with CBD and hemp oil I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and until tomorrow happy creating [Music] [Music]", "Knfl49kyAOQ": "hi it's Matt at Ruth's house studios and welcome to counter basics today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if

back to my channel or welcome if you were new here I would love if you hit that red subscribe button down below and join the positive pack also while you're down there I would love to give this video a huge thumbs up that would really mean a lot to me and as you can tell by the title and thumbnail of this video I tried medical marijuana for my chronic pain and I am pleasantly surprised. I know this is a very very controversial subject Whether it's legal illegal. Whether it should be or shouldn't be whether it should be only used for medical purposes Recreational I know the gist and I just I I everyone has an opinion And I would love if you guys just kept your opinions to yourself I wanted to try something new and natural for me because I'm not the one to take pain pills when I was approached about trying some CBD oil I Jumped right on board I am so excited to be working with CBD bio natural CBD oil They sent me some CBD oil to try and see what I liked what I didn't like if it will work for me If I'm gonna continue using it and so I'm gonna be reviewing This little guy if you don't know what CBD oil it is the non THC It's the oil that doesn't give you a high. There's no THC in some of them some of them Do have low doses of THC this one on the other hand does not it is vegan gluten free all-natural No THC made in America. This is an oil that has no THC, which I didn't I don't care I don't I've never tried CBD oil before this this brand is 250 milligrams CBD drops hemp extract in MCT oil this brand recommends you take a dropper full or two Once or twice a day depending on how much you need it when I started using this I started at half a dropper Just because I didn't know how my body was gonna react, and I wanted to start out a smaller dose Just just to get the feel of it so I started with half a dropper it helped a little bit and so the next time I upped it to a dropper and I tried to keep it around there there were some days that I did do it two droppers at a time and When you only have a small bottle like this It roughly only lasts about a week, and this brand is about 38 dollars a bottle Which can be kind of spendy but for an all-natural product I can understand but If I continue using this brand I would have to probably buy a bottle a week which can get kind of hefty There are so many benefits to CBD oil And I will have them all in a blog post for you guys. You can click a link down in my description I have this all mapped out for you guys In my blog I don't have to just go into so much detail here in my video the taste of this brand Stuff they don't put any extra flavoring they keep it all natural so it does have a bitter taste Which for me I I couldn't handle it. I could not take it without a chaser It was I couldn't do it, No so if I do continue using this I don't I don't know that that's a big factor for me because If I'm like at a store, and I don't have a drink, but I want it or need it That could be an issue for me. Just because I couldn't it would make me gag It's just it's one of those things But it does it's natural, and it's just a hemp oil you can taste the bitterness of it I do recommend CBD oil I'm not a doctor I can't tell you that it's magical and it will work for everyone and da da da da da, but for me I will be continuing using it I did see many positive things From using it, and I didn't suffer any side effects which was awesome like I said this brand has no THC I did not feel high. This is just 100% for pain, and I absolutely love that I think that brand is 100% awesome I will have a link to their website down in the description section But the only downside is the taste and I couldn't do it also I do believe if I wanted to buy more I would find a company or See if they have like a higher dose because when you research CBD oil a lot of the companies are like Take 5 to 10 drops and Here I am taking one to two dropper filled things, and so it's not a very high dose which I think Personally I do need but if you have low pain I think this is 100% perfect. You can buy it online it's legal in all 50 states. There's no THC You will not get high None that jazz and I honestly think that every person should try it if they have chronic pain like I said, I'm not a doctor You don't have to try it. I don't care everyone has an opinion on this I know it's super controversial, but it works for me and I was pleasantly surprised, so I will be continuing to use CBD oil if I use this brand. I don't know We'll see. I don't know I know there are a bunch of other ways you can use CBD oil I know there is CBD flowers. I know you can vape CBD. I know that there's other oils There's other brands with flavored oils. I know that there are bath bombs and bath salts and bath scrubs and lotions and CBD infused Pretty much everything else And I'm really excited to try some of those products like the bath salts and the bath bombs and see if those maybe help with My aches and pains, but like I said Medical marijuana did work for me. I am excited to see what else I can learn from using it I would love to know if you use CBD oil if so what brand what's your favorite? Do you vape it do you use oils you smoke it?

"[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody and welcome back to York River cannabis and today's video I'm going to be doing a very much requested video from all of our subscribers which is how to make extra-strength CBD oil but before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please consider hitting that subscribe button and supporting our channel also if you already have subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks the number one request I've gotten and it's our second most viewed video on our channel is how to make CBD oil but a lot of people want to know how they can get more bang for their buck and how they can get more CBD in that oil and today I'm going to show you how you can do it but before we get into the details of how to make this exercise CBD oil if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and email me I'll leave all that in the description below check out our website we have a new menu all new prices and a lot of our customers make CBD oil at home so we've adjusted a lot of our pricing to accommodate people who make their own CBD oil so go ahead and check that out and you can always email me and we accept most major payments at this point via PayPal folks the ingredients really is just one extra step to make extra strength CBD oil now this is a request for a family member this is not how I make CBD oil here on the farm to distribute so this is just as order for a family friend but I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you how you can do it at home so first thing you're gonna need to do is of course you're gonna want to have your hemp flour now again guys you can always grab this from us and again all that information is in the description below but here is some cherry wine hemp flour that our our family friend requested and we are going to make CBD oil with it now our cherry wine has a great amount of CBD in 19% to be exact so we can get more for our money by adding one simple ingredient and that is lesson 10 now with lesson 10 why does it make so much of a difference well MCT oil has a maximum absorption rate which means even a 100% ratio it really can't absorb all the CBD that these flowers have so to bump up the absorption rate you can add less ATIP and less if it has all the essential things to be able to absorb more cannabinoids so that is why a lot of people adolescent in now there is a ton of different less attends out there there's soy lecithin with granular and liquid you got sunflower lesson 10 grandeur and liquid love about capsules but I just buy liquid now I buy sunflower less attendant that is in the liquid form because I don't like soy I'm not a big fan of eating soy I think it's just in too many foods in the United States today so I went with sunflower lesson you can go with regular if that's what you prefer when you filter it out using our magic butter machine it doesn't really make much of a difference I just prefer the liquid now in order to get this started we're gonna have to decarbonise if allah grants stay the same for our CBD well as it does for this we're going to be doing 28 grams of CBD flour and 2 cups of MCT oil so that's approximately 14 grams of flour per cup now you can range that between seven and fourteen depending on your potency but we're really trying to maximize the absorption rate of the oil and the less intense so we're gonna do the maximum amount and we're going to be adding less aten so I'm going to go D carb our cherry wine flour that we have here I'm going to weigh it to 28 grams we've got our D carboxy R and you can see I've already waited and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the oven I'm going to put it at 250 degrees and I'm going to be doing it for approximately 30 minutes so I will see you in 30 minutes with some D carb flour okay folks our flour has now been D carb is out of the oven and it is ready to go so obviously the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and get all this flour into the magic butter machine now you all know that I absolutely love my magic butter machine you can't convert this recipe to work in a crock-pot or anything else but as always I just want my magic butter machine so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add our MCT oil now this was purchased online 16 fluid ounces I know a lot of my subscribers always ask me what is my favorite MCT oh oh whoa this has pretty much everything you want to look for it's organic non-gmo and of course it's USDA certified organic which is a big deal so first and foremost we're just going to take the wrapper off of this and go ahead and add it now again like I said 16 fluid ounces equals two cups so there's no need to measure this we can go ahead and add it directly into the machine now here's the change of the recipe folks it really depends on how much less attend you want to add I wouldn't go any more than two tablespoons per cup so a maximum for this recipe would be four tablespoons of less eaten but I'm gonna do right in the middle there I'm gonna probably do about three for this recipe because it's such a high CBD amount that I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to under do it so go ahead and get your tablespoon measure and you're just going to measure it out now you can see it's very sludgy so it takes a little bit of time it's almost like molasses type texture it's very slow very syrupy so you're gonna have to take your time with it but maybe we'll just do two for this round two for videos sake but you can add whatever you want so as we wait for this to go into the magic butter machine go ahead and cap everything now here's the thing for for you folks at home here's a little trick to the trade keep your MCT oil bottle because a lot of them come with spouts like this one and what I like to do especially for family members isn't the first time I've done this for family members is I usually just refill the bottle with the CBD oil and hand it back to him and you can do that at home and that way you don't have to use a mason jar or anything like that you can just you know even put another label over top of this I use a sharpie so you know that it's cbdo so you don't try cooking with it or anything like that so most of the lesson2 is off but what we're going to do is we're going to use our trusty magic butter spatula and make sure we get it all off of the tablespoon here and you go ahead and see so that's about it best we can now now that we've added the Blessington we're gonna go ahead and fire up our magic butter machine so let me get this plugged in now folks as always same as before we're gonna go up to 160 which is the middle of the road for this so there's your temperature 160 and I do 4 hours for the texture so folks I will see you in four hours to show you the final product all right folks so this has just gone off the magic butter machines timer has gone off so I'm going to do is go ahead and unplug it and you know go ahead and get all the stuff you can off the top of the machine here this one looks pretty good right now actually now the whole lot to get off of there which is good I find that the little spatula that magic butter makes works really well for this now we got their spatula kit from the a couple weeks ago all right so now as always guys you see how it's always on the edge here so you just want to scoop that down in because that has oil in it get all that ends all right and so this process is going to be the same as we've always done with all of our other oils you always put it on the love glove or the the silicone glove you always put it on your dominant hand if your left hand and put it on your left hand it just makes things easier okay so that is the majority of the oil right there now this oil will definitely be darker than a traditional CBD whoa and that is because of the sunflower lecithin note no worries about it it doesn't really have much of a different flavor but it's just something to note if you are using the liquid less inton it will have a darker look to it and I'll show you here so you can see it's a little darker than normal CBD oil not by much but it's definitely noticeable a lot of times when I make it with the by ox you know it comes out a little bit lighter and so typically what I'll do is I'll get all the other stuff there's still plant material that needs to be squeezed but I want to show you guys this trick I go ahead and I put it right back in the bottle okay so what this does to is it frees up this Pyrex measuring cup for me to be able to get all the plant material really not have to worry about splashing any of the oil or wasting any of the oil so you go ahead and you just put it right back in the bottle and then go ahead and put all the plant material in here and get rid of it so now you're not going to get a lot of oil out of the plants but it is worth giving a good squeeze you know making sure it's all out of there get as much as you can again you don't want to waste it it's good stuff takes four hours to make so you want to make sure that you get your money's worth if you're at home looks pretty good one more scoop here all right so that's it get your uh your glove back on and you kind of shake it all down there you're just gonna give it a good squeeze try to get as much of that well as you can out of there now you can refine it a little bit more if you want I have Magic butters other screens the 190th which is what they provide with the magic butter machine works great but if you don't like any type of sediment or plant material in your oil you can't even refine it more but I recommend making sure you do this round first and then go ahead and use a different screen but yeah so we can add that we need to get a lot out of the plant material but it's enough I would say that we got a pretty decent return probably about 13 ounces out of the 16 you're always gonna lose oil so that's just the nature and there's still some in here but that's what I have for you today guys again remember if you need hemp flour my contact information will be in the description below go ahead and check it out we have adjust our prices for people who make their own CBD oil at home to benefit

love the effect of the product so again this is our number one selling topical our CBD salve [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "fw_X5w1mMso": "[Music] yo what is going on everybody it's your boy joseph the realest and today i got a review uh well i got this free it's called the company's called tennessee i believe um it says patent pending so this is a 150 milligram um cbd hemp extract full spectrum salve um so this is a topical application five milligrams uh since five milligrams per use i guess 30 applications in a jar allows three minutes to longer before wiping hands so yeah this is i never really used any type of i use like a lotion that's supposed to help with the muscles and stuff like that so i didn't really know too much about this i asked the owner or whoever was the instagram uh about this product oh no actually before sorry let me tell you all the box real quick i didn't get to show you the box so this is the front oh actually now this is the front so yeah this is the product right here you don't want to pause and read that i can go ahead and do that and uh i guess this is the well they like it's a food or something um but yeah so it has this is uh one ounce so it says it's cbda and regular cbd and 100 yeah has 150 grams so this is the jar right here that it comes in so yeah i'm gonna open this up oh [ __ ] i forgot so yeah this is the the cream right here or topical uh i don't know what to call it really like i never use anything like this but you know what i just came back from vacation and i was working out and swimming and stuff like that and um i was having like a really bad pain on my leg i don't know if i pulled a muscle or something i'm not sure exactly like what it was like it was in pain where like every time i stretch i'm putting some on my leg right now um no it feels a little better from yesterday but it still has a little bit of you know a little bit of like every time i stretch out or you know stand up whatever he has a little pain um you know like i feel like i stretch the muscle or something i don't know too much about all that whatever but i really wanted to try out this i also want to give it to my mom because she has some like her muscles hurt i heard this like helps out with like pain um you put it straight on to whatever area that like you have um issues with kind of like you do with icy hot um but the cbd you know you have a back pain whatever like your muscles right here um but uh yeah i guess my first time actually using this type of a cream what do they want to call it a salve that's the main thing what it's called a salve never like i said i think i've heard some stuff about it never used it never really thought about buying it but um like i said it might be like icy hot don't quote me on that but um you know when you have like muscles and you put that on your skin this other company cbdology had something where you put you put like it's like a lotion and or cream and you put it on your area and it has like a little bit of menthol kind of like i guess it mimics like icy hot so it was my first time trying this i put on some and you do feel like a not like i see how but it feels like like a like a cool you know your my leg feels like cooler like it has like like a cool sensation like almost not like a man but like feels just i don't even know how to explain it whatever it just feels like a cooler feeling on my leg um yeah i'm definitely gonna like give this to my mom because she has back issues she got into an injury with her back and i gave that other criminal how much said it worked all right so this one seems like it's more um it has a little more cbd and um hopefully it works for her um on my leg right here i'm gonna let it sit in for a little bit so i can make it see if it does anything um let me see if it has a smell doesn't really have a smell it just smells like uh like a very light sense of like lotion type of smell and i rub it into my muscle right here because i did have some issues with my left upper leg so i'm hoping that it helps out um i know it's not going to cure and cure anything you know cbd you can't really um say that it cures or you know because it's not fda approved yet but um hopefully they do some research on the cbd um all the different you know benefits that it has whatever like because i don't see why not whatever like it's legal now so might as well study it and you know get the best out of it but um so far my leg it feels a little bit better like honestly like it really my leg was bothering me a lot or like i i really didn't want to feel like doing these reviews because my my leg was in pain um like i said it was worse yesterday but um hopefully this cream will relax my muscle and hopefully it gets better or unless it feels better um but yeah um definitely i'll leave the links down below for their instagram and their website so you have to try them out guys because definitely um i got this for free so you know i'm not sure if how many they gave away for free or if you could try it out or what but make sure to go check out their website or their instagram and they'll give you some details on that um yeah i definitely i i would i would want to recommend this whatever it seems like it's a legit company the product seems like it's uh very well made i like i like the jar that it comes in it really feels like a little icy hot type of feeling to it um but it you don't get that hot but you definitely get that cool but it doesn't feel like a man it just feels like it's just cool like i don't know but it feels good though i like it um but anyways guys i hope you enjoyed the video um i just want to do a quick review on this item that i got and um i was excited and uh curious to see like what it does and if i could recommend it to people and at first i was

marijuana continue to unfold and for one little boy with a rare skin disorder it's been a near miracle well as 13 first reported last May his family was really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no scarring no sign that there was ever even any buildup there at all a dermatologist told them there is nothing on the market that I could prescribe you that would give you better results than what you're getting so how does it work dr. Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we can well we can do since our first report Carter story has gone international we have a lot more about his journey on ktnv calm Darcy Spears 13 Action News Carter wandering the district I'm", "x_h4UQuhjbk": "UNEXPLAINED SCIENCE THERE.

our pumpkin dinner roll video yeah yes and today I'm really excited because we were gonna make cannabis cell so we have one cup of cannabis coconut oil and we have one cup of cocoa butter you could also use shea butter if you wanted to we're a no butter or mango butter and here k has shaved off of this block of beeswax with one cup of beeswax and we're gonna use two tablespoons of jojoba oil and we have these were my three essential oils but then k fried this entire box of essential oils that's a partial partial sometimes like the room to smell good I have a double boiler set up here it's just a saucepan with about an inch of water and it's simmering and then I have a glass bowl place on top and we're gonna melt all of our ingredients together how easy is that why don't you go ahead and pour in that beeswax and then we're adding cocoa butter and then our cannabis coconut oil I've already melted it because it's easier to measure out when it's melted and yes our two tablespoons of jojoba can I just have a silicon spatula I am going to use to mix this all together while it melts easy peasy lemon squeezy so when we're done with this you can put this you can make it into a lotion bar but by putting it in like a cupcake liner I've also saved this little lotion container that you forgot a jar yeah you can put it in a little jar or I actually even saved a chapstick container pour it in the chest and let it cool could wear this also as trap stick so I also brought a measuring cup with a spout so we can use it to pour into my chopstick containers you can also buy these a craft store you could also I clean out an old deodorant container and use that oh yeah you can pour it into the container and let it harden we're almost completely melted so I'm just going to twist it all the way back down and then you can just pour it in there to fill it up isn't that the coolest thing and it you've never heard of I mean one of but the coolest thing and I've set up all of our little containers we have two chopstick containers that I saved from Jeffster and we have some heart-shaped don't mind the heart shapes silicone mold okay so I'm gonna use this to grip the chopstick and then pour are you ready I'm so nervous I just like knock it over okay it's not as bad as I thought it would oh now just leave don't touch it so don't touch it we have to let all these things harden no I'm scared though give it you can do it move over okay give you space okay goodies baby space I'm gonna I'm gonna be the one who spills it it wasn't that bad I just rested it on yeah why is that nerve-racking I was like having anxiety I know it's really because it's such a small little container I kinda it's really so if I had joint pain maybe all my joint pain would be gone but I don't have any joint pain but this feels super nice no it's is no moisturizing and nice mmm smells like chocolate which is bad because it's gonna make me wanna cave chocolate I'm gonna put but some spearmint this is such a quick and easy video you just let it cool at room temperature just let it cool it out yeah just chill Wow quick and easy you saw how fast and easy this was to make our own camp South at home if you were to use regular coconut oil instead of cannabis coconut oil you could just use these as regular lotion bars we also have chopsticks so we can use this chopstick and it's great for if you have joint pain or if you have a bad knee it'll really soothe an easier pains but thank you guys for tuning in to our quick little tutorial on how to make your own canvas style thank you my friend kay we're coming to you knocked huh we're coming to join me and thanks again I'll see you guys next week it's good hang the I see I bye [Music]", "x1vI0t4GgsE": "so Jami is going to make homemade him sad this is one pound so I melt beeswax coconut oil aloe vera okay right okay so we added a whole package of wax which is about yet and a half pound okay so we do four parts coconut four part temp usually but I go a little bit more than him and we should do an equal amount of aloe vera so this is a 16 ounces and there's so we'll use about less than half of that all right we'll add that in right after we do the coconut then we're going to turn the heat off your skin when it starts to develop a little bit of a skin on it and look for the hemp oil in there mix it up real good then we let it settle down and then right after that I guess well I've never had I've always added the vanilla beads but we'll just add the vanilla oil skew drops maybe even let's drop it around and it'll smell good yeah watch so we used a half pound with beeswax we're gonna use two pounds of because [Music] unless so you like to seeing what you make your M Sava I guess there is coconut on that something was in we try to get a couple bite game what which drive-by and I'm the villain I'll be like is the rendition of seven gold and the Visigoths [Music] how long did let that go this for hotel becomes clear clear what can't do it [Music] yeah so we're either a mercy wait [Music] that's a libero there was a liquid when he mixed it into the hot wax and it does do a solid welcome Kim the in there has to be coming back has become heterogeneous a stateless release its bonding and make you want and that tear we almost qualifies for medicine man but it all together as a loader no it was all the heat it breaks down form to you but it shocked Misha Lee to explain how can I does the same thing separates not a liquid when you pour it in as a liquid at guitar now what we'll do is we'll turn this off then when it starts to develop the skin will put the hemp oil in then we'll add the vanilla variant [Music] four parts in oil hipsters make this ad you'll have to give me a recipe Jeremy okay he's our Peduto my jaw she can still do that I'll give you the oil and then you put the vanilla no it's one part beeswax which goes in first one part beeps what then four parts coconut which goes in second and you wait for it to become homogeneous one part or a little bit more aloe vera and they'd add that after the coconut and again you got to wait for it to become homogeneous and you let it cool down develop that skin and you put four types ham little more if you want and thin yes that's right and then I use it and I become homogeneous I use it in Munster almost kind of proven hair sucker you homeboy idea radius militia mark guy who's gay gay gay this is Ruben lol [ __ ] what he said it's probably mess under shoot from the hip that's just purely for the system yeah well the know has you know people like the vanilla scent on energy pleasant for a man or alone yeah and there's good for you you don't add it what does it smell like just nothing there's coconut oh yeah don't get a big smell out of it it's really gonna be what I'm real definitely add it you can add anything up so where do you purchase this coconut oil and refined I got that off the internet on at the bread route and get a staple and spice you get up in probably good non organic coconut oil at I did it health record Google this is here yeah okay so the part doesn't know there's some part ears as long as they're all equal parts I mean do you use the same measurement part yeah whatever whatever you happen to do so I use I used to have a pound of beeswax approximately so I want to use two pounds of fat that's approximately two months all right here baby cheese type stuff and say just different stuff that's not liquid how many boards over one part or mark depending on what you want and then you add hemp oil once it's cooled down to the point where it develops skin so that's for putter Templar then you can add other essential oils at that time you could also add vitamin E at that time add vitamin E once it's cooled down to him and I will put this in the freezer and we'll let it yeah if you want that's just another idea or any kind of essential oils that you think are good for you by virgin olive oil or the label like some people have certain affiliations for where I use vanilla just because it's it works for both genders and everybody likes signals alright gender friendly amount for parts coconut let it become homogenous one part or more LOV rapid fridge to develop a skin or parts hemp oil add vitamin E or any essential oil right need to stir it to mix it all up and put in the fridge and let it become thick that's what it mr. James who makes my Mineola which opinion I would you don't need a ton of vitamin E usually when things have I mean we've been boiling the string about two hours we're going to rinse it out and I'll take it out maybe we've boiled a lot of the lignin out now we're going to rinse the lignin off it and then we're going to boil it for two more hours to get more the lignin out of it okay and then

have it treating sports injuries chronic back pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "xAW6oB6E4fQ": "hey everyone I'm Shireen kasam the founder of my pain center calm the number one CVD resource for you to try and buy CBD okay what I want to talk to you about today is I get a lot of questions Shireen there's so many different CBD balms and muscle relaxants or muscle lotions out there which one should I get and that is true there are so many different types of CD CBD bombs out there that you have to make sure you pick the right one because you could spend 30 50 60 dollars on something that's not gonna work for you so how do you know what's the right one well one do your research and you can research all the products at my pain center calm we kind of break down what to look for in a product and what are the top things that our products have to check how much CBD is in the bottle and what's the size of the bottle so let's we're gonna get into that in a minute and then third just make sure that the the product has a certificate of analysis make sure that it's the correct amount of CBD that they're selling to you make sure it's not fake you know like a lot of people can now just put CBD stickers on their products so make sure you're buying your product from a reliable source such as my pain center calm we've spent over ten thousand dollars trying CBD products to make sure that we sell products to you that we really believe in that we actually use so like my mom has arthritis I have sciatica my dad has a torn rotator cuff as well as herniated discs my boyfriend is a firefighter so he's always sore and in pain and so we've only used we are only suggesting products to you that we truly truly believe in one of our favorite products is this green rose product is a muscle and joint and relief cream now here's what I was talking about about size okay this is a 1 ounce jar this whole thing is 1 ounce and there's a hundred and 15 milligrams of CBD in it that means the whole thing has 150 milligrams of CBD not every time you use it is it 150 milligrams of CBD so when I say it's a hundred and fifty milligrams per 1 ounce that is the same thing as somebody saying this jar has 300 milligrams in it and it's 2 ounces or this jar has 450 milligrams in it but it's three ounces do you see how it's all the same so technically only the price should be going up somebody shouldn't say to you that the the jar with 300 milligrams that's 2 ounces is any stronger than this one because it's kind of it's the concentration like it's all about the concentration so this one is actually one of my favorite products my mom uses this one for her arthritis on her hands I will use this on my sciatica it's a really cool application it's just a pump so it's it's clean it's easy to use and just pump it on there another one of my favorite products is this one which is a green roach product as well it's a muscle and joint but it's got heat relief in it now this one is two hundred and fifty milligrams for three ounces so it's a little bit less CBD than this one but here are the pros about this one this one I love especially at night this is one of my go-to that night because usually like I've brushed my teeth like I've showered I'm in bed I'm ready to go to bed and then my leg starts to hurt right the flare-ups start to happen either because you're laying down on your herniated disc or now your brain is kind of it's not worried about the day-to-day things you're doing so now your brain has time to focus on the pain so what I love about this one is it's a roll-on like literally it's just a roll-on and the great thing about that is you don't have to rub it and you can if you want to but you don't have to rub it in and it's got the heat relief so if you live in if you like that that feeling of like it's working for you it's great but I love it because I can just roll it on me and go to sleep like I don't have to get back out of bed to wash my hands so I love this product this one is my favorite personally because again I don't have to dirty my hands a new product that we recently started carrying is this active fit recovery and massage gel and this is great if you work out a lot if you're an athlete if you're in the gym a lot if you're if you're just putting a lot of stress on your body and your muscles tend to hurt or you've got shin splints or just sore muscles I tend to put it on before I work out if I'm gonna have a really hard workout and then after I work out after I shower but I've started using it at night too before bed because I have been working a lot out a lot and so my muscles tend to be really tight and really sore and this is a great one because this is just a this is a tub you kind of just put your fingers in it and you take what you want and apply it and then that's it and it's got its got like a menthol cooling effect to it so I really like this product too especially if you are a gym before you're starting for me I'm starting to get back into exercising so I'm I'm really aggravating my body and all the muscles as that are already in pain and all the herniated discs that I shouldn't be aggravating so this has been really useful and then my final product that I really love is Khoi healing balm and why do I love this product cuz one it's so small and compact I keep this in my backpack so it's with me at all times it's always it's always within hands reach it's kind of like having chapstick in your pocket keep this on me it's just a little balm love it like if you're just if you just get a flare-up at work sometimes I get tension headaches at work or my neck starts to hurt because I'm on the computer a lot or I start to get carpal tunnel right in my hand right here in my arm right here I can just pull it out and rub it on there it's got like a it's got like a eucalyptus smell to it so it's not overpoweringly menthol but it's got all these essential oils in it instead so I love this one just to keep in my back pocket so those are the four products that we carry and drop your questions down below and we'll get to them thank you so much for paying take that thank you so much for watching oh I need to see video me", "Okpa6QMt51Q": "hi everyone welcome back today i'm going to talk about cbd products that i've been enjoying i've been a little bit more interested in cbd lately because it seems like you know it's this trendy ingredient that's now becoming a mainstay like i think we're going to just continue to see more and more of it so i'm gonna share the products i've been liking all right so let's talk about cbd in skincare products and in our beauty products and wellness products i first was not sold on this as an ingredient to look for just because it seemed a little too trendy the natural skeptic in me was kind of like are they just throwing it onto the label because it's cool to do it now it seems like it's an ingredient that's going to stick around and i think they're starting to find there are some real results that you can get from it it's a natural humectant so it does draw water but at the same time we tend to see it in oil form so we see it in moisturizers or we see it really truly like in an oil form so it can be a little bit confusing whether it's moisturizing or whether it is a humectant but it does draw water so i consider that to be a humectant the thing that stands out to me is that it's anti-inflammatory so that's why i think people really tend to like it when they feel achy is because it's anti-inflammatory so it just calms that inflammation in their bodies whether you have like eczema psoriasis if you have any type of sensitivity for your skin then it might be an ingredient that you can look into there have also been some early studies not conclusive studies but what they're also starting to find is that cbd could be good for oil production to control oil production so that's something that i'm also interested in i'm not 100 sold on that yet but it's something that people are starting to talk about and starting to use cbd for that reason but if you are using cbd truly just for its humectant and moisturizing properties then it definitely does that at the very least there are actually three reasons why i've been very interested in cbd just lately like very very recently in the past like month i've really been interested in it one is because i have scalp psoriasis so i get scabs on my scalp it's very dry it can get flaky it can just be very annoying to deal with like where my scalp just feels like it's almost on fire or it can be very itchy and stuff so because cbd can be hydrating and it can be anti-inflammatory i thought it might be an ingredient to look for in my scalp products another reason is because tada can you see this i'm like lifting up my ankle that's classy i hurt my ankle a month ago and i decided to buy a cream that had cbd in it and it really started to make me focus on cbd the cream has been amazing it's you know i don't know if it's because it has like the menthol type of ingredients in it or because it has the cbd or if it's the combination of both but i have loved it and so i you know i start to really put a little bit of a focus on oh like maybe i should be looking for cbd in some of my products and then the third reason honestly it's just been such a stressful year for everybody not just me i realized that it's been such a stressful year i've had so much anxiety i haven't slept well partially because it's been such a wild year but also because i'm coming out of that like first year of you know having a baby with isla and just starting to you know be able to get some sleep so cbd i'm really really late to it right now but i'm starting to become very interested in it for those reasons that said i'm i'm only just starting to get into it and starting to learn more about it so if you're interested in it or you do know a lot about cbd feel free to let me know more information about it because i'm very interested there are definitely products that i have tried in the past couple of months with cbd that have been so stupid and you know there is definitely a marketing aspect to the cbd products as well so that's also something to keep in mind just because it has cbd doesn't mean it's going to be a great product the other thing that's important to point out is that cbd oil and also hemp oil those are completely different types of ingredients than the thc that is in pot like in marijuana so if you are worried that you're going to get high from you know using like a cbd product you're not unless it says it has thc as well because i have seen those products too that have the combination most of them have some kind of a disclaimer that says it does not have thc it will not get you high and this is purely for the skin care benefits or like the wellness benefits of it all right so let's get into the product starting with this one this is the vita hemp cell energy ampoule and a big thank you to go selly for partnering with me on this video so in this serum they used one of my favorite skincare ingredients niacinamide and they paired it with cbd so that was really interesting to me and it's the reason why i start to give it a try i fully expected this to be kind of like a rich oil feel but it's not it feels like a light oil slash serum and it's kind of a fun application because it comes looking like it's almost in like in a vial and it comes with a little syringe there is no needle don't worry it comes with a little syringe that you you know pop into it and then you just pull out the amount that you're going to use and that keeps it all really fresh which i also think is very interesting because you know we're always talking about like keeping your ingredients fresh and making sure that they stay stable and everything and that's one way to ensure that so you pull out a little bit and then you apply it just like you would a serum it's very hydrating to the skin it immediately starts to plump your skin and give you those hydrating effects that you get from it so in that alone it is anti-aging but it's also very nice for controlling oil production and calming that redness in your skin i've seen a huge difference in the month that i've been using it this is one of those products that is really nice for everyone that's been wearing a mask if you're experiencing any kind of irritation and redness on your skin if you feel like your skin's getting really dry under the mask if you feel like you're getting flaky any of that even with the change of the seasons you're feeling like your skin's feeling a little bit more sensitive because it's colder now this is a wonderful serum to add in especially if you want to get those hydrating benefits it's also great for people with sensitive skin again it's anti-inflammatory you can also use it day and night in your skincare routine these are all ingredients that are really nice like they play well with others so if you are using your actives like your ahas and your bhas or if you're using some type of retinoid at night you can still apply this first to really soothe your skin and while this is for the face and this is how they market it is for your face for the skin for your skincare routine i have been using this on my scalp again they do not claim for this to be something that you use on your scalp it's just that i have really enjoyed using it also on my scalp it was one of those things where i started to feel the texture of it and i was like hmm i really like these ingredients for my face i think that this would be nice for the scalp because of the the feel of it it's very liquidy and i think that's why i like it for my scalp you know like serums and oils that are meant for your scalp like when you're losing your hair and when you are trying to treat something like psoriasis a lot of these serums or these oils haven't really caught up to what we've learned about skin care you know i think about my scalp as skin i feel like it's really important to find the right kind of skincare products for your scalp so while this isn't made for the scalp i have been putting this on my scalp at night and it has really made a huge difference the night before i'm gonna wash my hair i'll take actually like i'll fill the syringe and i will basically just kind of run this through my scalp area and i'll rub it in and then i have another product i'll show you that is more of an oil that also has cbd in it that i've been putting on my scalp and it's really helped to calm it really help to moisturize it again you know like i don't know if it's 100 the cbd in this but i know that this feels really nice on my scalp and it's made a huge difference since i talked about how i use that on my scalp i might as well get into the second product i use on my scalp and that is by briochio this is their be well 100 milligram cbd plus arnica flower soothing skin and scalp oil because the vita hemp really feels more like a serum it absorbs into my scalp really quickly so i've been locking that in again i'm trying to treat it like it's a skincare routine right so i've been locking it in with this oil and the combination really has made such a difference on my scalp if you're one of those people that has just kind of like an itchy scalp in general i'm not saying this is for psoriasis i'm just doing it because i have psoriasis neither of these products are claiming to be psoriasis products just i want to point that out this is just what i've been doing to soothe my scalp i really do think there is a lack of great products for your scalp out there i've got some hair oils for instance when i was experiencing a lot of hair loss after pregnancy where these oils were like full of just essential oils and you know when you turn and look at the ingredients list you're like this is so not caught up with the times like we know a lot more about skincare everybody and we want real skincare ingredients on our scalp the combination of the niacinamide and the cbd from both the serum and from this oil is really just nice for my scalp but also this has arnica in it and we know that arnica is also anti-inflammatory so i just really love this combination it's been working out really nicely for for my hair and my scalp all right so like i said at the beginning of the video i hurt my ankle and i really wanted to find some type of product to put on my ankle just to make it feel better so usually you know i'm like a tiger balm kind of person or like you know like the old school icy hot and stuff but when i was looking for these things on amazon this is the product that came up and it's just called natural hemp cream you know i decided i might as well buy it at the very least it has the menthol in it that i know will help my ankle feel a little bit better but i was again interested in the anti-inflammatory benefits of this hemp oil is the main ingredient of this cream which is which was one of the reasons why i was into it it also had really high ratings which i don't 100 take serious on amazon because it can be all over the place and it also has arnica in it so again we know that arnica is anti-inflammatory i know that the menthol is going to work well and then it has the hemp oil in it so i decided to purchase this and i have loved it the minute i started using it on my ankle it started to feel so much better could it be that it's just that i'm putting something that feels really nice on my skin and i'm also massaging it and everything sure but i do feel like i saw such a huge difference when i started using this on my ankle it's you know fairly inexpensive it's easy to get because it is on amazon it's not fancy at all but it feels really nice i have been using it every single day at least morning and night it's made my ankle feel a lot better i've even been using it on my other foot because since my right foot is not her it gets the brunt of my weight basically and i've been you know putting a lot more work into my right foot and my right ankle so i've been using it to massage both of my feet and my ankle areas it also just feels really moisturizing to the skin so that's been nice too i think one thing to point out is that this has hemp oil in it and not cbd so i had to do a little bit of research on the difference and it's just basically the part of the plant that is being utilized essentially in the cbd and the hemp oil but you're getting a lot of the same benefits from it all right next up is kind of like a treat yo self kind of product this is the prima bath gem i got this off of sephora i bought a couple of these because i don't really take baths as much as i used to anymore mostly because my children have taken over my bathtub so you know when i when i use this i have to essentially like clean out all the bath toys and everything and then you know actually take a bath for myself and it's got to be after the kids have fallen asleep it's a whole deal so i want to make my baths nice when i'm going to take a bath so i got a couple of these i've only used one so far and then i've got this one left but i really enjoyed the experience it's effervescent so you pop it in basically to the water once your tub is filled very similar to a bath bomb but it has cbd in it so again it's anti-inflammatory it's very hydrating and moisturizing for the skin so at the very least we know i'm getting those benefits from it but this also has magnesium in it and i think magnesium is one of those underrated ingredients that people don't focus on for skin and skin healing a lot the best way to get magnesium in our bodies as well which people don't realize is actually through our skin it's not actually taking it as a supplement and i think that's how most people try to get their magnesium but truly the best way to get it is through your skin magnesium is great for so many of our bodily functions it helps to calm us it helps us sleep it helps even our bowel movements and things like that it's just good for your body in general and it's very soothing for your muscles so again because i hurt my ankle i've been looking for products that will just help soothe my pain and like the issues i've been dealing with and this is one of those products that i got so it's not cheap considering that it's just a one-time use little tablet but it is really nice it makes your bath feel like an experience and i'm really excited to use the second one that i got next up i have two moisturizers and by the way i would consider the the hemp cream to be a pain relief cream and not a moisturizer because you don't want that menthol feeling all over your body maybe you do but i don't so i keep it only to my feet and my ankle but the next two products i have are the josie marin skin dope this is a cbd body butter and then i have this by lord jones it is the cbd body lotion so first let's talk about this this is just a nice rich moisturizer it feels good it reminds me of like a really fancy version of my old school favorite like when i was a teenager i was into the body shops mango body butter this feels like this amazing updated elevated adult version of that so i just started using this because it feels so luxurious and like i said i also got this laura jones cbd body lotion this you don't get a lot of product in i feel like i'm going through it so quickly but i really enjoy this lotion again you know i said at the beginning of the video that i have been a skeptic of cbd just because it does feel like so many brands throw cbd onto their products just to claim that they're using cbd because it's trendy and not necessarily to give you any real benefits you know lord jones has created their brand around cbd so it feels like it's a different approach in the sense of you know like they're focusing on cbd and building a whole line around cbd whereas brands that are you know established and then just like kind of including cbd in a couple of their products this one really focuses on cbd as their entire brand this is the signature fragrance by the way it's a very fragrant lotion which i personally enjoy i do feel like i'm going through this pretty quickly especially for the price of a body lotion but it has felt very nice it feels very refreshing to the skin the josie marin i've been using more on like my body after the shower and stuff and this has been a lotion that i've been just kind of like keeping at my desk and using like all my hands on my elbows on my arms like those types of areas when i'm not out of the shower it feels nice and refreshing it almost gives you kind of like a pick-me-up and because it smells pretty it's it takes a place of perfume for me too i can't really say that these products have done more than other lotions for my body but they have felt very nice i only have psoriasis on my scalp right now hopefully it doesn't go to my body but i haven't been dealing with any skin issues on my body so i'm not needing you know cbd for my body besides my ankle obviously because i'm looking for anti-inflammatory products there but they have been very nice body lotions and creams to use and like i said this feels very refreshing and it has this beautiful scent to it i'm just very interested in them i'm telling you i'm using these i like them do i recommend them as cbd products i'm not sure yet but i do like them as moisturizers next up i have these two products from milk makeup one of them is the kush fiber brow gel and then the other is the kush lip balm this is actually just their green dragon lip balm this is not the one that has color to it again we know that cbd is very hydrating moisturizing for the skin so i have enjoyed this lip balm a lot just as just a plain lip balm i've been wearing it before my lipstick you know i've seen people comment you know i was showing off like some really matte lipsticks on instagram the other day and somebody bought it and messaged me and was like this felt really dry and cracky on my lips but it looked really creamy on your lips are you using a lip gloss and stuff and i was trying to think like what is it that makes my lips different like why did that matte lipstick look different on me and i think the difference is that i tend to prep my lips with something like this i've been really enjoying this as a lip prep for my lipsticks because it's not one of those like lip balms that's super shiny and that makes it hard to you know like put a lipstick on top of this feels more like a mix of a lip balm with like a chapstick i know that doesn't sound very elegant but that's kind of what this is it's not shiny i guess is the whole point so it really helps to prep your lips it feels nice and moisturizing and i'm not sure if it's a cbd per se but i know that this is just a really nice lip balm and i've really enjoyed it and also it's got this green tone to it but it doesn't actually leave a color on your lips it just feels really nice but it's clear and then the other kush product that i've liked is the fiber brow gel one i just like fiber brow gel so i was interested in it just solely for that because on the weekends when i'm not really wearing much makeup i'll just swipe this into my brows so that i look a little bit more groomed and pulled together and i also just like that it has color to it because when i'm not actually using a brow pencil to fill in my brows this is usually what i find is all i need if it's just a day like at home or i'm going to be you know like running some errands or something and i'm not wearing a lot of makeup this is all that i need for my brows and the reason why i was interested in this having cbd in is because we know that cbd is conditioning at the very least so i assume that it does that for my brows it conditions them a little bit i've seen a difference in my brows in the sense of you know they feel like they're fuller i've also been using a lash and brow serum so it could be the combination of both or it could be just the serum or it could be this uh nikki uses this on me when she does my makeup just like today and we've really enjoyed this and then last of all my cbd products is this this brand is called recess it's a sparkling water that has hemp extract and adaptogens in it i'm not one that's into these types of drinks they usually taste terrible to me i'm one of those people that has like two to three drinks sitting on my desk almost at all times it's like i have my water a tea and some type of other drink so i thought that these would be nice because they don't have a lot of sugar in them i think like this one has four grams of sugar in it all together and it actually tastes really good there are lots of different flavors to it essentially it's like tea mixed with your sparkling water so it's kind of a nice refreshing drink at the very least it does have the help the hemp extract which i you know hope is helping to calm me down i don't know if it's working but i enjoy it it also has ginseng in it and i i've also been a fan of ginseng for a very long time i don't know if it's because it's like in my blood as an asian or something i've always liked seen my grandma and stuff use ginseng in a lot of products and in her you know like in the things that she would take for wellness so i'm a believer in ginseng and then it has l-theanine and it has lemon balm in it so both of those are just really good for like boosting your mood and stuff basically it's like a mood boosting sparkling water and whether i see a difference or not i've just enjoyed it i guess like that's the best way to explain it it's so hard to tell you guys if i've seen a huge difference in using any of these cbd products because of the cbd but what i can tell you is i've enjoyed the products that i'm talking about period right so that's like the biggest thing that i can tell you is that these are all products that have cbd in them that i really have enjoyed and this drink is one of those drinks it tastes delicious it's a very light refreshing drink i hope it's helping calm anxiety and help me sleep i did you know get like a sleep pillow that has cbd infused in it and it was the stupidest thing i've ever gotten i went back to my regular pillow and just put a silk pillowcase back on it it seemed like it did absolutely nothing for me so there are definitely still things out there that i think are just marketing gimmicks but these have all been products that i i've just thoroughly enjoyed and they happen to have cbd in them so i hope that the cbd is just doing more for me so those are cbd skincare products and wellness products that i have been enjoying tell me in the comments below if there are any products that you're going to try from my list or if you've been using any of these or if there are cbd products that you think i should take a look at i'm very interested in cbd i know that we're only going to see more and more of it on the market another reason why i've been interested in it because you know gotta pay attention see what's happening out there uh tell me why you use cbd or why you don't use cbd because i'm also curious about that find me on instagram i'm at susan yara and i'll talk to you guys soon bye [Music]", "llUiZVO0TEE": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be making CBD infused coconut oil using a double boiler hem there are multiple ways to make diffuse oils and today we'll be going with one of the most common ways the double boiler method which is an easy and effective way to infuse health into the oil note that this method works with all oils and not just coconut oil olive oil vegetable oil grapeseed oil they all work so depending on what you're using it for you can substitute the oil you want to infuse so here you want to start out with a quarter of an ounce of buds or trim per cup of oil of course trim will not be as potent as buds so if you're using trim you can add more if you want the oil to be stronger or if you want it to be less potent then trim is a good choice as always I recommend using decarboxylated hemp to get the maximum amount of potency however here today I'm feeling lazy so I'm just going to add them directly into the oil and let it decarboxylate while it's being infused all I need to do is grind the pound then mixed with the oil in a bowl that can fit on top of a pot inside the pot I'll add about 3 cups of water this will vary based on the size of the pot you're using but you'll need to add enough water so that it doesn't completely evaporate after two hours of simmering but not so much that it'll touch the bottom of the bowl you want the bowl to be heated by the steam of the water and not the water itself for a consistent temperature I'll then put the pot on the stove let it boil and then turn down the heat so that it's slowly simmering and finally place the bowl on top of the pot the bull should fit in such a way that almost no steam is escaping from the pot although there should be enough pressure from the steam that a little will constantly escape the steam will consistently heat the oil up to 212 degrees a perfect low heat that will infuse a CBD in with the oil and not so hot that it will burn off any of the CBD if you saw my video on making butter note that both this double boiler method as was directly simmering in the water method are interchangeable when infusing I like this method more when working with oils because other than coconut oil most oils won't turn solid when cooled which makes it harder to separate from water so although this method will have a stronger flavor since there's no water to remove some of the terpenes and chlorophyll which gives flavor it is a lot easier to produce I stir it a little bit from time to time and let it sit for about two hours to properly decarboxylate and infuse now that the oil is infused you'll want to let it sit for a while before straining it since a lot of the oils are stuck to the plant material you'll want to make sure the oil is not hot to the touch because after filtering it through a cheesecloth you'll want to squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material to get every last drop and that's it the oil is now ready for use and you're storing the oil be sure to keep it in refrigerator or freeze it if you want to store it for long-term use", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now those links will be in the description below I'll also put the recipe for this in the description below and until next time thanks for watching", "wFcIZFQC6Kk": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be making a very much anticipated and requested video from our subscribers today I'm going to be making CBD hand cream or body butter whatever you'd like to call it an oil based cream but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you very much for your support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to continue that support so folks I have received so many emails friends requests and just direct messages about can we make a CBD cream how to make a CBD cream and will you make a video for youtube and the answer to all those questions is yes today I will be showing you how to make a CBD hand cream or body butter now this is not a lotion lotions are water-based for those of you that do not know the difference lotions are a completely water-based and are a totally different recipe and we'll be making that later on so look for that video on our channel but today we are doing an oil based cream or body butter and I'm going to go over the ingredients to be able be able to make it so first and foremost you are going to need sweet almond oil now for those of you that are allergic to nuts you can use avocado oil and I have for this recipe now you're not going to get the same results as we will with the sweet almond oil but for those of you that nut allergy this is a great substitute second you're gonna need cocoa butter this is not the same as shea butter it's a harder texture smells like chocolate so you're gonna need this then next you are gonna need shea butter this is different not the same as coconut butter some people will get them confused and I want to make it clear that these are two separate butters and here we go here is the shea butter it's more malleable definitely have that softer butter texture and then last but not least as far as the cents greediest go for this recipe you will need infuse coconut oil now for those of you that do not have the infused coconut oil you could add CBD pollen or Keef to this recipe however if you want to make the CBD coconut oil that's infused go ahead and check out our video right here on our channel then come on back and after you've made your coconut oil and you start making this recipe so folks that is the essential ingredients to making this hand cream over body butter whatever you'd like to call it the next two ingredients are not essential to this but I will be adding one of the two of them today first is vitamin E oil now it's not necessary but this is a great way to rejuvenate skin it just helps the skin a lot whether it's recovering from damage or just being nice and smooth now you don't need to add it because shea butter has vitamin E in it but this really adds a lot more vitamin E to it to really give you that rejuvenating skin feel the other thing that we are not adding today is an essential oil now if you don't like the smell of chocolate which is what this will come out to smell like because the cocoa butter is very strong you can dampen it and the two I recommend are lavender and mint but today we're not going to be doing that we're cool with the the chocolate smell so let's get right into how I make this CBD hand cream or body butter alright folks before we get started you're going to need a couple things from your kitchen first and foremost a probably a really small spatula to be able to get the oils out of your 1/3 cup measuring cup you'll also need a double boiler or in this case I set it up as a double boiler glass bowl and you have water in the pot we're going ahead and turn that on right now while we're doing all this all right folks now that you've gathered all your kitchen equipment you're just going to need 1/3 cup of every oil and butter so 1/3 cup of cocoa butter 1/3 cup of sweet almond oil and for those of you that using avocado oil it's the same thing 1/3 cup of infused coconut oil and 1/3 cup of shea butter so I'm gonna measure all those out get them into our double boiler and start making our CBD hand cream or body butter so let's get right into it we have measured everything out and we have put it on the stove and as you can see everything's starting to become liquid already now this is the time where you would start thinking about adding your essential oils for us we're just going to do a few drops of the vitamin E so we'll do that you don't need anything crazy maybe five six drops max nothing nothing nuts really just depends on what you like I wouldn't go overboard with the vitamin E though you know ten drops really maximum and so we're just gonna start stirring this around for a little while so we're gonna cut to that so once this all melts down I'll see you in a few minutes okay folks you can see that everything is melted so now we're going to take it off the heat now it's very important this step is that you do not throw it right into the refrigerator you take it off the double boiler and you set it down on the counter get rid of this steam here real quick okay folks so now what you're gonna do is you're going to stir this gently for a little while for about ten minutes you really want it to come down in temperature because first glass can crack and we just put it right into the refrigerator you also want to give the oil some time to rest before you go ahead and cool them down so that's what I'm gonna do for the next ten mathema throw it in the fridge for about an hour and then we'll take it out and we'll whip it so I'll see you in about an hour folks the oil was in the fridge for approximately an hour and a half so a little bit more than an hour and it is now solidified and you really want to get it when it's not totally solid it just transferred over to a solid so it's got that you know loose texture to it and that's important because now what we're going to do is we're gonna whip the oil and this is important because in order to make it a body cream do our hand cream you call a weapon we do this for quite a while and I'll see you okay so we're about halfway done with the whipping here and so what I'm doing is I'm just getting it off the edges and I'm putting it in the middle of the glass bowl here so that we can start whipping it again and I'm going to do this process for a probably about another one to two minutes so I'm going to jump to that next to that alright so now I've lifted for about three minutes and you can tell that it's starting to get that like nice whipped kind of texture to it so what I'm gonna do now is this is the final leg scraped with a bowl because I want to make sure I get everything I can so you can have as much of this body cream as possible but you can tell see it's getting that very whipped type of texture that's what you're gonna look for and you want it to be very fluffy very fluffy and you know kind of Airy just like whipped cream you really want this to have that whipped cream type texture so we're gonna give it one more run through with the blender here and then we'll have the final product alright folks so now we're just gonna store it up and all you need is a mason jar go ahead and just put it right into the mason jar now the great thing about this stuff is it is all ready to be stored it's all oiled so it should be okay on the Shelf you may have to read it if if it deflates for whatever reason but it shouldn't and this should last you quite a while this is a lot of butter or lotion you can use it on your hands use it whatever now it does have a bit of a greasy feel to it and that's typical for body creams and lotions but yeah that's it for today folks I really hope you enjoyed this video I hope you can make this at home and if you guys have any questions comments concerns leave them in the comments below I'll answer them

to get at the product our cbd that stick is a great option and that's just another way that you can incorporate cbd into your daily life", "2hgLax0nSLQ": "hello again teresa here uh i wanted to do a follow-up to my previous review for spruce cbd oil uh which i did back in february or march i believe march probably um i got my first bottle of spruce full spectrum cbd oil 750 milligrams in february after i did some research on using cbd to alleviate my horrible arthritis which is especially bad in my hands and feet and new development in my shoulders now so i i got immediate benefit from the oil and was so impressed with it that i subscribed and i am still a subscriber i still get it every month on time perfectly packaged great shipping it's it's great great customer service um and when i took it before it was i was so just overjoyed because it alleviated the pain in my hands so much that i was able to pick this bad boy up again one-handed and shoot shoot shoot pictures especially in nature and since i was able to get um so back into my passion of photography again i decided what why don't i take this to the next level and start shooting pictures of people so that's what i did and focused on and got all ready to launch it and then covet so shut that down there was no way that was gonna happen who wants to get up close in somebody's personal space especially people you've never met before when there's a pandemic but since my hands were still feeling so good i went back to my passion closet and what else was in there oh my knitting needles in my yarn and my crochet hook so um i've been spending a lot of time doing that again and um if you've ever knitted or crocheted you realize your hands are just key and critical to you have to have the dexterity and the ability to prolonged motions of your hands because my gosh these projects take so long to complete and since you know i was doing this more and more i'm really pushing myself um i i was getting more and more pain in my hands but luckily this company is so incredible they gave me the chance to try a couple of other products including the full spectrum spruce salve which is a thousand milligrams of cbd and the spruce deep chill muscle and joint cream which is 2 000 milligrams of cbd these products are both incredible absolutely work the way they are supposed to um the sav this long eye is odorless um and is made of some amazing things like beeswax and shea butter and oil um cbd oil olive oil i think maybe even some coconut oil same for the deep chill uh same kinds of ingredients natural but with the addition of camphor camp iv and menthol which if you know what that means it's going to smell a lot stronger um and it and it does um and that probably i know might bother some people it's very strong however i personally love mint and that's my favorite so it's great i love that smell and it's just that kind of it's associated with healing in my mind that smell so that helps too but that stuff works instantly it is so great oh my goodness um especially for at least for me for my feet if i have gone for a long walk or if i'm on the treadmill for extended periods of time my feet will become very sore but if i put this on it gone immediately i love to use the sav on my hands i love to use it even if i'm not in pain i love to put it on the backs of my hands because it just makes my skin so soft so it's um the added benefit pain relief so it works great especially in my in my thumb joints i can put that on there and takes the pain away and then i won't have the smell because i've got yarn in my hands and it won't transfer the smell so it works great i'm not sure if i mentioned in my first review how great this oil works for anxiety i was so focused on the pain relief that i was not really even thinking about the anxiety and it really kind of dawned on me how how well it works on that too because i did have terrible anxiety i could work myself up into a frenzy about just anything anything i lost my spoon i dropped my spoon oh my god the world is going to end um it could get pretty bad like that um and i can laugh about it now because i don't really experience it anymore and i know i don't because kovid and i don't leave the house uh rarely do i go anywhere outside of my yard and in olden days i would have i would have just been a complete basket case um absolutely down the rabbit hole of what if what if what if and honestly this is still going on it feels like there's no end in sight immediately anyway so it's gonna keep going on like this for a while and i'm totally fine with it i've got my knitting needles and i've got my yarn i've got my cbd oil and i've got my set i mean what else do i need it's um great it's so great for pain relief it's so great for um a sleeping aid which just you know pain relief and your anxiety's gone it's easier to sleep so um i just wanted you to know that i am a subscriber i love it i can't imagine my life without it honestly i'll always take it because arthritis pain doesn't get better it only just gets worse so i know i have some i have a little friend who will help me with that um and another kind of interesting aspect of it that i've noticed is since i know so well in my heart and mind that this product is so natural and so um good for me the ingredients are all so good for me it subconsciously makes me want to live a more healthy life i want to continue putting more good things like this into my body i only want to put these good things into my body and i i want them all to taste like this oil taste because i love i love the flavor of it the peppermint and the hemp oil it's just fantastic so um i encourage you to um if you have any questions please leave them below i would be happy to

in the plant as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products [Music] [Music] hello I'm Benjamin at the Asher and I'm here in one of Asher's our own fields where are your farmer Zephaniah has been growing a beautiful crop of CBD hemp Zephaniah is a fourth-generation farmer on this exact field so it's kind of in his DNA to know what the plants need ganic farming has definitely been a passion of our family for a long time my grandfather started farming nearly 50 years ago organically well in the early 70s out of conviction that it was that Hearst family's health and after a few years of organic farming health issues started preparing up this really began our multi-generational passion for helping women now raising my own family I'm so grateful for healthy living soil that they can play in free from chemicals or harsh fertilizers someplace that's building their immune system [Music] and farming this way has been a family project there's often 20 or more family members aunts uncles cousins and their children all out in the field planting and making big projects you know hemp is known as one of the best plants for pulling up wolf minerals and toxin from deep down in the soil these minerals and toxins are then concentrated the CBD oil and planter as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products being certified organic is an absolute but even that doesn't keep the plant from pulling up heavy metals and other toxins that are deep in the soil from years of chemical use this is what makes your hemp crop so special for CBD hemp it is probably the oldest organic chemical free farm in the country growing in a volcanic rich soil and fed all year with fresh spring water from Mount Hood so instead of pulling up garbage from deep in the soil these plants are pulling up more minerals and nutrients which are converted into a deeper and wider spectrum of healthy oils the farm is also processing a portion of the cropland 'south and teachers right on site first the plants are hang dried and cured at low temperatures for a couple weeks in order to preserve as much of the fitness of the plant as possible this is far superior to sending the crop to mechanical heated fryers for an hour 99% of the CBD products are extracted at sophisticated labs using harsh chemical solvents extreme pressures temperatures multiple fractionation steps designed to pull certain components out and putting others back in then what is left they dilute back in a carrier oil like coconut oil but there's a simpler method one that you can easily do at home by just gently soaking the flours in organic coconut oil until all the natural oils and goodness is pulled out of the plant this easy tried-and-true extraction method has been used for thousands of years to pull all the goodness out of the plant and one simple step so whether you choose to buy the whole plant and make your own CBD product or by Asher's pre-made you can feel good knowing the farmer that grew it and how it was made using the purest wholesome certified organic product available anywhere sure check out the links below for details on how to make your own CBD oil right in your kitchen hey hi everybody David from Azure and hey today I want to talk once again a little bit about organic hemp him kind of used to scare me I always kind of thought hey it's a bit of a fad it's edge people are just saying things about it because it's not legal everywhere but after I began to become more knowledgeable when our customers begin to request this over and over again can you get CBD products we really want this pain creamer these great CBD products and I said so I began to research it and I researched it in a big way and I realized that there is something to that there is something amazing about some of these CBD type products so I asked our customers in Facebook and that would have been this last spring I asked the customers hey would you like a journey carried CBD products is that important and overwhelmingly everybody said it was very important so I began to research but to find the very best our customers expect the best we want to get them the best so I begin to research and I could have had a horrible time finding the best very little of the product was really organic certainly not certified organic much of it was weak much of it was not respect to the label it was very disheartening to to go through that and a lot of it grown on land that was not properly organically grown for many years that pasture or something else where chemicals or heavy metals could have leached into the product so I came to the conclusion that hey Roger has farm ground will grow it will grow some for our customers and because that's what we do Asher's had been organic since 1973 one of the oldest organic pieces of ground in the state this will be a great piece of ground to put this hemp on so we planted this spring a crop of hemp out here in the fields and it grew beautifully so today we have the hemp harvested it's dried down it's ready to go and I want to be able to offer to sell you just plain dried him why is this important most the time people are selling CBD products and we will - however you can do it yourself you can make the CBD products out of this dried raw here and control the process completely don't have to put any chemicals and you don't want to you can put all the other you can make variations with other things that suit exactly what you need my wife did that she made a really cool recipe of CBD salve that she uses in our

going to enhance the benefits of you know soothing and comforting your tired sore muscle so that's another great way to use it a lot of folks that come in and see us here at the store have a lot of foot peds whether it's just age wear and tear if you've had an injury in your foot a lot of times that can be very irritating and disruptive to your daily life because everyone uses their feet you know most of us walk and are bearing all of our weight on our feet and so the soreness of that can really become unbearable to some folks so at the end of the day I suggest taking about a dime to a quarter-sized amount of the CBD balm and just giving yourself a nice foot massage rubbing and concentrating on the areas that really need the attention and some you know relief from that discomfort another really great way to use CBD oil fall if you're like me year-round you have dry lips it's crazy but it's something that I always struggle with it's worse in wintertime and when the weather is colder but cvd balm is a great way to moisten your lips Phoebe is full of great omega-3 fatty acids so it's a wonderful oil that is really going to heal and feel chapped lips it's as easy as just taking it to your finger like you would any other type of you know moist lip moisturizer [Music] it actually smells minty fresh and really I think gives as much of a nice glossy glow to your lip as a cosmetic product with a high-end cosmetic product so this is another great way to use CBD oil now if you're headed outside into some really cold weather or you're stuck inside with the heat on you might be noticing that the air is really really dry and that can become super irritating to your sinuses one thing I suggest with the CBD oil balm is to simply take a small amount of it in your finger and rub just underneath your nasal passage this way when you're breathing in the air has a chance to hit the oil and go up into your nasal cavity so if your nasal passages are even more dry and you need some more therapeutic effect on the CBD oil another thing you can do is actually use a cotton swab to scoop up just a small amount less than a pea-sized amount I would say pea-sized at most this is gonna seem kind of gross to you but really it's well worth it if the inside of your nose is really dried out and irritated and discomfort you're experiencing a lot of discomfort you're going to want to try this yes I am totally picking my nose on down but it seriously feels so good after you're able to moisten the inside of your nose definitely throw this cotton swab out when you're done is you don't want to be spreading all those nice germs but doing this is really going to give you a lot of relief and there's another great way to ensure that all the air that you're breathing is really moisturized and beneficial for you if you're in the kitchen a lot and your clock sometimes burns happen well fortunately or unfortunately I don't have any fresh burns to show you here today but I've never heard of an old one that's been lingering on my hands here from a hot pan I was cooking with a couple of weeks ago one great use for CBD oil is actually after this burn happens apply directly to the area very gently you don't want to use this on any exposed skin so skin that's been broken leading anything like that you don't want to use on exposed skin but for any other skin especially burns this works so wonderfully because the omega-3 oils in here are so beneficial at really healing your skin and it feels so good using our hands on the keyboard all day long can result in a lot of discomfort and our fingertips of stiffness sometimes even swelling you may have seen a doctor about this and told you you had a type of condition that we're all pretty familiar with but if the discomfort is really getting to you you may want to consider keeping a bottle of the CBD balm at your desk and just taking a bit of that you can combine it with a hand cream that you may have or a hand oil of some sort or you simply on its own and you just want to apply to the area's focusing on especially we join and areas of discomfort and basically work it into your whole hand as you would a hand cream and let it sit for just a few moments so that the oils have a chance to soak in before you go and use your hands again I promise you you will feel some type of relief from this discomfort most of us at some point in our lives or we may know somebody has suffered from acne and I'm talking about big cystic painful acne those giant bumps that come out out of nowhere and believe me they're not just teenagers that get them it can be really painful and sometimes we can even feel them coming up out of there out of our skin before they even start revealing themselves if that's the case like combat this with CBD oil CBD oil is naturally anti-inflammatory the cystic acne is inflammatory in nature so you want to fight that with good fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids and CBD oil is so rich in them it just takes a tiny little bit of the bomb and you want to just apply directly to the areas on your face that are breaking out and then try this at night when you wake up the next day see what happens so many of us also suffer from migraine settings or just tension headaches these are really common at the end of a long day especially if you've been staring at a screen of some sort your computer a lot of times we feel the tension at our temples over here what you want to do is take just a bit of the CBD balm it doesn't take much and rub into your temple it goes on really nicely it does not feel overly greasy and it will absorb very easily if you just focus inward and use a few minutes of your time to concentrate on addressing the discomfort you can massage the oil in wherever it is on your face even in your scalp if it goes into your scalp that's perfectly fine to get this into where your hair is you may also know somebody that suffers from skin rashes Gailey itchy dry skin again they may have seen a doctor for this condition and that's great to be under a doctor's care but something you can do very easily for yourself if you use some CBD oil directly on those areas of irritation on your skin again as long as there's no exposed skin or you know bleeding areas cuts you don't want to apply the CBD to those areas but others extremely dry itchy scaly flaking skin the CBD oil is incredibly moisturizing and beneficial for skin it's just a matter of rubbing it into the area that's affected last but certainly not least if you or someone you know experiences joint discomfort CBD oil is great for taking or relieving some of that discomfort you want to focus on the areas that you're experiencing this elbows knees knuckles and just give it a good rub in sometimes you know you can benefit from a little bit of massage in that area to really make sure the oil is kind of treating the skin and absorbing and just give it a few moments let it absorb see how you feel okay I just do that again I'm feeling very good now I'm covered in CVD we could do the helical little thing I do", "b04qWvyoyxo": "[Music] hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life again today today in fact we would chat a little bit about topicals I've got two brand-new topicals coming out from ab annoyed botanicals that I'm pretty excited about and I do get a lot of questions on the skincare products so I thought we could just talk through a couple of them today and I'll let you know what I think so first up let's talk about face serums with the new topical from AB annoyed I have two different options for facial serums the first one is from made by hand and it's been my go-to for well over a year now it is a nice thick serum there's 100 milligrams of CBD in this bottle so we know that CBD is awesome for neutralizing our insides this is going to help us neutralize our outsides as well have oil and CBD are considered to be skin normalizer so that should if you're more dry or more oily this should help you get back to that middle range which is what most of us are going for I know I am especially so this one is nice and thick when you shake it up and pull it out it kind of looks like honey there is actually honey that is in the formula and I usually apply it by putting it on the back of my hand I always put it on my left hand which means that my left hand is significantly softer than the back of my right hand but this you can just take it and rub right into your skin I do actually already have makeup on so I'm going all over makeup which is weird but hey it's effective this one is super super thick I am in Michigan so Michigan in the winter especially right now not super awesome so this is perfect for wintertime skin a nice thick serum I do also put it sometimes in the cuticles and my fingers and then the ends of my hair cuz I get that crazy dry staticky yuck and I found that the oil tones those down as well um so let's compare that to the new guy from Avenue D I have been lucky enough to be a beta tester on this product for the past couple months I've been using it for a little bit this still has 100 milligrams of CBD so same see me content this one is in a spray pump top versus that dropper top matter of personal preference the dropper top since I've been using that for a while like I'm telling you I've definitely knocked it over and spilled it especially if I'm hasty in it don't screw the top on as well as I should so dropper talks a little nicer that way haven't yet gotten down to the bottom of my bottle but it looks like it winds around so I should be able to get everything out if by some chance there's a little bit left in here that the dropper top can't pull out I would always just unscrew the top and use it that way so this guy sprayed top still shake it up a little bit squirt it into your hand you're going to find I can't really get a good angle on that can I you're gonna find that it's not quite as thick so this I think is awesome for me personally for fall and for for summertime because it is a little bit lighter for your skin and again I'm the goofy one who puts it in my hair and let my fingernails as well right now I'm actually using both of these as part of my routine I'm using the thicker one at night and the a monoid later serum in the morning so I am using it twice a day that's working really well for me personally so same amount of CBD different top and then there are different additional herbs this guy has orange oil he's got honey and rose hip in there this one has a really more herbs and different ones as well we've got blue chamomile we've got mango butter patchouli jasmine cinnamon mark vanilla bean so all kinds of fun herbs in here really good stuff both of them both of them are going to be that oil base that 100 milligrams of CBD so really good stuff for your skin the other item that I wanted to chat about a little bit is the me buddy haven't muscle in joint South this one's almost gone because it is my husband's absolute favorite thing he puts on every morning on his feet and on his knees it does last him a good long time it's a really thick salve when you open it up it's sort of a green color from that hump and it's easy to get out just a little bit right on the end so if you've got sore knees feet anything like that this maid might have staff has been my go-to for quite a while Abbe annoyed has launched a salve as well I'm still gonna be in a little tin that you can open up and just get to work on these this guy is a hundred milligrams of CVD in the tin two M's tin the new AB annoyed version is 150 and it's got some different herbs in there as well I have actually not tried that out yeah so I'm looking forward to giving it a shot and seeing what I think again 50% more CBD and the retail price on it is actually the same so there's there's a benefit they're made by hump does have peppermint and lavender which for me personally work really nicely with that CBD and I see a benefit there one thing to keep in mind is any time you're putting CBD on your skin it's this stuff is not getting down into your bloodstream so I have lots of customers that ask is it okay to use a topical level and use a CBD that I'm eating and taking internally and the Internet is yes absolutely personally I take a tincture every day and I use these products on my skin every day I do also vape that's something that I do as part of my personal routine just if I'm having a bad day or I'm stressed out in an in a little bit of a boost then all day pose well but a tincture is generally my go-to along with these skin products so I'm always here you can email call any questions that you've got I'm happy to help I hope that it was a little bit helpful to get an idea of these products thanks so much [Music] you", "zkPf_U2mEN0": "hi everybody this is Susan Eliot and today we're going to be making our Lian bomb it's a mad soothing Lian bomb now I'm going to say a few words about recipes I am going to do another video just about recipes in my soapy business uh series but for now I just want to talk about recipes I have three types of recipes I have recipes that a basic that I basically give away and I most likely have taken them from someplace else someplace like nature's garden or bramble berry and there's a few very generous suppers on the internet who give away recipes and so I learned from other people I believe we've all have a duty to give back to new people who are coming on and so I have those that I give away freely the other one is I've tweaked the basic one and I usually tell you what my tweak is I might not give you exact measurements and the reason why I do that is because sometimes my tweaks and my modifications don't work out for other people depending on where you live what your customers are like what you know what supplies you're using so I don't give it because I'm trying to keep it to myself I give it because I can't troubleshoot it if it doesn't work for you the third one is something like I'm going to do today it's like I took me a lot of months to come up with it of course I put all of my ingredients on the label so all you have is wearing my label and know how it goes there's a few different steps that you should be aware of when you're making um a muscle balm like this and I'm going to tell you what those are and you know but basically I'm not going to give you the exact recipe it took me months to come up with this and you don't need everything that I put into it this is my sort of super-duper muscle balm this is the the top of the line you could use only some of these ingredients I'll tell you which ones are necessary which ones are not and and have a perfectly fine bomb you could also I don't use any petroleum products you could also use petroleum jelly in place of the salve that I make myself at the beginning of this and I will you know I mean it's perfectly fine if that's what you want to do if you don't if you don't do your own herbal infusions like I do if you don't want to make your own SAP you can use petroleum jelly I don't use drilling products but you can't so what I want to do is tell you what's absolutely necessary ah this is a mask when you're working with menthol which is absolutely necessary you want to be wearing a mask it can get it makes me nauseous some people have trouble when they breathe it in some people it makes them nauseous for me it makes me nauseous that's why I wear a mask please wear a mask whenever you're you're messing around with menthol the other thing is I'm going to make a salve that's going to be the basis of that so if you don't have a SAP you need to have petroleum jelly and this is my recipe pads here I wonder where it went to um so for the SAP I mean these wax that I use local locally sourced organic beeswax so in order to make the salve I need that I need my fuse oils which I'm going to use my own comfrey and my own calendula infused oils do not use any comfrey and few soils on and open on a deep open wound you can use up on superficial wounds but this is a muscle bomb so it really should just go on muscles where there's no deep wound comfrey is so healing that it heals the surface so fast that the skin does not have time to regenerate underneath if it's a deep wound and actually can cause an infection so don't ever use any comfrey based product on a deep wound you could use it on superficial wounds you could use it on rashes you can even use it on broken bones it's great but don't use it on deep wounds I use vitamin E I put vitamin E and all of my bombs all of my self it's just about every product I make has vitamin E in it you need the mental and you need a camphor this is camphor essential oil and basically that's all you need you need the basic salve which in my case I'm going to make myself and I'll show you some of that you need the menthol you need the camphor that and that's it that's all you really need if you use the petroleum jelly instead of the the SAP I also put in cajuput essential oil lavender essential oil frankincense essential oil eucalyptus central oil wintergreen essential oil peppermint essential oil and clove bud essential oil so that's what I use in my top-of-the-line muscle balm you don't have to use all these essential oils you really just need the mental the camphor and the the base to put it in either salve or petroleum jelly but this is my top of the line I make ones that are less potent and they don't have all of these in so I'm going to get started and I also have my jars they are boiling in water so that they're sterilized and I'm going to clean up a bit and then we'll get started now the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to make the salve now the basic recipe for the salve is an ounce of beeswax to a cup of oil so I'm going to take my calendula and my Humphrey oil and I'm going to do half a cup of each one I just did these so that is the comfrey very dark very successful infusion it's very happy with it if you saw the video oh this is Michelangelo this is chamomile which is which is fine and I do make this with a with calendula and I do make it with chamomile today we're going to do chamomile and come a you don't even have to make a salve you can use a petroleum jelly or you can just use a carrier oil with the beeswax you don't you don't have to have infused oil that's just something that I like to do so I have my cup of of oil and now I'm going to slice off an ounce of beeswax oh I know what I was missing I was missing shea butter I put shea butter in my my balm as well and that's because I really wanted to have a nice consistency when all is said and done so I knew there was something else that I was missing so it's the shea butter okay so I have chopped off an ounce of beeswax and I'm going to put this away and I'm going to melt the beeswax and a double boiler so I'm going to do now is I'm going to put the melted beeswax into the oil and it's going to solidify like almost immediately there we go there we go have nice solid and what you can do at this point is you can put this back into the water so that it it melts again or you could heat up the oil before so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this back in here and get all that these wax out and then I'm going to put the this back in the water now it's all melted and now it's going to cool down and it's going to create a salve if you keep scraping the sides down everything will become a salve now it's a dark green because of the comfrey if it was not if the comfrey was not involved in this it would not be so dark green it would be more like a pale yellow or even a beige but because the comfrey is so dark it's so you see it it's getting very gelatinous and you just mix it around now if you wanted this to be the extent of your product this would be a great great healing salve chamomile and comfrey like I said it's good on everything bruises rashes superficial cuts not deep cuts because the comfrey is so healing it's one of the only things as you can say don't use this because it's too good but it really heals so quickly that it doesn't give the bottom layers enough time to to really do its job so this is mixed up fairly well it looks great so there's a little piece it looks like a little piece of comfrey with them in the oil so anyway this is the South that we're going to use is the basis and I'm going to prepare the menthol and show you what we do so it's important to weigh out exactly how much salve you're going to have when you're finished so this is 5.8 so then I'm going to put in probably half that for a for shea butter and I'm probably going to put around half of that for menthol so I have put the shea butter and the menthol chips in together and I'm going to put them in the double boiler and let them melt and like I said this is where you definitely want to put your mask on now while that is melting what I'm going to do is I'm going to weigh out my oh the menthol is already trying to get to me uh-huh I'm going to weigh out my oils my essential oils and I can tell you that a lot of times it's so light when you when you're dealing with something like this it doesn't really measure out so know how many drops is in you know an ounce or whatever the thing that's the most important is the camphor oil so try to make sure you have at least an ounce of the camphor and you can you know take it from there and try to figure out how many drops are are in it but I'm not going to make you sit through that but I'm just telling you that's how I came up with it because sometimes the scale just doesn't pick up on measuring the essential oils until you've got more than you need ok this is 2 ounces of camphor oil and the next thing that I'm going to need is an ounce of of clove and then cajuput and then everything else I usually put in you know from a few drops to half an ounce okay so our shea butter and our our Ben Thal is nicely melted we have our essential oils and vitamin E right here and like I said the only thing you absolutely need for for muscle balm is the menthol the camphor and some sort of base you know which we made our own comfrey chamomile staff everything else is is optional and I put peppermint eucalyptus and wintergreen in there you really only need one of those I just like this really strong this is for me and I have a lot of really really difficult muscle issues and you know I have lupus so I have a lot of aches and pains and this stuff is just magic the frankincense is also very expensive you don't need that I find that it works better for me you don't need the lavender that works better for me I find the clove to be something that you do need an essential essential oil for this but you could get away without it if you want something very light you know just go with the menthol the camphor and you know add some cajuput a little bit of the clove and you're good to go you know with your base either petroleum jelly or making your own Saveur liniment so anyway I'm going to wait for this to cool down to 120 before I add my essential oils and now mix it all together in the meantime I am sterilizing my jars if this is going to go into and I also have Saint John's wort um which I just got today and so I'm going to be making and infused oil with that so so I have a bigger mason jar in there but I have the smaller jason mason jars in there for this SAP okay so we're almost ready to get going again my this is the shea butter and the mental chips they're almost down to 120 which is where I want them so that I can put the essential oils the vitamin E in and then we'll add the salve as well I have my my little jars have come out of the boiling water where they boiled forever and ever in seen and this is for me so I am OCD and I do um really take a lot of precautions that might seem like overkill to some people and it probably is but that's the way I do it so you know I'm going to make sure that you know these are absolutely dry so that we're not introducing any water into this because we all know that water breeds bacteria and fungus so one of the things that I was saying before about recipes is you know I have basic recipes that I freely give away because people gave to me when I first started making products like this I have other ones that I usually give you the tweaks I might not give you the exact amounts but it get is because your supplies my different than mine where you live might be different then you know how things behave where I live etc etc and then there's ones that you know it's like this you're going to read all of this on the label this recipe took me a very long time to come up with and to get it right now I gave you a sort of an idea of the Rhett you know the recipe and and the amounts but I didn't give you the exact ones because you don't need everything that I put in here you can make a perfectly nice one you know by yourself with it with different things I showed you what was necessary what was not necessary if I go onto somebody's video and they say I never give out recipes I turn it off I never go back there again I will not give them views there are some techniques that people use that yes you do want to see but if somebody's just sitting there making a soap I'm not going to sit there and watch them hand blend some some oils and lye together when they're not showing me anything that I don't already know how to do I don't care and if you're so selfish like you're not curing cancer you should have I believe you can have your proprietary recipes you don't want to give to other people but everybody should have some recipes that they give to new Sopris because people gave to us we didn't learn this in a vacuum we didn't wake up one day know how to do this stuff so if you're you know think that you're so magnificent now you can't share any recipe with anyone ever I will not give you the views on your videos I just won't and I believe that everybody should have some basic recipes that they share with others that they let people know where they've gone from they can point them to the resources you know things like that then there's the other ones where you say you know I took this basic recipe from so-and-so and I put this twist on it you know and then there's ones like this where it's like yeah this is what you absolutely need to make a muscle balm but all these other ingredients you could put in make make it you know really good but you don't have to so I encourage people if you go to somebody's site and they say I don't give out any of my recipes ever shut them off don't give them views it's ridiculous if they have some great technique that you really want to learn you know be a piping or making layers of soap or something like that fine but if it's just them putting some oils and lye together and and dumping it in a mold a big deal who cares like just don't go back there that's what I say so I think that everybody should give back to new Soper's like people gave to me because I didn't know what I was doing and I watched it's videos before I ever started this the other thing that I wanted to say is if when you use in menthol if you don't wear glasses like I do or even if you do and your your eyes are particularly sensitive you might want to put on goggles because the mental affects your your eyes as well and you know it's great if you have a cold or something clear everything up but if you don't you definitely want to cover your your nose your mouth and your eyes so anyway this is 121 we're almost there so like I've shown all my videos you know I alcohol things down especially just gonna be for sale this isn't for sale this is just for me but I do it anyway so this is the spoon that I'm going to use to mix and you know I will alcohol this down I just need a paper towel to do that so I have my alcohol spoon and I'm going to check my temperature should be down below 120 and then I'm just going to mix the essential oils and it is 119 ok here we go let's see I'm just going to this is the essential oils and a vitamin E and if you're going to use vitamin E and let's make sure it's a real vitamin E not you know some crap that they're you know if you look closely it says you know 2% vitamin E or something like that because there's a lot of people out there I would do it ok so that is very strong between the menthol and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to mix in my fabulous fabulous salve this is all going to mix together if you give us what petroleum jelly I don't know how comes out because I've never used it but I assumed that it would be the same thing I can smell the menthol I could smell the camphor now all I got to just get this mixed really well I think I'm actually going to use my hand blender for a minute me trusty stick bag where I'd be without it obviously this is from two different I just grabbed the first bottom and the first top that I saw so it's a little liquidy but I definitely will great so it is liquidy you can see that and you know because the shea butter will firm up and the beeswax the liniment will firm up this will all firm up I'm going to pour this into the jars and let you see see it it pours and this will all this will all firm up and this is one reason why you don't always give out recipes because if for some reason this didn't firm up which I'm sure it well because I've done this just people gonna come to you and say oh I'm one didn't firm up what happened and if this if that happened if this didn't firm up but you stay like this I would just make another salve base and then I would just put it all together until you know was the point that it did but I'm just going to give this a little bit and I'll bring you back while I was waiting for this to set up I did my uh st. John's wort infusion and I want to show you this Saint John's wort is one of the few herbs that I would suggest putting a little bit of oil in the bottom because it's so dense that sometimes it can take a long time for the oil to go all the way through so I just put a little bit at the bottom I probably should have showed you that but anyway this is the st. John's wort it's in sunflower that I have rosemary only arisen in apricot oil and extra virgin olive oil some people have asked me why don't you I'm an oil and you can absolutely use sweet I'm an oil to do infusions it's a great oil to do infusions but I don't use it for people that have allergies because I figure people with nut allergies have enough problem sometimes finding products so I try to make you know my healing balms my healing salve you know very you know nut allergy friendly so anyway so see this is setting up and it will continue to set up as as it firms up okay this has firmed up look at it it looks and smells amazing this is you can see it it's just lovely I'm going to take a little bit I'm going to put it on my very icky shoulders amazing amazing it's creamy it's wonderful so this is our top of the line lion balm if you want it you can order it you you", "QH1GEuMw8Dc": "hey this is jeremy orozco and today we are going to go on a magical journey to see if varritus farms is real faritas means truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "AinA_wKFQe4": "hello CBD fans it's Brad from hemp remedies wwm pyramides calm also have remedies on Facebook you can look for me personally on Instagram I don't have a business channel yet however I have my own a moist person videos on there most importantly guys if you are watching this video please take a second to like and subscribe to the channel I'm constantly doing product video product demo videos and when I do when I launch a video you'll get an email notification that way you'll have first dibs at the products when they come in today I am so excited I finally got in my company's DVD saw this is hemp remedies reliefs of what makes this sub different than the majority of the other sobs on the market is the other sobs made by the big manufacturers have about fifty milligrams sometimes 100 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar now those are excellent products I sold many of them so I always say in my videos I was one of the first in the industry I've been in the business since 2013 prior to that I had a medical marijuana company so I've been around for a long time I have also been the sole CBD provider to numerous patient groups so I've have a lot of interaction with people and how the products work the sobs that were on the market prior to this fifty maybe a hundred milligrams of CBD many great products they were all made with the same starting oil all of these manufacturers used the same starting oil to make their products that was imported in from the Netherlands it's quality oil guys non-gmo organic pesticide free organically grown I've seen I used to sell it by the kilo I've seen labs on every single batch while the stalk and stem oil is great oil what you're not getting is the terpenoid profiles minor cannabinoid profiles as well that you find in the flower of the plant and that's because importation rules would not allow them to use the flower so everything was made with the stalk in stem oil which again same CBD and the stalkin stem is the same CVD that's in the flower you just didn't get that big minor turpenoid or minor cannabinoid and turpenoid profiles that you would find in flower oil so you don't get the entourage effect in Turkey an interplay this is my new Saab I am starting it out at five I have it at 500 and 1000 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar way stronger way more much more CBD in these products than you would find in the other manufacturers and it's true whole plant so that means that the stalk and stem what I was still used which is excellent Oriole it has all of the fats and healthy oils that you find in the plant that's very good for you but it's also got oil from the flower as well so you get the terpene or clay you get all the terpenes in there the minor cannabinoids much more relief much higher quality product so I'm very excited about this and to bring those guys to you it's going to be on the website now I am waiting for labels to be finalized and shipped to me until then I will be shipping it out without labels with a CoA stating what's in the product right from the lab yeah very excited about those guys I also have a texture that's in a 2 ounce bottle that's whole plant it's got no glycerin Zoar any type of additives to it it's in a coconut oil base the flavorings natural orange made from distilled oranges and I also have them lavender from distilled lavender plants so everything is all-natural the textures go 500 milligrams all the way up to 5000 and I have a vioient made the same way it's in a coconut oil base so there's no polyethylene glycol and a vegetable glycerin all natural flavors from either distilled oranges or lavender so I'm excited about that that should be on the website in the next couple of days and of course I made the world's first legal CBD CBD dad back in 2014 called early I have that out right now at 800 milligrams per gram or 1 ml serving whole plant pesticide free organically grew and just like all the other products and I have the new wax crumble got a sample of that right here this is just mind-blowing stuff it's a true wax crumble from whole plant oil CBD on this and batch was 94% 940 milligrams of CBD and a gram so with that being said I want to thank you guys for your time make sure you like the page the YouTube channel subscribe to it I would be ultra grateful if you shared any of these videos on your Facebook page Facebook is not allowing me to run sponsor two ads again so that's super appreciated and keep your eyes peeled for my next video", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "zaAk6S4EbgI": "hi jeremy rusco here with another cbd review of extract labs they're muscle cream i sent it to two labs to see if it's real cbd i'll go over the lab test the strength including what's in it the aroma the price breakdown my thoughts as well as the company in my previous test on that company extract labs let's see if they are full of cannabinoids or something else 90 bucks gets you 1500 milligrams of full spectrum cbd claimed disclosure i do use affiliate links to help pay for all this i actually pay for the products myself this is not sponsor i don't get free products and i pay for these two independent lab tests in california they're blind tested so you know what you're getting is real actual lab certs are here labs produce different results based on different testing methodologies and consistencies in the product or different ingredients it gets a little more difficult with creams and that's why we have two lab tests okay and this one i compared as total cannabinoids because extract labs doesn't specifically state if this is 1 500 milligrams of total cannabinoids or just cbd all right 7 to 14 more is good and if they mean cbd levels by that 1500 milligram lab b shows 1522 milligrams for this 1500 milligram tin right spot on i always give the companies the benefit of the doubt especially with creams and when i know they're pure oil tests test well with me more on that in a second this is full spectrum of beautiful full spectrum with a bunch of cannabinoids that's what full spectrum means let's see the gram breakdown here there's 80 grams in this tin this is uh this is powerful 18 or 19 milligrams of cbd per gram up to 1.3 milligrams of thc around 0.6 milligrams of cbc and up to 0.4 milligrams of cbg that is great over one milligram of thc may provide some additional relief to this and current research says that topical thc doesn't pass into the blood which means no high effects or drug test problems according to the research you look into that look that research over and don't listen to this cbd guinea pig now here's the the best part this is a good full spectrum mix of cannabinoids which usually means a full mix of some nasty hemp smells none no hemp smell none at all i was very surprised by this it smells great and by all means tell me if you think i'm full in the comments below it helps this channel grow and i like to get your opinion as well or just say hi help me out i would describe this as a natural peppermint scent that's uh that's subtle it has just a little spice smell to it just just a bit i might be able to smell the sage pine smell in here maybe it's just more of a sweet peppermint smell with a little spice but it's not it's not overbearing the added ingredients are simple and natural organic i like that they use menthol lavender book proven useful in muscle rubs for a very very long time lots of research on those the arnica webmd listed as commonly used for arthritis and post surgery that's the one with the pine sage odor the good smell as always i don't talk about my personal relief because it could be misleading or even harmful for people everyone has a different tolerance to cbd based on their individual in the cannabinoid system plus you really can't trust a cbd guinea pig like me with how many different products i use on a regular basis however i do use muscle rubs and i will say that so far this is by far my favorite cbd cream by a landslide i wasn't expecting it because some of my favorite cbd companies for tinctures oils really didn't pull through when it came to the topicals you'll see those reviews soon my goal is to never sugarcoat cbd products if you haven't seen my other reviews i try to find something terrible about every company just to bring a little more joy to this world this muscle cream is just uh it's just clean it i love that it has different cannabinoids without the hemp smell it's the color is a milky white color like a uh paste which i didn't think i'd like the paste but i actually do it comes in this high quality tin it's uh called the lock tin it's patented i'm not sure if it's their patented or something else's but it's super nice and uh i do like products where you feel that it's high quality and then the product is equal to that high quality package that you're getting the full package the price okay six cents ten cents is about average for tinctures in 2020 the drops you put in your mouth you could uh get cbd for as low as two cents but it's it's not going to be like this i'll tell you right now finding a good cbd cream with a lot of cannabinoids at this price well i haven't found any other like this yet i've got more tests on the way but so far this is my favorite the price is excellent for what it is i like the cbd medic the review that i just did almost as much as this but then it's like well it didn't have the extra cannabinoids the thc it was weaker and it was three times the cost of extract labs which is better all around my opinion and as far as the company extract labs i tested two of their tinctures in the past extremely accurate i gave them a cbd examine authenticity award it's veteran owned and they give steep discounts to people in need great company all-around great company a favorite on reddit with excellent prices okay so great company look at the lab results look at the cost take my opinion with a grain of salt you need to try cannabinoid products yourself to see if they work for you plus all the extra products and cream you might not like menthol my favorite might be your least favorite but i think this is going to be a lot of people's favorites oh and one thing on the label i forgot to mention you're not supposed to get this near your eyes they make a face cream for that i didn't get it near my eyes but i did use the banyo right after and let me tell you menthol it's a little little tingly you don't want it near your eyes or other sensitive areas unless you're into that tingly feel i will see you next time you", "VfLW9TnHTRc": "hi everybody it's broken Sierra here love happy Monday it is a gorgeous day it's very nice I had lunch and chatted all about what we're talking about today which is topicals but anyway I hope you guys get a chance to outside and enjoy this lovely day and we are going to dive into our recipe that we made today but first we're gonna talk about obviously the skin which is like goes hand in hand with topicals the skin is so important because it is the largest organ of our body so clearly it's important yes and it's important to take care of your skin but it's interesting because our skin is a huge indicator of what is going on internally yes it is so Brooke tell me about what inspired you to make your own balm so as you guys know we do carry a mary's medicinal freeze which is a nice topical and we have our great synergy balm which is awesome I actually broke my foot and I use this around my foot it got great relief from it yeah it's really really nice so one thing that I noticed is that these are our Mary's medicinal CBD and our synergy really relief is a one to one THC CBD I was looking for something that was strictly THC so a high THC bomb so I took it into my own hands to take one of the grassroot RSO syringes and recreate my own bomb so that's what I did oh creative but we thought we would talk about this because we used products that we have here yes to make something that's a little bit more customized you used essential oils used coconut oil the only thing that we don't have which we were talking about you can just get at Whole Foods is beeswax yes and there's no difference between whether you get the pellet fees wax or the chunks of beeswax so either one so let's show the final product tell us how you so I'm give a smell it smells so good I did any tree oil tree yeah cuz so one reason that my bomb is strictly well not strictly but mainly made out of coconut oil and tea tree oil is for its antifungal properties so I suffer from Candida I get it on my back and I get it but it normally flare up in the spring but it's never really something that's to astronomical but I did just have a birthday and went on a sugar overload ship curry whenever a sugar overlays like me for a day weekend it was so fabulous yeah this is one I haven't used yet so you guys it's amazing this won't ruin your clothes no it doesn't ruin my sheets I put it on after the shower or before bed and it doesn't ruin my pajamas doesn't get on my sheets it absorbs really really nicely into the skin so it's because of sort of like how you made it you make sure that it emulsifies properly yeah let it cool yes okay so tell us like step by step so you combined half well this all kind of comes out to half a cup is what you were saying yeah so I feel like it came out to a total all my oils mixed together came out to a half a cup so I did about 1/3 a cup of coconut oil if you have a problem with coconut oil you can always do olive oil or avocado oil we do but we have in the dispensary which is fabulous so I did that I did an ounce of tea tree oil not only for the scent but I also an regime one oh yes I really wanted the antifungal from the tea tree oil so some of the tea tree or I'm sorry some of these scented oils that we have here in the shop are the blood orange the lavender and the peppermint these ones are great for mood boosting and to reduce anxiety so these are fabulous so it depends on what you need like yeah I have to make they don't have to make there's a tea tree nope if you prefer a certain scent if you want to use this before bedtime because we know lavender is a great one to help relax yeah then throw some lavender in there exactly so what's great about this is I had my oils I took everything I did a double boil put everything in there I had my total one ml syringe I did an ounce which is I think half a bottle of one of these guys of my essential oil right and then I did my coconut oil once that all emulsified and became one or I'm sorry that all became one pretty easily because it's all a waste I started to add my beeswax so slowly right yeah do all at one out all at once because you want it to slowly emulsify and become one so beeswax normally it's a one-to-one ratio so if you have a cup of all your oil concoction and then an ounce of beeswax what I had done was because I wanted mine to be more of a balm than like a petroleum jelly right I did double the amount of beeswax so I did two ounces of beeswax for my no no I did one else beeswax for my half a cup of mixture so you can see it's super nice it comes out really nice and it's like a true bomb and it just rubs on nice and there is no psychoactive reaction to this is strictly a topical it's a non edible you put your essential oil in it's it smells really nice and you feel it's not sticky it's just like I love it so it's super simple did it home nice little DIY but along with that yes we're still doing our accessory sales so we're just saying if you don't want to do this process you can really make a tincture in your levo with some clues flour and just make sure to add some essential oils because it's not going to be an ingestible tincture really right so you wouldn't miss for a topic Lori yep you would get your oil all out of this it would take make it a lot easier you're gonna have to DIY everything once your oil comes out you would add yours oh you would add your fees wax find the consistency that you like right let it cool I let this cool for two hours for this guy because it wasn't full all the way but this one I gave a solid sex just to cool all the way before I started using it and I just stored it in the bathroom it's cool Oh dark and yeah it's really good it's really great for Sienna so so this is good for and Brooke talked about how she suffers with Candida but bug bites well yeah but mosquito bites this time higher because you both are those yeah people we are those people here are those people the bugs love us so that's you know obviously uncomfortable you're inflamed when you want to keep eating this will help cool and soothe and reduce that inflammation but eczema athletes yes yes any of those topical you know like dermatitis conditions and I was gonna say that I've been using my balm for a week now and my breakouts on my back have significantly reduced in redness and size and I'm gonna give it a month and see how much balm I have left and see my spots so and keep us posted yeah and those are those Omega six is reacting to the inflammation in my body which is coming out through the skinny it's amazing yeah anything else you want to add today I think that's all we have we have some great products in we still have the accessory sales well xxx yes yes coming in until supplies last we're just

love to talk to you guys I've met some of you guys who saw our first video well my first video yes and it was lovely to meet you all thank you so much bye guys we hope you get outside and enjoy this beautiful day and we will see you soon bye bye [Music]", "nO7vlAP5Mc0": "hey there Jeffrey here Sephora beauty director and Myesha also beauty director and we're so excited to bring you this video because we're here to talk to you about a topic that's definitely been buzz worthy for sure mm-hmm for sure so CBD is something that you have definitely heard about it's used in many different ways but we're here to talk about six very new very exciting products that we have at Sephora that offer this really great ingredient now we've talked about hemp derived products in the past but it's really important to know that this is the first video that we're actually going to be talking about products that actually contain CBD in them and this is full-spectrum CBD so you get maximum benefit and higher quality of the ingredient so you can rest assured that whichever CBD product that you choose because we have many different formulas and we've picked our favorite for sure that you're gonna get the best most soothing calming ingredients mm-hmm now at Sephora we've definitely put together this is kind of our stance on what CBD actually means and basically this is our curated assortment so when you're watching this video keep that in mind hmm so our first product that we have is something that our boss actually really loves is the first time I heard it was from her showed us a Blakely hi so this is the Lord Jones high CBD formula body lotion it's very very potent and it's very targeted so I would suggest putting your normal moisturizer on I love a good josie maran body butter after the shower that works really well for me and then put it on the areas where you feel like you need that targeted sort of soothing calming this also has shea butter in it so it's gonna go on really nicely it's gonna penetrate really deeply and also has a sort of minty feeling to it as well so it kind of helps with the feeling of just kind of like relaxing the skin so body lotion she's deceivingly small but she packs a punch for sure and remember targeted yes great for after a long day you know especially those of us that work on our feet all day and want to just a nice way to relax of my body like scrubbing and lotions and things like that but this is really going to amp it up for sure definitely take it to the next level first up for facial skincare we have from flora and bath this is a new skincare brand to Sephora this is their age adapting CBD serum now this is a beautiful product and I have to say a gorgeous texture I'm obsessed already this sort of very moisturizing like almost like a dry oil texture a wood additional oil because it's not heavy it dissipates in the skin very quickly exact like a truth serum yeah and a long time ago I would say that oil 's were definitely kind of nature's first serum anyway yeah so even though it feels like an oil it definitely has that that serum effect on the skin it's gonna dissipate really quickly and you'll be able to apply other products right on top of me say if your oily probably like I Oh probably just uses by itself but I could totally or something else on top so one of the key benefits of using this product is it's really gonna help to reduce the appearance of redness it helps to clear blemishes so it's really easy to apply you're gonna want to use five to ten drops and you can use this morning and night okay and it's really important for you again to warm it up in the hands and then press it with your fingertips along the face right just softly where you just along the high plains really working it yeah yeah and it's nice like if you want to maybe touch up your makeup cuz they're just going over you have a very very light complexion on it it looks really nice it's more satiny it doesn't look Whaley it's not breaking up anything No so our next one like I said is more of a traditional sort of oil feeling which is really nice this is the herbivore emerald CBD 100 milligram deep moisture glow oil I would say if you hear the words deep moisture it's still for all skin types it's very very lightweight I feel like it's maybe just like slightly more moisturizing than the last one we talked about with a very lightweight serum oil texture it's really really nice just to kind of put on under your makeup over your makeup it's just a really beautiful texture with a nice scent mm-hmm and I love the color I think it's just gonna look a beautiful thing on anybody's fan wait I do my products according to like what looks cute yeah I do hear that Brad you better make it look me over the weekend or company I'm late so definitely really beautiful to have on your vanity it has a nice calming like very light scent it's Jeffrey was saying kind of grounding and I love the way that it smells yeah so if you're maybe an incense person at night or you know you spritz a little perfume or something on this will kind of help you and it won't be overly distracting at all of a scent either so next up we have another powerhouse product and this one's infused with 20 different botanicals which is amazing this is from Saint Jane and this is the luxury beauty serum now this is another kind of lightweight serum oil and another one where we can talk about the packaging for like three years like this is so beautiful DUP now this one's a beautiful kind of golden color so you know that it's gonna be really great for boosting glow and giving that really nice radiance to the skin which we really really like so and this one's also gonna be really great for some age-defy in there because again like what we talked about there's a lot of antioxidant potential behind CBD so having it infused in the product is really going to help to protect your skin from environmental aggressors and stress throughout the day it has a really nice sort of I don't want to say minty but like what is that scent it's really nice it almost wakes you up I think this would be something really nice to wear in the morning or maybe on those days where you just like have had it you just want something to sort of perk you up a little bit but it's really really nice whatever blend is in there with a twenty different botanicals is really working mm-hmm you got the purest of the pure air which is great so our next one is something that's definitely a favorite of mine I'm not he was quite a bit of josie maran products and when I received this in the mail a few weeks ago I literally at my little mail opening station opened it and put it all over me so excited to use this so this is the Josie Maran skin dope argan oil plus 100 milligrams of CBD so argan oil is probably the most popular oil we have it's important has been for a long time like everybody kind of has tried it in one way or another so same benefits as her original argan oil with the omegas and the argan oil kind of giving you that like nice lipid layer it's very very important it comes in many different varieties but this has the CBD added into it so maybe if you're using that but maybe you're using maybe in anti redness serum or something to calm your skin as well and maybe you want to kind of want to use something that's multi-purpose this would be a really great transition for you and I just I find as someone who's very oily I can actually wear this during the day which I only usually wear oils at night and I was just like all for it as soon as I literally laid eyes on it yeah huge man I've been using it with the Jade roller I really yeah I enjoy it you need an automatic Jade roller that you just stick your face and that'd be cool it's a last step I have a product that I'm super excited to try this is from pharmacy and it's called better days ahead now this is gonna be a restorative kind of cushy cream now this texture is ultra addictive because it's ultra lightweight but gives you a deep hydration without a like greasy residue yes yeah it's really great for makeup prep I could see it used before oil would be really nice now this is gonna be infused with CBD as well but then you've also got an adaptogen blend of reishi mushroom you've got purple ginseng in there which are really gonna help to calm environmental stress but I like about it too if maybe you don't want to go the oil route I felt like this was a pretty good assortment of different kinds of weights of moisture too so this is something that you could use if you just like all for it or live in a very dry climate you could layer one of the oils we talked about on top of this one and you'd like to but it's very like cushiony clouds yeah nice like so so nice okay so that's pretty much it hopefully that was a healthy introduction into CBD as an ingredient for you for sure I feel like really experiencing the parts in person is really gonna solidify what you like and what you need to get I find that the consistency really sells me on you know if I'm looking for something for nighttime or daytime and the reason why we said soothing and calming quite a bit is because it's really gonna do something different for everybody so experiencing it is really the only way to know for sure which one you're gonna fall in love with

good night's sleep every Wednesday this month we are investigating the 99 CBD questions you've been asking we'll be digging into the latest research and conducting our own surveys to bring you the answers that clear up your CBD confusion today we dive into one of the biggest claims that I keep hearing about can CBD help your pain investigative journalist mark Ebner Comfort was here with the results the marijuana has been prescribed for pain to the cancer lots of things actually and now CBD which is a compound of cannabis is being touted for pain as well so walk us through these claims because they're all over the place yeah there are a lot of claims that CVD is very effective in treating all kinds of pain from muscle soreness to joint pain to inflammation to all kinds of chronic pain some even take it a step further and say this can help you recover from injury faster and see meeting is described as having certain compounds that will interrupt those pain signals walk through some of these CBD products and there's a lot of opportunities here to help but these CBD products are interestingly diverse we've got ones that you ingest that start with those what's the glory so there are a wide variety of CBD products that you would take orally from tea to candy to good old-fashioned pills but there's also a wide variety of doses so it goes from as low as five milligrams to as high as thirty milligrams and this is a big gray area it's not like acetaminophen where you know exactly how much to take if you have a headache but this you are just guessing and sometimes that with the tinctures I mean they have a drop-off and your demand dramatically changing the dose there's one drop but what does that mean the whole dropper a big drop a little drop it's very confusing all right over here we've got the ones that you apply topical products yeah topical products big segment of the industry and that ranges from creams to bombs to cooling sticks they even have bath bombs that you can throw in the tub and soak in but just like with the oral products there's really a lot of variety in the doses so like the doses the prices are all over the place we have found some projects as low as $8 we found some as much as 150 bucks how can the same products range in that much of but if footballs cost 850 bucks in some cases it is very very expensive here's the thing CBD is not subject to federal regulations remember this is a supplement not a drug so the companies can really charge anything they want that can be marketing it can be hype now in some cases the price does reflect higher quality a company that's using much stricter production standards but not always well this thing's confusing me the most of them of course people want to get the lower priced item because it's more affordable yeah and they're actually often wasting their money so you wanted to test some of the products out so we had this brainstorming we decided we'll just use Mara to test it out well I have a third-party do it we got the kitty pigment right here so what kinds of aches and pains are we gonna cheat on you yeah I was happy to do it because I do have things that bother me so I have lower back pain that's been recurring for years it's from an old sports injury and my knee now has also started bothering me so with my back it's generally after I've been laying or sleeping for too long it's very tense and sometimes after certain workouts join the club I've got both of those BOCES he thought he probably does as well so where I decided to try CBD products for 3 days to see if they would help her with her pain here's her video diary I wanted to find out which CBD products would best help me with my lower back pain I decided to try three products over the course of three days a balm capsules and mouth drops day is day one and I did wake up with some soreness on my lower back which is actually pretty typical I've been laying all night and it just tends to get sore my knee is not bothering me yet that tends to get worse as the day goes on but I'm gonna get started and we'll see how cuz so it's been about an hour and I will say I was super skeptical I didn't expect it to do anything but my back really just feel better it feels really loose it just doesn't have that like tightness and that pain that it had when I woke up it's day two and today I'm trying the capsules I actually do have quite a bit of back pain today because of a workout I did yesterday so it says take one to two capsules twice a day so it's been a few hours since I took the capsules and I'm really glad that it is a weekend because I am definitely feeling a little bit loopy a little bit lightheaded just it feels like I've just had a glass of wine or two classes so I'm getting ready to go to sleep and I'm definitely still feeling a little bit out of it but I just realized I haven't thought about my pain all night state three and today I am trying the drops so these are water soluble and I'm gonna put into my shape this morning as I'm getting ready to mix this I'm realizing the dosing is a little bit of an issue the bottle says use three drops but that's not very scientific the other thing is does not smell good to see how it tastes it tastes like my normal shape so that's a good thing so it's been a few hours since I had my shake and I don't feel anything up

but it is a repetitive one one that can take a toll on your body and your mind many players carry those wounds into retirement one such player is former all-star pitcher David Wells wells invited us to a San Diego home to discuss baseball injuries and how this product extracted from this plant helped cure him from the demons of the diamond 21 seasons 3560 four innings pitched 687 games 249 wins 2 World Series championships when you think back on your prolific career what's the first thing that comes to your mind how the hell did I get here I was plagued with injuries early on Tommy John and 80 I think 84 586 rotator cuff labrum and just go through all those rehabilitations to get better to get to you know the ultimate goal to the big leagues and there was times where I wanted to quit because it was so grueling going through these rehab assignments with all these physical therapists and you know but once you got that opportunity and he saw what it was like the money was good all you had to do is just maintain and be productive and and that's what it did and it led me on to a 21-year journey how many surgeries do you think you sustained over the course of your career point to them on your body I had Tommy John which is covered up now with the zipper with the key so I did that before I even made the big leagues that was you know two-year a couple years after high school on the minor leagues I had Tommy John so a year later actually two years later I compensated for my elbow for my shoulder so in 1986 after the season I had I had rotator and labrum so that happened before the big leagues and through the course of my of my career I've had two back surgeries I've had two knee surgeries and then I had elbow 94 I just had some loose chips taken out of the back of my elbow just from pitching I mean pitching is an unnatural motion as you would expect all those innings all those surgeries led to a lot of pain and just like so many Americans Wells was introduced to painkillers can you tell me the first time you thought about heard about we're inclined to even inquire about painkillers early in my career you know they would give you a smile profane or something like that hair go get them kid as you go through these seasons and as you graduate more and more and more understanding then you have your first surgery okay then when you come out of the operating table to the recovery room and you wake up and then when that wears off you're like wow and I recall that and in what year was at 1986 when I had my first shoulder surgery and I was screaming at the top of my lungs give me morphine and the nurses wouldn't do it dr. Andrews comes in and says give him some morphine and talk about instant relief it was it was awesome I went back to sleep woke up felt better got on a plane and came back to San Diego were you taking them when you were pitching the night before you were pitching I didn't want to come out of game so I would pop a couple before the game in pitch on and I did that for a long time I would take one or two depending you know the severity of the pain and you know I would pitch on them because it took the pain away and I was able to get through because let me tell you something in 2000 I went 20 games and between the percocets and the cortisone shots that I took that year to keep me on the mound you know 20 is the mecca that's the goal you get 120 games you're doing something and that's like a pitchers dream to win 20 games because normally you're in the hunt for siyoung and that's basically what I did so I started doing that and you know because it just became a part of my life taking these painkillers so when you were taking the percocets how was the feeling the sensation when you were on that drug I felt pretty damn good I mean it got me through pain free when it wears off you just blah you feel your aches and pains so that temptation is there do I take another one I'm pitching at 7:05 and it lasts till you know 10:30 11 o'clock do I need another one you know I've just done my job well after a game usually go out pop another one it wasn't a habit of doing it but I did it quite a bit through my career I'd say probably from 99 on probably 75 80 percent of the time I was on it and then recreational you know depending on we did that week or that weekend I just took the painkillers as needed and then got off of him and that was it until later on in my career 99 when I was you know I had you know just a lot of pains and you know black market stuff you can get because you can't just go to your doctor hey man give me a couple hundred percocets so you know through through friends and all that you you you know where to get them and and that's I'm like wow these are very these are awesome I started taking them as needed you know because I had I can get them touch of a dial boom how many you need I got and then that's that was it for 16 years wells had a steady regimen of vicodin percocet and toradol even continuing use of prescription painkillers after retiring from baseball in 2007 until he was introduced to something that would change his life forever well saw a 60 minute special about something called CBD oil and how it helped a four year old girl overcome chronic seizures his eyes were opened I watched it and I was just really I was like amazed how nobody wants to sell to a four-year-old you know but finally they got her on there these five brothers in Colorado and they got him on so I I called my talked to my buddy Steve I said Steve I said do you know how to get the CBD and he just let them any laughs and he goes I grow it I grow it I said no you don't he goes oh yeah I do I said well I want to try it because I'm tired of the percocets tired of the way I feel feel like crap when I take them Wells began using CBD oil on a regular basis and became such a believer in the therapeutic benefits of the product that he invested in a company called green sticks there are many misconceptions about CBD oil even among the medical community to gain clarity I sat down with dr. Alan Frankel an la-based internist who has spent much of his 37-year career studying the effects of cannabis so what are the facts about CBD one that it's probably over a hundred thousand years old as well as THC this was for sure a medicinal plant it doesn't have the it's not like an opium plant or a coca plant where people get tremendous psychoactivity the natural cannabis plant as it came before the 50s and now we're breeding all those strains back which is a huge part of my work which I love people don't get high they feel good that helps with pain it helps protect the brain the heart it was one of the most protective plants on the planet a lot of athletes get injured have surgeries all the time it's a part of the game what are your thoughts on the traditionally prescribed medicine that these guys get the opioids versus the cannabis that they're not allowed to take and what the benefits would be for an athlete first I'm not saying that opiates are always bad and never indicated in in acute situations they for pain relief they're they're effective the problem is the chronic use so chronic pain or preventing pain or dealing with preventing inflammation is more rational I would argue for CBD on a regular basis frankly for everybody in this room everybody in this building if you're a professional sports person and you're injured I mean it's your family it's money it's your career it's it's everything and once you start down the narcotic path it is never a healthy path because if you get tolerance with narcotics you do not get tolerance with CBD according to dr. Frankel CBD oil can be beneficial in many ways including treating certain cancers seizures anxiety and mood disorders lowering blood glucose and diabetics and pain relief so doctor forgive me if I sound a little crass here but it sounds like the miracle medicine it sounds perfect what's the negative side where's the abuse that can happen with something like this I think the biggest issues with abuse that people talk about all the time are the high schoolers and my personal view is I'm sure there are a very small percentage the US federal government says it's 5% of people who become addicted to cannabis I don't know how many of those people truly become addicted as far as physical addiction because that's difficult with cannabis but if you're not motivated and you're not sure what you want to do and you want to hang around cannabis makes it really easy to do it but every morning you wake up you're totally sober you're not going through withdrawal tell us about the sensation you had when he took the CBD for the first time it was amazing I said am I going to get high because I'm a coach I coach high school baseball so I don't want to go to the park high as a kite I said I need something you know because I'm on my feet all day you know or at least for four or five hours during practice he goes try this twenty minutes later after I did he goes your ID I'm like no I'm the same I said well he goes well take the other when you go home take the other part of it and see how you feel that I took it I had the best night's sleep I've had in years I don't give a crap what people say what they think of me or whatever all you know you're a drag addict I'm not a drug addict I'm living proof that CBD works I got a torn rotator cuff I've been blowing off for three and a half years because I golf every day I go fly fish and I go hunting I'm an outdoorsman and I'm able to get full range of motion by taking CBD just a few times a day Wells recently had a serious rotator cuff surgery and instead of using painkillers is in the past he only used CBD oil to manage his pain after surgery and through the entire rehabilitation process and Wells isn't the only athlete who is pushing for a change and how professional sports handle pain management how do you feel about some professional athletes currently playing today lobbying their leagues to make this legal Eugene Monroe the Baltimore Ravens wrote a letter recently saying that this should be a legal substance to help with pain tolerance and pain management for NFL players for example I'll go on the bandwagon with them because I mean I'm retired athlete I wish I knew about it back when I played because I would have been all over it and I would have took those risks if they tested me in here you got you got marijuana in your system and I'll bring it to them this is what it is dissect it go take it into a lab and see what it's about our government is not given in other countries are there testing it they're doing all this kind of stuff you know our government's not doing anything about it because you know why because they're making almost a billion dollars a year on pharmaceutical you know pills what do you think sports leagues should do with respect to cannabis I think the first thing they should do is stop testing for it I think we have way bigger problems than cannabis number two I would seriously consider putting these athletes typically the ones that have potential head traumas on CBD you don't have to use very much to protect the brain against hits I think sports and cannabis has a very wonderful future and safety I mean we can't knock our brains around and not try something so at the CBD as it's been patented for neural protection and we know it helps healing concussions and so many other disorders why in the world would we not give CBD to our professional athletes a lot of people say if you want to avoid heart disease and heart attacks take aspirin daily is this something that people should be taking on a regular basis the short answer is absolutely yes currently if you're a soldier in Israel and you have a head injury in the battlefield you get CBD on the battlefield if you have a heart attack and you go into emergency room in Jerusalem you get CBD on the way up to the floor if you have a stroke you get CBD up on the way to the floor what did that shown they is a 50% reduction either brain or heart damage I believe 10 years from now coaches and managers will be handing out CBD capsules to their players do you think that the major sports leagues in this country are going to change their drug policy to allow CBD I say no but I hope they research this and understand the value that it can be instead of you know quick fixes which are there they need to open their eyes like I said and and understand what this can do I mean I would rather see a guide take the CVD or take medical marijuana then see a guy taking a painkiller why not do something natural try something different I'm living proof right now that CBD has made a major change in my and I'm you know I'm 53 years old I just turned 53 and I don't want to take those things like I said I'm three and a half years painkiller free that's pretty good", "waCbh8qv8tw": "hey Jimmy here with holistic magnified doing a quick product comparison with our salvation 33 that's a thousand milligrams south this one is a full spectrum this one is only CBD so cannabidiol full spectrum there's over a hundred different cannabinoids in the hemp plant and the marijuana plant we obviously get our self from the hemp plant so we have all those cannabinoids in here that does include the legal trace amounts of THC below 0.3% is what's federally legal so a little story about how I applied these I went ahead and put some on this one on the full-spectrum on my right knee which I had reconstruction surgery on about 20 years ago I put the isolate based on my left knee which I also had a reconstruction surgery but that was only about three years ago so reconstruction on both played about two and a half hours of basketball this morning both of these are infused with the same organic essential oils um organic beeswax as well and they are both the same price sixty five bucks so we're just we're not looking at it from any other comparison except full-spectrum versus isolate after I put them on I would say about 15 minutes afterwards both knees felt really really good no swelling inside I had full range of motion it's now been about an hour my left knee still feels really good which I used the isolate based on but my patella tendon starting to get a little bit a little bit stiff um the the swelling inside my knee is not there but as I said patella tendon is getting a little bit tight my right knee feels phenomenal so that's basically my personal use today lots of variables everyone is different but pop on over to holistic magnified check out we make holistic topicals tinctures herbal inhalers very potent stuff so love to see you", "3H3u7vwoszM": "hi welcome back to reveal cannabis today we're going to talk about how to make our cannabis oil which we made last week on the video link that down below we're gonna talk about how to make this into an awesome healing hopefully pain relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "pG34NT3bw60": "what's up guys it's your girl a Paris here and as you can see by the title down below I'm gonna be telling you what cannabis oil has done to my dry brittle disgustingly cracky skin especially with Canadian weather we get like minus 13 degrees up in here it's super super cold and my dry skin is dry in the summer winter fall spring all season long but wintertime my skin is crazy crazy dry so I always look for new products that can help me add moisture back into my skin during these dry winter months so I've been using cannabis oil aka weed oil aka marijuana oil spread past two weeks now and I just want you guys I want to tell you guys all the dramatic changes that I've seen with my skin and before I even continue I am NOT sponsored by this brand I'm not getting paid to do this video this is all like I bought this product with my money nobody said this to me for free this is for real my dead ass feelings about cannabis oil and the benefits that it does for my super dry skin okay like anyone watching this if you think of dry skin you really don't you don't mean my dry skin is redonkulous okay my face be ashy for no reason and no warning no heads-up no nothing it's just dry it's dry and if your returning viewer of my beauty channel Slade parents this one right here you guys know that I rant and raved about how much I love this right here this is the Tony moly hundred hour cream and this stuff is amazing for my skin like I have no complaints about it but I feel like it works best when I'm going to bed because then when I wake up my skin still hasn't wish'd you're in it because it is a hundred hour cream so it's moisturizing my skin for a literally a hundred hours it feels like so I'm not knocking this whatsoever I just personally in my skin regimen I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up sometimes if I forget to put it on before I go to bed now I love this stuff but it's a cream and I am NOT hugest is hugest a word I don't know I'm not a huge fan of face creams I tried this one out because well I bought it because it said maschino and it's like really cute packaging but I bought this one because I wanted it to like just sit on my vanity look cuter whatever and then one day I was like let me just try it and they loved it but normally I use face oils for everything because my skin is super dry and oil absorbs better into my skin rather than creams although like I said before this cream is amazing but I'm the type of girl that I like to try new things I get bored of products really easily I like to try new methods of things like if I have a cream I want to try the oil if I boil or try and miss like that's just who I am I like to mix things around until I find like something that I'm completely in love with and I want to repurchase for the rest of my life and I think I may have found it in this cannabis oil once again not sponsored I went to Sephora and I was looking through a bunch of cannabis oils that I thought would match my skin and this is the one that I just liked the most like the description of it was very appealing to my skin type because my skin type maybe even dry my skin type is action you know I mean and I said it adds moisture to your skin it has omega-3 fatty acids in it actually omega-3 six and nine fatty acids in it it's organic there's just a lot of beneficial ingredients in this product that made me feel like this is the one that I want to try rather than because there are a lot of other cannabis oils out there that do the same thing but this one just appeal to me a little bit more so I decided to pick this one up for around 48 to 60 dollars something like that and it is the before emerald cannabis sativa have deep moisture glow oil and as you guys can see I'm glowing it's not to believe that I have super dry skin I'm glowing hey so even though it's cannabis oil it's actually made from the hemp of cannabis which does not give you like a THC like you're not gonna get hot you ain't gonna put this on your face and be high as a kite you ain't gonna feel no type of psychedelic effect this is purely the beneficial ingredients for your skin from cannabis that is in this bottle here it's in a beautiful green color as you can see here have to do this because anyone who uses face oils often knows that this is important because if I do this and it's not moving as fast as this is and it's going a little bit slow and muggy that means that it's gonna take forever to absorb in your skin you know what I'm saying it's like a thick consistency you don't like it that's well me anyways firstly I don't like thick consistencies when it comes to well it has to move like water when it moves like water you just know that it's gonna absorb to your skin really quickly so it comes with this dropper applicator and let me just show you really quickly gonna do three drops I want to show you guys how quickly this absorbs into your skin first of all look at it drip look at that it's like water again my face oil lovers understand why I have to show that but if I rub it in for you guys you're gonna see how quickly it absorbs into my skin look at that quick and it's not sticky at all there's no type of stickiness whatsoever it's literally fast absorbing and leaves your skin looking like silk let's do a comparison of this dry ass hand and the ones that I just put the whale on oiled hand regular hand do you guys see that now you know camera trick guys realized look at that crazy and I know a lot of people are curious about the smell it doesn't smell like weed it smells very um fresh it's very smells like lavender almost like it's a very fresh floral scent and the instructions actually tells you to breathe heavily in to help you relax and I truly believe that when I put this oil on and I breathe in I feel like a very relaxing feeling throughout my body not like I'm high but like I'm at a spa and I'm breathing in incense or something it's just a very relaxing calming feeling it's really really nice it feels luxurious and for the money and the way it makes my skin look it's worth it's worth every penny so after using this oil for the past two weeks I have to say I will never go to another face oil ever for the rest of my life and I know I've only been using it for two weeks but within two weeks I can always tell if I like a product because normally if I try a skin product and I've never tried it before I will break out within the next 48 hours I haven't broken out my skin is gleaming it's an amazing base for your makeup before your primer I use this as my moisturizer before my primer it's amazing my skin complexion has been so much more clear and it's like every day that I use it as I wake up I see my skin getting so much more healthier and I haven't changed anything in my skin routine except for this so this is the answer this is the reason why my skin is gleaming the way it's gleaming glowing the way it's glowing look in the way it's looking you know I'm saying I just have to share it with you guys and let you guys know how amazing this product is again not sponsored so you can pick this up at Sephora or you can pick it up at the herbivore website as well I believe fun fact I wanted to bring this to New York with me but I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble cuz it said cannabis sativa on it but I don't think I would have back trouble but yeah the pros of this product is it is not sticky whatsoever it's quickly absorbed into your skin it definitely moisturizes your skin for hours on end it has a relaxing soothing scent to it that really like makes you just feel very calm it has evened out my skin tone you get a good amount of product for the amount of money that you pay and you literally look like you're glowing hello the cons about this product I honestly cannot find not even one corner whatsoever I was sitting here I was thinking I was trying to like figure out what could I possibly say because there has to be something wrong with the product nothing the scent is amazing the dropper is amazing the size is perfect like everything is great I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever so if you have super dry brittle skin I would definitely recommend you try out the herbivore emerald cannabis teeth I have deep moisture glow oil at your local Sephora you could always go to Sephora just in case you guys didn't know you could always go to Sephora and ask them for a sample of this they'll give it to you in a little container try it out for about three days you're gonna see a huge difference and you're definitely gonna want to buy the full bottle of this because I'm not going back to anything else anything else this stuff is absolutely amazing so in two weeks cannabis oil has definitely restored my skin's moisture made a my skin complexion way more even and has me glow into the dog okay we've kind of navalore let me know if you'd ever tried cannabis oil on your skin let me know what kind of skin type you have let me know if you've even heard of

"GUoZnJAZsXQ": "[Music] medical marijuana and Arkansas CBD oil dr. Kate Chandler from cornerstone clinic for women is here to talk about whether they are safe to use while pregnant good morning to you and what I mean this is a topic that I think we have talked about before but some new studies have come out and so if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant you'll want to listen up yes so yeah there was a study that was presented last week and medical meeting and it was printed in the journal American Medical Association so that of course marijuana used in pregnant women is on the rise so you know 10 15 years ago was about 3% now it's about 7% and this was a study done about half a million women so one in 14 reported using it but few of them were saying that their doctors say they should use it but they've used it thinking would help with sleep or nausea things like this so are you surprised now when you have a patient come in that says I use CBD oil or medical or marijuana in general well I mean I guess I say it's hard to be surprised about many things that we see but but I am surprised a lot of women may not know that's not a good idea there's just not enough evidence to say it's safe I think what happens when people know oh it's medical it's approved for medical use now or it's recreation approved for recreational use what is because it's been used for medical things like chronic pain or motor OSes or spasticity doesn't mean it's safe just like you know just because alcohol is legal doesn't mean pregnant women should be drinking alcohol when it's just there's some evidence that it might affect the babies IQ later in life their attention span it does it doesn't allow their brain to develop normally because these THC could be hitting the receptors in the brain that are meant for something else to be hitting them now what about CBD oil a lot of people say well that that's safe right I can use that yeah well in CBD I think it can be a great option because see buddy has a lot of the benefits that marijuana could have like affecting decrease inflammation decreasing pain maybe even maybe decreasing there's some studies studies looking at improving immune system decreasing cancer however it's not been proven to be safe in pregnancy either not with pregnancy or breastfeeding because again we don't know how to expecting the brain development and so we shouldn't be using it in pregnancy or with breastfeeding and there's been to that THC definitely crosses the into the breast milk so yeah I want to do that plus here's the other thing is that CBD is not well regulated so you're very careful of where you pick this up because it might have more THC than you know and the other thing I just this isn't a side note but if somebody is using CBD which again I think there's some positives to it you if you're somebody who might be tested like you have to go through if you are in work that you don't need to be doing anything that might be level in their you yeah you can have very strong issues even though they may say there's none in it there's a lot of don't back up claims that you know but we're gonna back you up if your job says it's been found because well plus you never know if there has been some other uses there anyway I just be very cautious yeah err on the side of caution because these studies are still new but we're seeing an increase in women which surprises me as well yeah I think decimal just want to get the word out that even though it has been approved medical use and it's in some states recreational it's not quite in pregnancy breastfeeding alright thank you doctor Chandler we appreciate you we look forward to your next topic okay", "wPMptF7CaPs": "welcome everyone thank you for joining us for today's webinar the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better outcomes in

presentation over to her hello and thank you for attending my webinar on the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright everybody thank you so much for watching my video if there's anything I can do to help please let Ruth know and I'd be happy to follow up again my name is Tommy cannabis saves lives and that's what it's all about have a great day Thank You Ruth for that informative presentation I'd also like immigrants for making today's educational webcast possible as a final reminder our speaker will follow up with any questions you've submitted via email that's all for now thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time", "ofWRESPXK20": "Hey guys! Welcome to Remedy Review. My\nname is Melena, and today we're gonna be reviewing Naternal CBD oil. Here we\nhave two of Naternal's CBD oils here. In the green is the broad spectrum version,\nand this is the full spectrum in the blue. The broad spectrum is THC free and\nthat's the main difference between these two but we're gonna be focusing a little\nbit more on the full spectrum today just because it's one of my personal\nfavorites. They both, however, contain 40 milligrams\nof CBD in a single milliliter which is super easy to dose with because you can\nsee the dosing guidelines on their dropper so you know exactly how much CBD\nyou're getting in a full one milliliter or half or however much you choose to\ntake. The oil itself is pretty smooth, clear, and easy to take when you put\nunderneath your tongue which I'll do right now... The taste is a little bit earthy and\nnatural, which I don't mind just because I've tried a lot of CBD oils in my day\nbut it is a little harsher for people that haven't taken a lot of hemp\nextracts but it's definitely worth the flavor to get the effects. One of the\ngreat things about Naternal is that they thoroughly lab test all of their\nproducts through third-party labs so you know that you're getting a really high\nquality product no matter whether you're buying a CBD oil, or a topical, or\nanything else from the brand. One of my favorite things about Naternal CBD oil\nis the strength of all of their products. So, this bottle right here contains 1200\nmilligrams in total. They also have something a little less strong which is\n600 milligrams and if you're looking for something with double the strength of\nthis bottle they have a 2400 milligram tincture both available in the broad\nspectrum and the full spectrum versions. These specifically run about 80 to 90\ndollars depending on which one you choose. So, my main takeaways after trying\nNaternal CBD oil for myself is that these products are really great, they really\nwork. You're probably not gonna find anything else on the market that is as\naffordable as these are for the amount of CBD that you're getting. They're also\ntruly high-quality, and have been well tested by the people that work at\nNaternal. I would recommend these products to anyone that wants to give CBD a try,\nor wants to try a new product that's really going to work for them. Yeah, and\nif you're curious to read more CBD reviews you can check out Remedy\nReview.com, or you can look at more videos on our channel!", "3Uar2y6wNL0": "hi guys pepper Pam I am going to be making my warming ginger cayenne salve today we're gonna use the ginger root and use cayenne pepper turmeric I'm using coconut oil as my carrier oil my own beeswax that I cleaned and filtered myself so and I'm going to be using the stove top method the double boiler method so let me get this see so it's gonna here to use one cup of carrier oil which is the I'm using coconut oil you can even use olive oil so let me get this started to put in the pan here okay and I'm going to so you're only going to put in the double boiler the carrier oil and the spices you're not going to add the beeswax until the end so I'm gonna be doing one tablespoon are these the cutest I have a teaspoon convection heat so one teaspoon of cayenne pepper I mean one tablespoon I'm sorry one tablespoon fix this [Music] so one tablespoon of cayenne one tablespoon of ginger root powder one tablespoon of turmeric and then you're gonna put this over a double boiler and you're gonna let it go for about a half hour 30 minutes to 40 minutes about a half hour or so okay so I have everything in the pan I'm gonna put it over the double boiler um you can let this go up to an hour the lower and the slower it brings out more of the wonderful medicinals in the spices so I'm gonna let this sit here and i'ma let it melt and we'll be back okay so this has been going about 45 minutes see that that's the part you're gonna want to get out in the cheesecloth I don't have a cheesecloth but what I do use is a white cotton flour sack you put this down put some clips on here to hold it [Music] then you're gonna rinse this pan out because this is the pan you're gonna now put it up on the stove and you're going to put the beeswax in it [Music] okay so let's see here so this is this is dripping pretty well so I'm gonna just squeeze this out carefully sorry about that sorry sorry sorry ok so I got it all out sorry about the camera falling over so all the spices are inside this now you also can make a second batch with these same spices if you want to set that over there how clear that is now so now I'm going to be adding actually I didn't need to clean that pan out I used another one oh I wasn't thinking okay so this is gonna go on the stove in the double boiler and add the quarter cup of beeswax now you don't have to add the beeswax you can just keep this in a jar and decide what you want to do with it later it's alright it's fine you know you know you're just adding the beeswax to make your bone your hands okay so after you cut it all out you just put that you don't have to put the beeswax in if you don't want to just keep it as massage oil if you want to if it works very good as a on the spot treatment and you can even put it in a roll-on so then in the double boiler they're going to put the beeswax and the infused oil and you're gonna let it melt and you can even add essential oils to it but then after it melts then you're going to be putting it in your jars your right back okay so I wanted to show you what the spices look like I guess I did squeeze all the water out see how powdery it is that's what you're gonna straight yeah wring out of the cheesecloth or your rag or whatever you use okay all the beasts wax is melted I [Music] brought an extra jar out just in case now this doesn't have to be at the you can fill it to the top or pay close to the top if you want perfect okay that's it so this is my ginger cayenne salve you use this when you have aches and pains let me tell you the recipe again really quick actually let me show it to you well you can't see that I'll hold it up here that's all you need right there you first have to make the infusion and that's the part where I use the coconut oil and I did the double boiler method so if you didn't get all this I'm going to also put it in the comment section of the video so all you do I don't need that now we just let it cool it's kind of hardened you'll just be able to dig it out and rub it on your hands if you if you have arthritis if you have a pulled muscle anything like that so we'll let it cool before put the lid on and we will be back when it's harden okay there it is beautiful beautiful beautiful and the reason I put them in the matching size jars I'm taking these to the fair so I'll be looking for a blue ribbon on this one so when you go to use it say you strained your knee you have a backache you have arthritis in your hands you're just gonna you know get some out and you're gonna put it on your hand just like you would your regular lotion make sure you label your jar date it and put what it is and these make awesome Christmas gifts or you know Get Well gifts anything like that people that you know in your life and have arthritis or you know aches and pains that's just perfect for them so I'm gonna put the recipe in the comment section you can also google the cayenne SAFF there's different variations of it you can also add essential oil with this I don't do that I just let the cayenne and the turmeric and the ginger do what they're supposed to do so anyway any questions put them in the comments prep em out have a cool day", "giyL2gRmFTA": "hey guys I've been experimenting with CBD oil for a little over a month now to help manage my chronic pain my chronic pain is due to almost 40 years now with thoracic outlet syndrome or TOS and also I had three back surgeries including a recent two level spinal fusion lumbar spinal fusion about 19 months ago now so still kind of having problems with that now what I have found is taking the CBD oil doesn't really give me much pain relief it relaxes me but I haven't noticed much pain relief really so it really wasn't gonna even you know keep taking it wasn't gonna buy anymore but in the comments some people said well really for inflammation and stuff sometimes it takes longer maybe a couple of months you know to start really feeling you know the benefits of it so I did go back and and buy another bottle a little bit frustrated because this first bottle I bought was this cost me $38 and it's a one ounce bottle this is a twenty to one ratio CBD to THC and this bottle cost $50 and it's half the print that's like half an ounce bottle this one is 18 to 1 so they were out of this one I'm just going to get the same one because I'm used to it I kind of had the dosage down and everything but this was all they had so I decided to try that so it was a little more expensive and I'm not quite sure how much to take and all that so I'm kind of a little frustrated with the whole thing it's like nothing can ever just be simple but I guess since it's a maybe it's not it's diluted down I don't know so maybe I won't have to take it take as much I mean that's the bottle seems pretty small for fifty dollars but I guess you know I'll try it see what happens you know over you know the next month or so now I have also started smoking the medical marijuana some tea I used to do that in the afternoons I don't really like to smoke much in the morning because it makes me more Dani so what I'll do is take you know some of that a couple of droppers of that in the morning sort of been doing and then in the afternoon I'll smoke some and smoking it works better I think than that it relaxes me a lot better and it does help me kind of relax and kind of Zone in on where I'm tight and you know where I need to stretch or massage my muscles or sometimes I do vacuum cupping so sometimes I'll do some of that but I do think that smoking it is helpful especially before you know I do like mobility exercises or stretching and things like that so so far I'm not really Holland that impressed with the CBD oil but I figured I would give it another month and see if I can notice any difference now I I was pretty frustrated a couple of weeks ago I did have a yeah a pretty bad flare-up of my lower back and legs but then a compound fairly quickly maybe four or five days instead of like sometimes a month it takes to calm down I think it just wasn't as bad a flare sometimes but I started thinking well maybe the CBD oil is you know helping that I don't really know so I I figured I'd give it another month and see what I think so after I've used it another month I'm making it on video and that you guys know what I think and if you guys have any you know opinions or you know you used it and you have any suggestions let me know as well watching it [Music] I don't know laughs sounds like a hot boat kunchu song hey really happy until the sky starts driving maybe I just pain", "YsncNfHyKBg": "all right you guys well I am Christine Howerton I'm Claire boys and we are two of the co-hosts of the podcast selfie which is all about self-care and we are about to do something we've been wanting to do for a long time for a long time um and we're going to it you know sacrifice and do this very difficult task of trying to earn a million different products no children are home while you watch that well okay first of all let's dispel any myths about CVD yes um you can CVD does not necessarily have THC in it correct so we're going to be doing two videos for you the video that you are watching will be all CVD products with zero THC correct meaning no high they are legal yes in every state and they can be given to they can be they can be given we have a product for pets and I mean taco talked a bit about why you use CBD because I know you're an avid I use I am too or everything um th the and non THC right for the non THC I have a house full of athletes who are getting hurt all the time and so we use a lot of bombs a lot of topical bombs a lot of lotions with CBD in it and then also almost all of my kids everyday ingest CBD all but one I just um helps with sleep helps with just like overall vitality yep and you know some of us struggle with attention issues and so on that helps a lot to you yes and so even my youngest son he loves it he has a taste for it like he really likes the taste of it and I don't have to bother him about it anymore he does in our zone yeah and I have been using CBD for about three months I have anxiety and insomnia I find it to be incredibly helpful now I'm like Claire and like I said we're going to do a second video on CVD products that also contain THC which is the active kind of psychoactive ingredient yes I'm like clear I don't like - yeah and some people with anxiety just don't do well with it it makes me Rossetti worse right actually does increase anxiety and my insomnia so we are gonna do a separate video on THC but this video is for those of you interested in CBD without any of us psychoactive stuff and we're going to show we the reason we did this as a video as opposed to just as the podcast is that we really wanted to be able to show all of the different there's so much out there chance for oh my child I mean like being a consumer going to the store you've no idea where to start right and so hopefully after we finish this video you'll have a little bit better idea of like some brands that you can trust and that we've tried and that laughter just thought or whatever okay well let's start we're gonna start with skincare yes and then we're going to move up into we're gonna talk about oils we're going to talk about so we're going to talk about topicals and then we're going to talk about ingestible where you're taking it you know kind of as a supplement so least we found them okay you talked about this one I'll talk about this one okay so CBD body butter a big fan actually I'm gonna show you any kind of like lotion or topical with CBD in it I really love I'm super vascular yeah and my skin is either always inflamed itchy I'm having some kind of allergy so I use a product with CBD and all my lotions and dips really helps me this has a ton of CBD this is 400 milligrams receptor is a really quality CBD company a lot of any reviews is of you know that is like a really good amount you'll find varying strengths of CBD in different products they should be putting it right on the front and that is a very generous amount of CBD in there look how much is in here it like you'd have to yeah it would take me a long time to use this it's really really really really thick mm-hmm emollient and going into like the winter months we're already so dry yet and cracking I like this so that's 400 milligrams that's a pretty serious yeah right here's another one this is from koi-koi as a is a CVD product line that I really like we're gonna talk about one of their oils in a minute they have CBD and THC products but this one this healing balm is only 45 milligrams so this one's a little lighter but this is a really sick ball yes so if you have like I do eczema or any of their other types of issues this is a really amoliant balm yeah that and I actually use this one a lot and the smell it's like a kind of them really ball smell it's like the a really faint faint like tiger balm almost yes I really like this too great for elbows alright let's talk about base products excuse my pan this is my favorite okay you love that one so you talk about that one okay so a few months ago we interviewed Bridget and Lee from King harvest and they are a local company to us and they have been doing their tint chores and they had also been doing their flower and had been asked to do a skincare line yeah and they created an incredible CBD oil I use this every single day I'm obsessed with it I use it in my shampoo and my conditioner as well I do get really loyal to products you do until until I find something else to ever get up it's like I will use this forever until I don't yeah but how to hold it in it has avocado oil in it and I actually am prone to breaking out yeah and I don't have that experience at all and I use this after I'm micro needled ooh so right after it is micro needling I had it like I can't even believe how much faster I recovered using this that time I believe it so I love that there's also another product that's similar well okay this one is Sol Sol stands for strains of life they again are very well rounded CBD branding a lot of different products but this one is collagen retinol revitalizing creams so if you are a retinol fan like right now I did not know that I've got CBD and retinol in one contact so this is more of like your nighttime serum but they also have a really nice toner I like that because that's I'd get into I get confused a little bit and I went to school I'm an esthetician guys and I still get confused when do you do the retinol versus the CBD because it's like you took the baby D first and then right this is really nice so that you dip you don't you just use one product yeah yeah so that's that's also strengths of life that's a toner good this smells incredible this smells like you're at a day spa and someone has got you like uncover water okay speaking of smelling incredible this is my very favorite CBD CBD bath bombs that is like the gift this year I feel like is the gift in fact I just want to give this to everyone I have its plant-based this one's 50 milligrams oh um that's a good back yeah right that's a nice bath this is from a brand called life elements it smells really good they're so cute I'd spectrum have to write CDs yeah super cute and like in the front I think there's like a little bit of a flower avenger' yeah so that's a nice one and then some other fun smelling products I like these is it kind of reminds of like you know the essential oil companies they have like the ruler yep balls for the different things so these have a little bit of CBD in them but even if they didn't I just really liked them this one's called go with the flow and it's just a roll-on this one is supposed to be for when you have your period so okay you don't hope we can get it just I don't know it smells like a spa I like that one this one is a little bit more intense and to get a grip well is that the blue one yes yes this one has blue tansy in it oh that's really just for the face it is yeah it's really good for your skin when I put it on you can actually kind of like see it's a little bit dark and this company is called plant juice so all of their stuff has like a little bit of CBD in it and then all of their stuff they have a bunch of different formulations you can get as a rollerball or as a spray that I like that so I love this one this one's called chill out and you know I just spray this on myself all day long I've already tried this on me twice today so much it's not like a day spa okay I think that's all on our like topical topical okay so now we're going to talk about in yes what's the word well t-shirt think there's been a lot of discussion about how we say this word t-shirt is how do you say it I always wanted Tincher Tincher I don't know and I say tank shirt I was wrong yeah I don't know or oil drops oil drops okay so oil is the preferred carrier method yeah what CBD I don't actually know the science behind that do you why is it always it might be because it's the easiest absorbed well also it's it's yeah because then it goes through your saliva instead of going through your stomach and bloods and then also I think just getting absorbed into the skin - yeah I don't know we don't know this - we're just gonna talk about all these different ones okay so we have another interested in this one's so coy is a really really good brand they are well known this is one of their oils or tinctures so the way that you use a tincture is that you would fill the dropper up now your measurements on CBD that's a personal thing and you're gonna have to try different things so you're measuring not only how many milligrams are in a serving but then how much you're serving your such time if that makes sense so koi has a lot of different milligram like increments but this one's a thousand which is pretty generous I think there's another one that was 500 mm-hmm that is that's a probably well actually let's look at all the ones we have because I'm actually kind of curious like what's what the top of the I think you're right don't say it quite as clearly I feel like when you're doing these are 500 so is the Florida this one's a thousand I feel like when they don't say how much is in there it's not as good of a brandy yeah like it's almost like not I'm just totally afraid but you know when you go to the store like Ross or Marshalls and there's an essential oils in that area they're not really essential oils totally so I feel like it's in that realm okay so the - of all the textures we have the two that are a thousand milligrams our feels which you've talked about we talked about before and I like and coy so I'm going to do a tiny little tested this one what is it labor orange yeah this one's flavored so you can get CBD oil flavored or not flavored I personally think CBD oil tastes kind of nasty yeah it tastes like marijuana smells if anyone remembers me in college and accidentally drinking like the bong water or like the like rogue string I think you know I'm talking about yes I would imagine Oh at least one time no I actually didn't um but okay so I'm gonna try this one for us okay oh but was it good you know what having a little flavor makes a huge tip I think so because that's good that's actually I was there I saw it was like strawberry milkshake to that they have boys super smart again these do not have THC in them no one's getting high they're not being marketed to children this is really good yeah he's kind like a creamsicle it does feels is also a really nice rant and one thing I like about feels if you're interested in trying CBD is they they have this thing that's called a flight where you can order three different strengths of CBD so smart and try it all at once now I just tested that I taste tested it with a tiny little drop but I would recommend if you're trying CBD I would recommend starting with 500 milligrams so again with this one then you'd fill it to halfway up yes I get 500 and some of them have I don't know if the coin did that some of them have like markers on them so that you can you can kind of [ __ ] I'll show you one that has the markers on it I think I think this one does yeah for you yes you can see how much it's not like a baby medicine dropper early so let me talk about this company - I really like foria products a lot this is their taunt they call it a tonic but it's 500 milligrams and again it's you know you just want to make sure that it's broad-spectrum TV that it's tested that you know exact test you guys really important the testings really important there's a lot of brands where like feels their stuff comes with a QR code and so you can look at that exact batch and the testing that was done on that exact bag and I think states state regulation is different yes but a lot of companies especially companies that I've used that I trust on our website you can go to their web and they'll be fully transparent with all their tested everything yeah and they'll list the toxicity amount for every yes so making sure that they're being transparent that's kind of will give you the go-ahead to try the product I think for you personally is a nice product starter pod for beginners it's a very light oil you can see um it doesn't have as much of the taste in it water in the soil I don't know you know the MCT om CT oil which hey so clear what it feels dosa which that's supposed to have some synergistic like that's really light don't you think that much not as much and it kind of would be something I would take at night yeah that's a good night time is taste I feel like that's what the thing but okay this isn't oily this is actually not for humans this is for pets it's called hemp pets CB do old eyes prude incredible things about people giving their animal something you dropped oh yeah I don't know I'm not one of those people BAM okay so these two products are from a company called CBD essence and they also have flavored mouth drops so they have these this one's not but they have a cinnamon flavor okay it's very you know again very similar sublingual this is 600 milligrams 600 milligrams so that's a nice in-between but this one is interesting it's it's a lot darker than the other and you're going to see different like variation yes and it depends on where the CBD is derived from to have versus cannabis flower so you're gonna be variations in the color too this one has a little bit of it's like a sweet flavor a minute to see that's that's smart they give yes sometimes and again like it depends on the batching home in the batches but sometimes you can get a very very earthy that's pretty enough though I will say it has this little sweetness to it but it definitely tastes like weed it sure does but it is sweet it is is it a wheatgrass shot it really does make a wheatgrass shot okay I like this this company it's called movement lesson because they have different yes coach um they have different formulations for different things wrest control release I'd also like their packaging Oh ID yeah it's super cute and so um there's is CBD with with an essential oils 500 milligram tinctures but it has essential oils that are supposed to partner for whatever it is the issue that you're dealing with so I feel like a lot of people when they first start maybe start with these with the essential oil mix I think so too a girlfriend of ours that was kind of how she chipped her doing the water turn on the water with these oh and this one's nice because the the dropper also has the like you know then measuring now I'm just putting little drops in my mouth because I don't want to I'm not doing full squeezing huh these have a carrier oil of mcg also that's nice there's like lavender I don't know that it's lavender but tastes a little spa you slap the QR codes - yeah so I would sure not even if those are the brand yeah nice and feels just that one as well this one is movement lesson rest okay it Nance it's hard to beat that koi I feels really I I'm gonna say taste wise the coins women it really does make up one word it I know you do I have to say CBD oil does not taste the best no I think it's smart to have like some kind of I do know some people who like really love it like crave it I did too but I also know people who can't tolerate the oil at all so we're gonna talk about other ways to ingest yes CBD one which is super obvious as soft gels this is these from CBD CB distillery which is a really really good brand this is only thirty milligrams so it's not a ton to me this is the best way to give to children absolutely um so you know it's just a nice little flavor yeah and you can get these in different strengths so I think that's a good way to take CBD now I have to say another way and this is from the same company CB distillery is gonna I like those they're real they're really good this particular one is for night time and so it has a little bit of melatonin in it but they also have same brand CB distillery does them without the melatonin to me this is a really nice thing to take them I mean you'd want to keep them away from your kids because they're good or not yeah well take a little rest to me I know right but though this tastes those tastes really good now try two other ones they kind of taste just like like grass with sugar on top yes those are actually actually tasty of gummies you would not know and here's another option of this this is Green Grove and this what they've done is they've packaged it in a drink but it has caffeine in it too so it's kind of like an energy drink with CBD so this has 75 milligrams of caffeine and twelve point five milligrams of CBD and you just add it to water very smart yeah like a little drink and then there are you know similar to marijuana there are ways that you can smoke CBD which I have to be honest with you I can't quite wrap my mind around that's different I know it's weird to consider that you would smoke marijuana without the psycho annoyed you're all like the work of like hiding it one [ __ ] aligner because who the Frick has a lighter these days and then the smells it's not I'm smell right oh well let me I mean let me let you smell this so this is from island but island premiums who also has the cutest packaging ever oh my gosh seriously super cute packaging and they have a number of different products but this is Island flower CBD it's their strain is called jellyfish okay it has 0.15 percent of THC so really really low yes but take a look at this it's just full-on bud just so you know you're gonna roll that like you would roll a joint but there is no THC in it I just don't I don't know I with you yeah I mean maybe there is some kind of body relaxation I won't say this I will say this if were a person who was addicted to just smoking and in fact let me show you this next product so this is also from Island premiums visit their a pre-roll these are basically CBD cigarettes this to me is brilliant for someone I mean like I have some family members who are just completely addicted to cigarettes yeah and I've tried to get them to switch over to vape and shirts we're finding or not that much look exactly like a cigarette they look exactly like a circuit it's just CBD there's no so if you have that physical habit AHA I know where it's like you yeah ritual there is no nicotine in this yeah so anyway and this is that same strain it's called jellyfish so it's very very low yeah legal level of THC I believe so yeah there's those I can think of a couple people that would love that for Christmas yeah I mean I have not tried these because I'm an asthmatic so I don't do right and also confuses me a little bit are there a filter on there yeah look interesting really it really is just like a cigarette so you filter - they're very cool and then another option is I can get CBD innovate pack yes so this is the company called foria they are one that I really like they have this like nice light tank sure but this is an option to wear this again and I know everyone's kind of like what the heck with vape pens but this does not have nicotine and don't have THC this is completely legal and it is just simply CBD oil and I think this is one of the first ones you tried it's okay yeah it's only one I've ever tried so and you can see it's just like a thick little viscous oil in there and then I don't know should I try it I guess we go to vape on camera you're like a teenager right now but again wit there's no THC in this no Chico it's essentially an essential oil it's really it is yeah I mean so you know woody when you draw it in you just kind of puff and it's the fastest way for you to get yeah any kind of relief yeah and it tastes kind of like have you tried this one it tastes a little bit like vanilla it's really pleasurable mm-hmm a kind of allspice yes yeah yeah I would definitely say if you have a loved one who is it to vaping or sequence this would be very nice because I really didn't off yeah situation I really do think so much about smoking is part of the ritual I you know like the whole whole deal and so I just want to point out - I mean Clara I have been adjusted quite a bit of CBD yes there is you know you don't feel anything no I mean if it's if CBD is working you don't feel anything and we'll make jokes about people being relaxed or taking naps but really you feel nothing no you shouldn't feel anything you shouldn't - no where's almost disappointing if this is not what you were hoping for right I mean I had a friend who tried something with me and then like three minutes later though I don't feel anything I'm like you don't feel anything and the idea is over time it builds up in your body and then that's right you're having the healing from you know the inside out yeah so yeah a number of different products all of them all of the ones that we've spoken about today are very reputable company yes parent with their testing again I can't stress that enough making sure that they're testing their products yep so we will link all of those up on South via podcast calm we are constantly talking about CBD products unselfie which is the podcast I feel like it comes up every day really tell you organically - so if you've never seen any podcast you can find us an apple pod caucus and then we welcome you to watch our next video which is going to be delving into all of the THC included my show", "EHNUBHSmBOk": "my name is Josh my a I'm an audio engineer producer and creative director [Music] I've been a type 1 diabetic for going on 20 years now I was first diagnosed in 1998 over the course of me because being a diabetic I have gotten some nerve pain in my feet that happened about eight years ago and because of that I was prescribed a medicine called gabapentin which is a nerve pain medication and ever since that happened to me I really wanted to find a more herbal and natural way of relieving my nerve pain so I did a little bit of research online looked over hundreds and hundreds of pages and I found out about CBD oil so I went and tried to find the nearest place I could find it and then my friend tagged me in a video a green Lotus hip video actually online and I went to their website they had tons and tons of information more than any other CBD oil I had researched before and I decided to order both the cap gels and the hemp heat cream I use the hip heat cream to deep penetrate into my feet and it's great for a long long day of work while I'm on my feet and running out and then I'll take the cap gels before I go to bed and it kind of it helps me sleep through the pain with me being a type one diabetic it really affects pretty much every aspect of my life wake up I I try to be more than that going through life being more than just a diabetic and persevering through everything that life throws at me and music has been the number one thing that's helped me be more than just a diabetic that might be a part of my life but with with music and being able to get up every day and write it's given me purpose and the fact that I can get up and be on my feet and go in the studio and write a piano part or play play a drum part or a guitar part and be able to make something special like that it gives me purpose you [Music]", "_knJDER3PkE": "True or false. CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin. (crowd cheers) (crowd claps) (bells chime)", "ZaaW9DJ2Fes": "hi everyone welcome back to beauty beyond 40 today we have a very special guest with us serene woo hi and we're going to be talking all things CBD so if you're interested in this topic then keep on watching [Music] [Applause] [Music] so thank you so much for being here serene we're actually filming a tipsy Open Studios in Santa Monica and I have been such a fan of yours for many years as a creator in the community you've just been really inspirational and put out wonderful content so I'm thrilled that you're here as my CBD expert to really shut some light on the topic and answer a lot of these frequently asked questions recreational THC just became legal in California I think like a year ago and there's been an explosion of new products on the market and included in that our CBD products so can you explain the difference between like THC and CBD and like what is it so really quickly I wanted to put this information up on the screen I found this on the herbivore website one of my favorite brands and I thought that this would be really helpful if you want to pause the video and read this or if you want to take a screenshot and read it later it's really helpful to just understand the cannabis plant and all the different pieces and components and how all this works together and it'll be really helpful as a reference point moving forward in this video so now back to the video so THC and CBD are not the same thing they can work together or you can use them separately personally I prefer CBD because there's no high CBD full-spectrum CBD which will have all the benefits that you're looking for which is for pain relief inflammation elide anxiety they'll help with anxiety it can help with depression it can help us so so many things CBD alone can be used for all of these great benefits so to be very specific you want to make sure you're looking for hemp derived CBD full spectrum full spectrum hemp derived CBD has absolutely no risk of getting high no psychoactive properties what actually gets you high is the THC and what someone has told me before is CBD is that thing that it makes you feel better and you don't really are you're not really noticing it yourself personally because you're not high you just feel good and you notice it when you stop taking it yes and that's what I noticed too I'm like why am I feeling so cranky like and I get anxiety things like in my chest and I'll be like why why do I have anxiety this is just so weird and I'm like ATS because I stopped taking my CBD like three days ago and I forget and that's why I know that it works it's because it's not something like you're doing you're not gonna become addicted to it correct it's not notice it when it's missing from your daughter takes a couple days it does like yeah it has to be a couple days and I'll get like really like ornery and late and I'm like why is that it's because I don't have my CBD so that's the biggest i opening moment for me like somebody told me that numb that was like a lightbulb moment I'm like that's actually true you don't realize how much you're suffering until you're not but you won't even notice that you just feel good and then you suck her again and once you get that taste of suffering again you're like what was exactly and I think that's the journey that everybody who's new to CBD needs to go on and see if it impacts you that way as well and that's what everybody that I talked to says serene launched this amazing shop called the art of care and it's my go-to when I'm looking for new products because I know that serene has tried them out that she is really comfortable with the ingredients that it works cuz I know that she's tried it out for a period of time so it's really like got serene stamp of approval and it's where I go to get products and get product recommendations so our pain self I tried a ton of pain salves lotions all these things and I still I'm always trying it because luckily not only because of the shot but because of what I do for a living full time which is I make youtube videos in general so I get a lot of things sent in now our pain solve I was shocked at how well it worked for me personally but more importantly everybody who's tried it will tell me a new way of using it or like this other crazy thing that it saved them from so it's a 500 milligram pain self meaning 500 milligrams of CBD per stick that's probably one of the higher ones you're gonna find on the market especially for that price point it's all natural leaping bunny certified cruelty free it has tumeric in it which is also known anti-inflammatory it has a menthol in it it's all-natural so it's like a peppermint so that helps immediately take down inflammation and cools your skin and there's a lot of other essential oils now the reason work so well is because when they formulated it they included the CBD but what's so cool about CVD is that because we naturally have cannabinoid receptors in our bodies and we're mostly deprived of CBD in general as a population if you mix CBD with any of your supplements any other thing that your body needs or can find relief from it opens your body up to be more receptive to the tumeric - it's like super tumeric super yeah that's really interesting and for women we actually have cannabinoid receptors in our like ovary areas so you deal with menstrual cramps like I did and that's actually how I finally tried CVT menstrual cramps bloating foggy mind like a lot of these things that happened that time of the month CBD mixed with magnesium and B vitamins now my doctor's always say take magnesium take magnesium take B vitamins during that time of the month I did it didn't help with my symptoms what did help was taking a menstrual relief that had the CBD mixed with all of these magnesium and B oh that's so interesting and I was like why does this work so well like because I've taken full-spectrum hemp to try and relieve those symptoms which in theory should still work but not as effective as when mix it with the right ingredients oh that's fascinating CBD is so great because we naturally have cannabinoid receptors in our body we actually have more on our skin than we do internally and women sing which is why for pain it's recommended to not only take it internally but to target treat where you're in pain because then it draws all of the goodness of CBD to the area you're suffering with so I could use for example one of my favorite healing skin balms CBD healing skin bombs by kanika it has manuka honey and CBD in it and I actually really loved aspirin have you heard of this brand it says right on the label THC free so that would be a safe one for me to use it just says CBD they also have a lip balm that I love too so tell me like look at this tell me I'll just do like serene checks my CBD a lot of skin care hair care makeup everything it's gonna say a hemp derived cannabis sativa seed oil oh that's not the same thing well here's the thing there's nothing wrong with cannabis sativa seed oil it's actually really nutritious to the skin and to our bodies you can use it as a carrier oil a lot of our products that we have CBD in will have it as a terrier it's very hydrating it's got a lot of omega fatty acids which is always good you want healthy fats but it's not gonna be anti-inflammatory it's not gonna be pain relief it's not gonna help with anxiety it's not gonna help your cannabinoid receptors like function and bring your body into homeostasis that CBD can do so it's up to you as a consumer to really do your research and get the right product that's right for you and the product that's gonna do what you wanted to do because there can be multiple benefits so if a brand is telling you that it's cannabis sativa seed oil and it is nourishing and hydrating yes it is it's not lying to you but if they start saying it's anti-inflammatory it's full of antioxidants that same as CBD or they try to call it CBD it's not the same thing it's all the same thing okay go look at that so this the other thing is if it does have CBD it will have the milligrams of actual CBD so this is CBD CBD isolate which means it's not the whole plant so full spectrum hug drive sea buddies with a full plant and you're getting all the best what I always look for full-spectrum CBD so that's something that's not on here this is a CBD isolate it's 50 milligrams so I'm assuming it's 50 milligrams within this whole jar yes now there's nothing wrong with a nice lit it can be just as effective if it's a good quality hemp isolate so I wanted to just show you a couple of more products that I have been using that I love and you can tell me serine checks out my CBD and tells me what she thinks one of the brands that I discovered in Denver Colorado is called Apothic Hannah and they have a whole line of CBD infused body creams and this one I love it's the everyday body cream and it has mandarin geranium cedar and cannabis and on the label here it says 12 milligrams those DVDs in here and then it has the 12 milligrams that's like a huge sign usually because if a brand is gonna spend the money and time to put in CBD there they want to they want to advertise they want you to know how many milligrams is in there because I'm not paying $75 for great to Milla yeah because this stuff is not cheap and like this is the everyday that has 12 milligrams they have a product that is paint it's called relief and it has a lot more milligrams on it didn't bring it with me today but I'm looking at the milligrams for an indication of how strong or how effective that CBD is gonna be it can calm your skin down in terms of inflammation and just like any eczema or like any get Scratchy I don't know if I would I think you can't actually use CBD products for eczema so I use it on my hives and it's the only thing our pain self calms down my hives it takes down the itching it takes down the redness and the inflammation and then because of all the other nurture nourishing ingredients it kind of just healed it like I had house right here Wow see buddy's great like you can use it for a lot of things we used it on a bee sting that would not the swelling on this bee sting was insane and it had been a week and then we put on ourselves just like see if it would help be seen was immediately the inflammation just like completely went down within an hour so cool so I wanted to show you guys a product that I discovered through Serena's shop the art of care and it's this mondo CBD and the packaging is just really really beautiful it comes in a little jar like this that you just screw up in the cap and it also has a little travel tin and spoon that you I brought that on the plane with me it's so great so you can I mean the jar is not even that big to begin with but if you want to put them in your pocket or take it traveling it's just really convenient and it smells really amazing it's like vanilla and it's like vanilla almond no I'm going to look like it's really delicious and cow yeah cacao which is so good for inflammation hmm so like you said you mix these ingredients together with the CBD and it's gonna be more effective or a bit more impactful but this stuff tastes amazing you can just take the spoon and put it right under your tongue because it tastes that good or you can mix them in your coffee and your smoothie and this is great like I recommend this to everyone with someone's like you know oh I gotta stop drinking so much wine or I gotta take the edge off I'm like you have to try ma no CBD like it's that good I think it's amazing and why don't you tell me about your experience of why you decided to include this in your store well so I tried out mondo and it was recommended to me by Janet who is the founder and creator of code of harmony sorry they just changed the name code of harmony which is an CBD skincare line she's like you should try some mondo and I was like okay so I started taking CBD for my anxiety first I started taking it for pain I was dealing with a lot of menstrual cramps and a lot of other things and then I threw my back out so I had bought some patches but I'd only ever experienced CBD with THC because I live in LA it's easy to get it was actually harder for me to find straight-up CBD products I think that's true yeah it's hard to find just the separate that works that's not just there to be pretty um so she recommended mondo I tested it out I was incredibly impressed by the taste and I started taking mondo in my coffee and I was just again like what is five milligrams gonna do like generally will take ten milligrams but just five milligrams of mondo is enough for me like it's crazy I don't know hey I don't know how they do that I don't a mixture of the ingredients I think it's I don't know the quality of this five milligrams okay is better than anything I've told trip sometimes I'll even have to cut it down to three or four milligrams cuz it's too strong yeah it's great because I know the last cuz this stuff is not cheap but that's the thing I found so fascinating is usually I'm like ten milligrams and I'm good like I am terrified of flying so I will take CBD on the plane and usually like ten milligrams is a good amount to like get me where I need to be where I'm calm but I don't even need that much of mono that's where I'm saying the quality yeah of these products really do matter and that's also kind of why yeah this is such high quality so if you if like the one takeaway from this video is that if you're looking for a place to get started with CBD I would say mondo CBD from her shop we're not doing any kind of like affiliate deal I can't afford it right so we're not doing to debug this by the way I bought this like this is legit this is not an like your shipping yeah I did I love it because I trust you and I believe yeah and so good so you should just run and check this out and it does sell out so gently so I mean it's very very popular so if it's something that you're interested in get on their email list so if it does sell out you can get reminded when it's available for sale again because I am gonna keep on reordering this I love this like it's for real like I have tried so many different products but this is really just my favorite are there any other products on your site besides the pain sub and the mondo CBD that you might recommend somebody check out is a first-time user well if you're really nervous about anything I we just launched our Wolverine stick which is really nourishing I use it on cuts I use it on burns gaps like anything really and then if you you can even use it as a moisturizer on your face it's a hundred percent clean toxic free and it's like handmade and hand poured so I think that's fifty milligrams of CBD like in the whole stick and then we also have the super pure so if you are trying to just kind of like test out what full spectrum CBD is super pure as a tincture it's the most flavorless we've been able to find before we leave I'm sure you might be wondering can you overdose and can you build up a tolerance because CBD to CBD because a lot of pharmaceuticals a lot of even over-the-counter cuz I built up a tolerance to ibuprofen which is why I was taking nine today yeah with a liver problem not healthy don't do that pharmacist says no but it wasn't working for pain relief and the great thing about CBD is that you cannot build a tolerance and you cannot overdose on it they've done studies where you know they're they're starting cancer patient out cancer patients out like a huge mm yeah 2,000 milligrams mm that's crazy um but that goes to show you right there it's you you can they're starting them on the two thousand milligrams so think about it you guys like this is five milligrams well if you if you ate the whole thing which is 150 milligrams in this jar you know you might get a stomach ache because of the cookie cutter ish but I'm not going to do it I mean I wouldn't want to eat the whole jar no but you'll be fine it's not something I would be worried

think I have the very thing you're looking for what kind of CBD product we have a lot here this is a CBD only dispensary oh you had a car accident and how's your back well I am sorry to hear that um thankfully I think we have the thing that will help you out I would recommend to you a tropical South yes I think that it would work best for you you just apply it to the skin you rub it on smooth it over and it should alleviate some muscle pain that you're experiencing it's an anti-inflammatory CBD is and there is different types that you can get and by the way these are frog song farm items and I have been buying from them for a very long time it is a small family farm located in Oregon um near Woodburn and it is just really great they produce and extract their own hemp and CBD and I recommend you giving these products a try what do you think perfect so and they are free of pesticides which is wonderful so the first product I have here is a tropical South that contains 500 milligrams of CBD this might be a bit strong for you considering that you're not someone who uses CBD very often there is mild side effects if you just take a lot of CBD um it could include drowsiness or a dry mouth a little blood pressure but nothing it's quite uncommon and it's also very mild so just so you know in advance okay so I would recommend this cell for you but instead of the 500 milligram we have a 250 milligram and there's Xie butter inside of this coconut oil Aragon oil sweet almond oil beeswax activation time is 5 minutes oh yes yes um CBD is fine to be used on that so you just have to be aware of the proper dosage and be aware of the weight of your pet so do you have to definitely take that into consideration before applying for the intake yes that is a very common question to non-intoxicating the anti-inflammatory antioxidant rich and supportive plant base so those are important things to keep noted before try I mean it may help with sleep conditions anxiety arthritis neurological health definitely worth a try again I would recommend the 250 for you what do you want to do is take a little bit you don't have to take too much because this is very rich in essential oils comments you just really need a little bit it's actually I might have put a little too much there put some back when you rub on like this we're ever needed yes CVT is legal um it was federally legalized in 2018 but it was partially legal in 2014 so another factory that's why it's such a big thing recently as you can see going to store such as new seasons old foods yeah it's a very common it is the next big thing would you like to try some okay yeah here you go give it a go and let me know what you think okay activation time is five minutes so you will feel it in no time there you go excellent okay so another item that I would love to recommend to you is a tincture it is designed to be held under the tongue before swallowing it's just more effective that way however if the consistency or taste is unbearable you can just put some in your food or drink or whatever you wish to do and yeah that's perfectly fine as well and this is the 750 milligrams CBD so this one's a very potent for your situation and socially being someone who's new to CBD I might recommend the lower dose so there's another tincture that has the last CBD unit and I think that one would work perfectly for you yes so yes it is he concluded free so what you do is you shake this and you fill the dropper you can fill it to the point 75 line and I mean you couldn't really use unless on this if you want you know that's perfectly fine I usually use like this much at the point 5 or the 0.25 and you know just use a little bit do you work in real time I think that tinctures really really do a great job when it comes to insomnia or anxiety I think that it does a wonderful job tackling that problem only said something but I've experienced um I like to take some before I go to sleep I think for your condition and the back pain I would recommend a cell for you there's also one other product that I want to show you it is a new product that just came out it is called - the body balm ultra and it is a different consistency from the south is it dries faster and it has a less greasy ER feel compared to the south and it has a little bit of a scent so if you're someone who isn't a big fan of sense roller to get a sense I would maybe recommend itself and really do that's which you prefer so have some of this tincture if you'd like I'm just gonna set it right over here and the next item here which I mentioned earlier activation time is five minutes this also has 500 milligrams of CBD if the two selves they're called a rabbit um the first one that I showed is 500 milligrams of CBD and the second one has 250 those are the two options you have and I'm the tincture again I have the seven so this one might be a little strong for you right now but I think you can start with the 250 rugged and I think after that this might work really well for you since this is less greasy and it dries a lot faster okay as you can see over here it's it's more liquidy there's more watery type of substance consistency what it does smell really nice it's not too strong you know it's it's much lighter than a perfume it's like a natural essential oil kind of smell which I can handle being someone who is quite sensitive to scents and perfumes and clothes and such so yes that one is pretty great again it's a new items so definitely check it out I'm gonna place this right here give it a little give it a go and yeah do you have any other questions okay perfect and which one would you like to purchase today excellent okay so I will put that in a bag I'm glad you decided to go with me nothing 250 so I think sure I think that you made a great decision yeah do you have to let me know helps me I like to rub this on my tummy from time to time it really helps with my cramps cramping pains are just pains and shadow makes it a lot more manageable and I hope that this really uses up the pain in your back yeah just gonna put some on right now if you want back there I notice you have been putting them on your hands so it only takes five minutes again that's pretty fast and the tincture is pretty fast as well just remember to shake it and put it underneath your tongue or if not you're putting food or um the drink yeah probably a drink like juice yes okay well there you are um I hope you have a lovely day and I will see you next time yes let me know what you think of the Frog song farm products I think that they're fabulous fantastic and they've just really helped me so I hope that they help you too okay goodbye", "red1M6CV614": "[background music] Cody: Hey, ya'll, it's Cody from Sleepopolis. Today, we're taking a look at the 2500 milligram\nCBD oil from American Hemp. The Internet's been buzzing about CBD's positive\nhealth benefits for years now. I was curious? Could it improve my sleep? To find out, I tested American Hemp's oil\nfor two weeks. Ya'll, I thought I knew what it was going\nto feel like, but I was genuinely surprised by the results. Curious to know what they are? Well, then you'd better keep watching. [background music] Cody: American Hemp was founded in 2016 by\na group of CBD enthusiasts who wanted to share the benefits of cannabidiol with the world. Nowadays, the Florida-based company sells\na ton of different CBD products including oils, creams, gel capsules, and even CBD oil\nfor pets. Since I work for a sleep website, I asked\nthe folks at American Hemp to hook me up with the product they thought would lull me to\nsleep the fastest, which is why they hooked me up with the 2500 milligram CBD oil. First things first, what the [beep] is CBD? Well, CBD or cannabidiol is one of 100 different\ncompounds of phytocannabinoids contained within the flower of the cannabis plant, the most\npopular of which is tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Unlike its trippy-dippy sister THC, CBD is\nnot psychoactive. I repeat, CBD does not trigger hallucinations,\nintoxication, or any other stereotypically stony side-effects. Instead, CBD is often contained in oils, creams,\nand lotions to treat everything from joint pain to anxiety, loss of appetite -- and yes,\neven poor sleep. I should also mention that hemp-derived CBD\nis totally legal to buy and consume in all 50 states. Though the studies done into the side-effects\nof CBD are scarce, the research that does exist supports it as a totally safe and well-tolerated\ncompound. A comprehensive study from 2010, which aggregated\ndata from numerous studies, found CBD to be non-toxic and safe up to doses of 1500 milligrams\nper day. A 2017 study, which sought to add information\nto that survey, further found that CBD was not only safe for chronic long-term use, but\nactually had a better side effect profile than other drugs when treating certain medical\nconditions, such as epilepsy and psychotic disorders. American Hemp uses 100 percent natural CBD\nderived from industrial hemp to create its oil. I should also add that all of its products\nare third-party tested, which means that scientists unaffiliated with American Hemp have approved\nthe products for sale and consumption. Now that I've gone over the brand and dug\ninto the ingredients, it's time to talk about my experience with this product. The 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp\nis the brand's highest quality oil and it retails for $140. According to the company, one dropper of this\noil contains about 15 drops or 83 milligrams of active CBD. To use, all you have to do is place the drops\nunder your tongue, hold for 15 seconds, and then swallow. [background music] Cody: If you're familiar with CBD, the number\n83 may have stuck out to you because that is a really high dosage of CBD. Most CBD products on the market, be it gummies\nor cream, usually have between 20 to 40 milligrams per serving. This is a really high dosage. Remember, that if you're less tolerant, or\njust trying CBD out for the first time, you can take half a dropper, or you can take a\nquarter dropper. You don't have to take the full thing. In fact, I encourage you to experiment around\nto find the dosage that's going to right for you. I'm 6 feet tall, 165 pounds and already pretty\nfamiliar with CBD. I went ahead and took the entire dropper each\nnight for two weeks before bed. When I talk about my experience, I'm going\nto break it down into three sections -- falling asleep, staying asleep and the morning after. Before I get into that, I do have one last\nthing to say, which is though my pronunciation of tetrahydrocannabinol [ring sound] is flawless,\nI'm not a doctor. All my thoughts are personal and specific\nto me, and may differ from your own experiences. That being said, if you're trying out CBD\nfor the first time or just looking for a new sleep regime, I highly recommend that you\nconsult with a medical professional before you do so. Let's get into my experience starting with\nwhat it felt like to fall asleep using the American Hemp CBD oil. Falling asleep is a huge problem for me, because\nas soon as my head hits the pillow my mind is racing with a ton of competing thoughts. Whenever, I'm looking at sleep supplements,\nor CBD oil, a really important factor for me is how well does it quiet those thoughts\nand allow me to fall asleep. I've got to say that this oil was fantastic\nat helping me to fall asleep. When I took the drops, I took it as recommended. I put 15 drops under my tongue, held it for\n15 seconds, and then swallowed. Within 10 minutes, I felt totally relaxed. My shoulders were relaxing. My mind was quieting down. The world was in a sort of... [background music] Cody: ...beautiful rosy fuzziness. I felt totally zenned out. I wouldn't say that the oil knocked me out,\nper se, but it got me into a really nice state of relaxation which made it totally easy to\nfall asleep. Staying asleep is another huge problem for\nme. Typically, I'm up every night at 2:00 AM or\n3:00 AM, throwing myself a private dance party in my room, pacing the floors and thinking\nabout all my past regrets. When I'm looking at a supplement, I'm also\nreally curious to see if it's going to help me stay asleep all night long. While the American Hemp oil helped me fall\nasleep, I can't really say that it helped me stay asleep. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I still found that I was waking up in the\nmiddle of the night. If you're like me, and you have a lot issues\nstaying asleep, I'm not sure I would totally recommend this CBD oil for that. Normally, when I take sleep supplements or\nCBD oil, I feel super groggy the next day. I'm really happy to report that the CBD oil\nfrom American Hemp didn't make me feel groggy at all. I woke up feeling clear-eyed and ready to\ngo, which I think is a huge plus for this product. [background music] Cody: Now that we've gone over my entire experience,\nlet's break it down into a few general pros and cons for this product, starting with the\npros. First things first, I love that this is all\nnatural, which makes me feel really good about taking it. I also love that the oil helped me to fall\nasleep super-fast. Within 10 minutes of taking it, my body felt\nreally relaxed. I felt totally zen and ready to sleep. Thirdly, I didn't experience any morning hangovers. I was able to get up and get started with\nmy day. Unfortunately, there are a couple of cons. Number one, the CBD oil is quite expensive. Again, one vial of this costs $140, which\nis a pretty penny. Keep in mind that most CBD oils do cost between\n$140 and $240. It's really more about CBD oil in general\nand not necessarily about this specific product. Number two, it didn't really help me to stay\nasleep at night. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I found that I was waking up in the middle\nof the night most nights. All right, folks, that does it for my review\nof the 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp.

Until next time, happy dreaming.", "SbIxa7HBRMo": "Hades I'm Murray from humble B and me and today we are going to make a really lovely healing herbal hemp and Shea body lotion so this lotion is infused with herbs to really make it extra healing an extra soothing and then it's packed with rich shea butter and nourishing hemp seed oil to really make an awesome lotion for dry unhappy winter skin like all lotions this one is an emulsion of a water part and an oil part and they are multiplied together using an emulsifying wax no you cannot use be flax or bikini wax or soy wax or orange wax I will include a link in the description box below so you can see why not and what will happen if you do they're not emulsifier so that's sort of the short answer there but long answer is watch the video and see me destroy a lotion so our water part is infused with some great herbs some martial arts and calendula some comfrey and some chamomile so those are all awesome healing soothing herbs have really like especially if your skin is maybe a little exam ie a little cracked a little dry just a little peeved so those are all awesome herbs for our water part and we are emulsifying that water part with some lovely vibrant green nourishing hemp seed oil and some really lovely rich shea butter this is actually a great place to use unrefined shea butter because I find that the smokey scent of the shea butter pairs really nicely with the hemp seed oil and then with a little bit of lavender that we're adding at the end before we get started I would like to encourage you not to scale this recipe up too much I made a 200 gram batch on the blog which I'll link to below and this is a 100 grand batch because the water is infused with a bunch of different kind of herbs this one is going to have a reasonably short shelf life compared to other lotions because we're just including a lot of temptation for bacteria and fungus to really like nom on in the form of botanical matter so you've got to include your broad-spectrum preservative and please don't make a gigantic batch of this and plan to keep it around for a really long time 100 grams of lotion is actually like a lot of lotion for one person or two people so keep it to that sort of 100 200 grams batch keep an eye on it and yeah I just make more when you need more okay come on let's get started the first part of this recipe is doing an herbal infusion so I have here a little disposable tea bag that has a drawstring top but you could also use like a metal tea and cheese or some variety I do think if you use the tea ball it would have to be an awfully large one because this is quite a lot of herbs so I'm just going to get that open the bit and we will start this is a 1/2 teaspoon measure and I'm going to be doing half a teaspoon of each calendula camomile's marshmallow root and comfrey pop that in a 250 milliliter beaker here and we're going to add approximately 100 milliliters of water we'll be measuring weighing it out later to get the precise amount for the final product so you can either do a hot infusion or a room-temperature and fusion this is room temperature obviously that water just came right out of the jug I hadn't boiled it and that is to help preserve the long-chain polysaccharides in the marshmallow root now you definitely don't have to do this the first time I did it I didn't and then I posted the recipe and one of my readers sort of said hey you should that are doing a room-temperature infusion so I was like okay so here we are we're trying that but if you have very little patience and want this down ASAP you can use hot water I do it kinda like a cup of tea and but if you're going to do 24 hours make sure you cover this with a piece of cling film so you don't lose a bunch of water see in a day now that our infusion is done we can prepare our water parts Oh God a heat-resistant glass measuring cup here I'm going to pop it on my scale turn it on we're going to weigh out 77 grams of this infused water and then we're going to add two grams or about a teaspoon of colloidal oats and in here I have three grams of vegetable glycerin and then for our oil part we've got eight grams with shea butter ten grams with hemp seed oil and 7 grams of emulsifying wax I'm going to pop the oil ingredients into another heat-resistant glass measuring cup we're going to put each of these into our water bath here which is just a wide flat bottom saute pan that has about an inch inch and a half of water so it's three to five centimetres water in the bottom of it and I'm going to go pop this on the stovetop over medium heat for about half an hour to melt everything through and get everything over here dissolved and then get our two parts to the same temperature once everything has heated through and can remove our little measuring cups from our water bath and set our water bath aside you can see there's still a few clumps of colloidal oatmeal in there but I'm not too concerned about that because this bad boy will definitely take care of them so scrape this in here and this smells old wonderful and herbal or herbal depending on where you live all right fire this up I want to start with short bursts so I was about a minute of blending I never was able to stop pulsing because this is still so thin that it was really as you can see here really working its way quite high up the sides of this measuring cup but as this cools we continues to thicken we will be able to blend it continuously so I'm going to leave this to cool for about 10 minutes and come back and give it another blending in ten minutes and there's a little bit of thickening on the top there but still very water ease you can see and it does still so quite warm to the touch so it blends us for another minute or two and see if we can work up to a constant blend rather than just pulsing you can see that as thickened up quite a lot all of a sudden I'm going to scrape this down a bit so quite warm I'm going to give it another blending and then leave it to cool for a bit longer but you can see it's turning into a lovely lotion right before our eyes okay so this time around I'm going to leave it for 15 minutes since at this point time I am most looking for cooling rather than thickening I'll see you in 15 minutes it's been 15 minutes you can see this is all lovely and thick and gorgeous and we are ready to add our essential oils and our preservative and pop it in our container so for this we'll be using a blend of lavender and eucalyptus globulus there's about 8 drops of lavender essential oil and we'll do about 5 drops of eucalyptus I think that ended up being closer to 7 good steps alright now we need to figure out how much preservative we need to use so to do that we need to figure out how much lotion we made so I'm going to set aside our immersion blender since we don't need that anymore and I'll grab our scale here and our empty water container I'm going to turn the scale on and tare it and then we'll wait the lotion into there now if I've been smart I would have weighed this measuring tub before I put something in it and written that down and then I could have just weighed this and done some subtraction but unfortunately I forgot so this is the way to do it if you forget to forget to wear your measuring cups in the guy go alright so it's about 92 grams so we need to do a little bit of math to figure out exactly how much preservative that is so that's 92 and then we want half a percent so that's times point zero zero five and so that's point four six grams so preservative that's for of course liquid germ all plus which has a recommended usage rate of half a percent for measuring the preservative I'm going to use a smaller scale because it is quite a lot more precise pop that on there and we'll tear it 0.46 point four four close enough the usage rate for this preservative is between 0.1 and 0.5% so that's definitely within that range you can see how little that is screwed that out in there now we are ready to pop this in our jar a little glass jar here a little metal lid all right so as you can see this is really thick I really don't recommend putting this lotion in a pump top bottle I did the first time I made this lotion and I ended up abandoning about half the lotion because it got so thick after a couple weeks that it was sort of you know that Slurpee problem where you can't suck this through the straw because it it's way too thick and dry at the bottom so basically what happens if you put this lotion in a pump top bottle so I would recommend going for a jar instead but there you go you just need some healing herbal hemp and Shea lotion thank you so much for watching please subscribe and check the description box below for the full written recipe and links to everything I used see you next time", "bgf_xhQV_ok": "get smoking marijuana or eating pot edibles you probably won't even notice the newest way

"dBjFJRXboI8": "Marten Carlson: Hey guys, Marten here from\nMattress Clarity. Today, I'm reviewing the Populum Full-Spectrum\nHemp Oil. You've probably seen online a lot of videos,\na lot of articles about CBD oil. I want to talk a little bit about the science\nbehind that. I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "VNfLwCQHFao": "hey how's it going

of company nearly 80% of people say they have trouble sleeping at least once a week well now some people are turning to CBD a compound in cannabis that won't get you high to get some Z's but is it safe does it work here's consumer reporter Marilyn Moritz Steph Davis is a professional mountain climber so she really needs a good night's sleep but like a lot of people Steph was tossing and turning I was just in this phase where I wouldn't fall asleep right away and then I would wake up at like 3:00 in the morning I feel like why am i awake so a friend recommended she try CBD I took him for a couple weeks and then said hey wow you know I've had really good sleeps in this time period CBD or cannabidiol is a compound that is found in both hemp and marijuana and it doesn't make you high it's recently exploded in popularity because of its potential to treat health problems like pain anxiety and perhaps sleep we don't have a ton of research on CBD and insomnia but the research that we have suggests that CBD may reduce a person's anxiety and possibly reduce pain relieving one or both of those could help a person get to sleep and stay as but how do you know if CBD is right for you do you suffer from chronic insomnia before you turn into CBD it's actually time to make an appointment with your physician he or she can help you with a more proven therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy which helps focus on behaviors that can improve your sleep if you still want to try CBD be sure to ask to see the product certificate of analysis that shows how that product performed on Tess and talk to your doctor especially if you take other meds because CBD could interact with them Marylyn more its case at 12 News", "BLqIYyv6Dck": "[Music] hi there welcome to the canvas kitchen with Christmas coming I thought it might be a nice idea to make some CBD infused booboo balm now this is just kind of a homemade type of polysporin works great on little cuts and bruises and the CBD oil will help with the pain and maybe help with a little bit of information as well so this is a nice easy recipe it's an infusion recipe today we're going to use CBD oil you can use CBD bud as well and you can infuse that with the other flowers that we're going to be infusing today so we've got some calendula flowers here and on the bottom we've got some lavender buds as well so we're gonna be infusing those into our mixture and we should make a really nice balm when it's done and we'll pack them in some nice little tins and give them away for Christmas so let's start out with some of our more wet ingredients so this here is a mixture so this is a quarter cup of olive oil get the purest one extra virgin and the best one you can find and also in here is a quarter cup of hemp seed oil so we're gonna add that into our double boiler we're going to get that warming up a little bit we want to get all these oils nice and warm so that bill in a few is really nicely with the flowers that were using today okay so the next thing we need is a half a cup of coconut oil I've melted this down just a little bit so that I can do the proper measurement so we're gonna pop that in as well so if you want to you can actually use some cannabis infused coconut oil for this recipe as well but I didn't do that in this one just because I want to keep it just a straight seaweedy recipe but if you have some cannabis that has some CBD in it that would be fine to use as well there okay so the next thing we need to do is add in four tablespoons of beeswax pellets so this is actually a little third cup measuring cup so if you did a heaping third of a cup you can do that as your measurement as well so we're just gonna pop those in we want to get that all nice and melted perfect there so we're just going to get this stirred around and make sure it's melted and then we're going to add our flour to it okay so we have here third of a cup of dried lavender buds and a third of a cup of calendula flowers dried so there then the calendula flowers are a little bit funny looking but they have a very nice smell to them almost an earthy kind of smell and of course the lavender buds smell beautiful so we're just gonna pop these right in just like that and then we're going to mix them around and get them nice and soaked here we are okay so the next thing we're gonna head in is our dose of a CBD oil I'm using some aurora CBD oil today try and find the highest concentration that you can because we're going to be making a few little contains with this we want to make sure it was a good dose in each little bit that people are going to be using so I've got my dose here and I'm just gonna pour that in I would say depending on your strength of your CBD oil you can use like a tablespoon I would say up to about two tablespoons without ruining your recipe because you don't want it to be too mushy either so the next thing we're going to add in is this tiny tiny little bit and this is beautiful this is ten drops of tea tree essential oil as well you can add a little bit more a little bit less to your liking for that too and then we're gonna add in five drops of lavender essential oil I put in a few more I put probably about equal ten in ten of the tea tree and lavender oil but you can do it however you like the recipe that I use usually calls for about five five drops so we're gonna go back to stirring this again this is melting quite nicely there you go now I don't know if you can see this mixture but you can see that the beeswax pellets are melting in here as well quite nicely so what we're going to do with this is we're just gonna let it go we're gonna let that simmer together on the double boiler for about two hours and then we can run it through a strainer get all the flowers back out again and then we can get it packaged so you're just going to let that go if you want to stir it now and again just to keep things moving you can certainly do that and again if you're using CBD bud you're probably going to want to grind that up a little bit not too powdery because you don't want it to be too sneak through the strainer later on or just break some butt up into little pieces and that works as well so we're going to let that sit and we're just gonna let that simmer I've got my double boiler on the water right now isn't quite too boiling so this will probably heat up a little bit faster once that water is at a boiling point and then we can actually turn the stove down a little bit just so that it simmers make sure too that you continue to check the bottom of your pan just to make sure that you haven't lost too much water you'll want to fill that up again if you need to but we're going to let that go for two hours and then once that's ready to go we're gonna put it into packaging okay welcome back so what we've done is we've had this mixture infusing in our little double boiler I mean it's been going for about two hours it looks like everything's lovely and melted together all the beeswax pellets are also all melted in here so what we're going to do now is we're just going to turn off our heat and then we're going to take this bowl we're going to just pour it through here so I just have a regular strainer and a measuring cup and we're just gonna put a little bit of cheese cloth on top I think that will really help us to get all those seeds out maybe we can pick it up like a little tea bag and squish them on low the other thing you can do is like I said before if you have made your mix and put your herbs in your flour just into a little sachet like this and just tie it off you makes your job a little bit easier as well so we're just gonna take this mixture right off the stove under there there we go okay try not to burn yourself use some oven mitts if he need to here we go okay so we're just gonna pour this right through this cheesecloth through the strainer there we go beautiful so just make sure you've got everything get all those oils out from the bottom of your pan there we go perfect let's put that right up there again for now so you can see all the herbs or all the flowers that we've got here so we want to definitely get all of that goodness into the bottom of our container here so we're just going to take a grab of it just like that Oh I'm just gonna gather that up yeah and then we're just gonna push down I just keep squeezing it when it's cooled off enough you can actually do this with your hands it does cool down fairly quickly so there's still quite a bit of oil in there that we need to get out so we're just going to keep squeezing that through so oh we were left to do now is just poured into some containers so let me just dry my little area here first there you're gonna move this Cup right out of the way so I've got these little tins very easy to use her couple ounces each you can buy them on Amazon I will put the link down below in the description below for you or actually probably on the Canadian wheat forum website we've got a whole recipe section there on the forum and I put all my recipes that I make on this channel up on to the website so you can get get the links there for that so what we're gonna do now is just give these a little pour you can fill them as much or as little as you like these ones have a little bit of a line around the outside edge so I like to just fill them up to that edge / so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna let them sit we're gonna let them get a little bit solid you can actually see just by the cup that it does actually come to temperature to room temperature fairly quickly so I'm gonna heat this up a little bit again and we'll put that into another container and save that for another one but it gives you a general idea of what we're doing here so if you want to fill them up a little bit more you can fill them in like I said is fill is you like because they are gonna get a little bit harder perfect all right so we're just gonna let this sit we're going to let it get to room temperature and then we will check them out and see what you think okay so we have our little containers of our boo boo bomb or it's all back up to warm temperature or to room temperature and it's ready to go so you can see here what it looks like the consistency of it is fairly soft if you like run your hands on it you can feel that it's you know moving some stuff around you can probably dig in there if you want to but basically all you need to do is give a little rub on the top and if you got something sore or a little cut or something you just put it right on there so it works really well um it's a very nice alternative to using anything medicinal in terms of like polysporin or something like that or an antibiotic cream what you can do to add a little bit more properties to it in terms of lasting longer or a healing is a little bit of honey so yeah I've had a teas tablespoon of honey to your mixture that's another nice addition so you can start to take away and add and play around with things as you like I've changed this recipe a few times over the years but this one is my favorite I love the addition of the hemp seed oil and I love the the fact that you can do either see medial or you can use straight bud and both ways works wonderfully so I hope you enjoyed this video thank you again for joining us I'm sure the family members that are getting this and they're stocking this year will be very happy to and if you make it I'm sure your family will love it as well make sure you keep one for yourself if

I'm Val and we are the product reviewers from yoga lifestyles today we are reviewing Vita essentials hemp selves okay so in this video we'll go over what is it what it's not what its uses are for price point and who it might be best for all right so hemp oil you've heard a lot about hemp oil right I have I just I've never used it yes I haven't used it until now I've seen hemp in products like handbags and clothes and basically what my is an extract from the hemp plant and it's been used to treat muscle soreness and help with digestion and a bunch of other really cool things other than clothing so one thing that hemp oil is not is it doesn't have all right so first of all when you think of hemp what's the first thing that comes to your mind full disclosure so the thing is with hemp oil there is no THC in it right so THC is the mind-altering drug that gets you high if you smoke marijuana and there is no THC in hemp oil and in vena's hemp oil as well inside you'll find arnica comfrey ginger and violet infused extra virgin olive oil beeswax camphor grapefruit peel Cypress lavender lavender wild mint Burger moment pen Royal peppermint basil sweet marjoram tur Pence's hemp extract all right so there's an asterisk next to a quite a few of these ingredients and the asterisk means organic all right so if you guys are familiar with bengay or icy hot after I workout I just love slathering it on it's disgusting I would bathe in it if I could I was okay with that until until now but basically it helps soothe your sore muscles by helping with the blood circulation and things like that but it smells awful and there's tons of really gross ingredients in it and a bunch of toxic stuff that you can't pronounce everything in here you can pronounce and I've tried it and it works so with bengay what it does it creates kind of like a cooling sensation this creates almost like a warming sensation and it smells amazing so I you can see I've already used a little bit here but if you just kind of take it on your finger so you just need a little bit a little goes a long way so if you want to smell it it smells awesome it's super moisturizing you can use it on your your elbows your sore muscles like I definitely like to use it on my shoulders and all my lower back too if you have lower back pain this is awesome for that because it really helps soothe and relax the muscles what it does it helps the blood flow increase there's peppermint in there also that helps with blood flow so that the muscle can relax and focus on healing so that's that's what I really love about that and definitely smell the peppermint and it's almost wants to go lip balm ya know it's like a lip balm that has a lip balm consistency and you'll see it's very moisturizing it absorbs right into your skin so it's not like super oily like a lot of the other stuff so that's another reason why I love it in this 2 ounce jar what is our price point what are we looking at for this Val so on Amazon it's currently $24.99 $24.99 awesome alright so who would this hemp self be best for honestly it's great for anyone who's super active goes to the gym a lot maybe you're a runner or if you have lower back pain this really helps soothe and relieve that pain temporarily and also if you're just looking for an all-natural product that will help with that pain relief so if you like bengay or icy hot or any of the other pain relieving lotions but you just you hate the smell it's disgusting this is a great natural alternative for that and you'll see like it's it's not super oily it's moisturizing its pleasant but be sure anytime introduced anything on or into your body to please check with your doctor first so if you guys have anything that you want us to check out or consider

like a daredevil today so man I'm so happy everybody could join me today if you don't know by now my name is Chris today we're getting creative we're going to be making some topical lotions and skin creams today all right so that's a real easy thing that you can do in your magical butter machine and it's a good way to medicate and relieve any sore muscles or aches or pains it's also great just for like a good cool down massage something like that so whoa gotta catch my breath here that dirtbike will get you going a little bit of excitement all you guys watching at home right now share this video for a chance to win a magical butter machine of your very own all right we'll be picking winners today live so that'll be a good time and 420s coming up so we all know there's many ways you can medicate and I hope everybody takes advantages of all the ways that you enjoy but one way that gets kind of overlooked sometimes is topicals and lotions so I wanted to show you how to make something special that you could share with your friends or maybe a loved one who could use it so go ahead and get my magical butter machine out here and today the lotion we're going to be making is just a cocoa shea butter alright it the way that we infused it is we first infused a coconut oil with cannabis ahead of time alright and that's going to be the best way to get those herbs in there so I got a few ingredients here I'm going to show you real quick how to do this so you're going to need some raw shea butter and that's pretty pretty easy to find you can get it out of you know like a health food store or maybe a craft store so and that's a really good base for your lotion the shea butter is so a lot of the lotions that you buy in the store already are you know have shea butter bases so this is something a little secret than me and chef Joey came up with and it's it's like a raw mango butter so it's similar to the shea butter but it's derived from mangoes so today we're making a mango Coco shea butter here and let's not forget the most important part the infused cannabis coconut oil alright so this is a half a cup we're going to add that right into the magical butter machine I made that ahead of time prior to you know starting this recipe so you'll first create your coconut oil in your machine with your herbs and from there you'll get your the rest of your ingredients so I'd love to give away a magical butter machine right now actually so let's do hashtag rub me and B rub me and B and that's a that's a fun one for everyone this is a little bit of vegetable glycerin if you'd like you can take this a step further and infuse your coconut oil with cannabis and also infuse your glycerin today we're just using a base there's no cannabis in the glycerin so we'll add that right in there and then this is a little bit of mango essential oil it's also some terpenes and a couple drops of yellow food dye so that's going to give our shea butter lotion a nice yellow color it's going to be really beautiful so that's it you put all your ingredients in you go ahead and close your machine up let's see here we're going to set it for a hundred and thirty degrees for one hour machine is going to heat up now to that temperature we've selected it's going to mix stir grind and combine all these ingredients so when it comes out everything's going to be thoroughly mixed we'll have a really nice melted oil and what you're going to want to do this is what it looks like when it comes out so this lotion is still warm that's why it's still a liquid and so you're going to want

company we work closely with called true terpenes shout out to my boy out there in Oregon you can locate them on their website but they sell all kinds of terpenes that have been extracted from natural fruits and vegetables and all kinds of plants and terpenes are what give cannabis and also fruits and vegetables their odor aroma and also flavor so we're using mangoes some Mercy terpenes in this mango lotion today so it's pretty cool it's really fun and so let's go right right along here I'm going to keep going and today this is going to be the the Coco shea butter recipe and we've got a couple different ingredients out here so again we're going to use this if you're just joining us my name is Chris I'm here with magical butter I'm showing you guys how to make cannabis infused

for for giving us the feedback we love you and go ahead and put that's a half a cup of infused coconut oil so I infused this coconut oil with cannabis ahead of time in my magical butter machine once you have your infused cannabis coconut oil that's your base ingredient now to infuse these lotions so that's exactly what we're doing here and we're going to add some sunflower lecithin to this recipe and that's just three teaspoons and it's going to help all this stuff bind together get a good mixture there so we try to stay away from the soy lecithin I know you may have read that in our owners manual but lecithin is a great binding agent you just want to make sure you get a good healthy form of it so and then what's up Brenda Bloodworth she says it puts the lotion on the skin hashtag it puts the lotion on the skin that's a lot of fun what a weird movie so let's see what we have here oh yes so this is another essential oil we're using some limonene terpene here mmm that's really good add that right in there natural Terps all of them a lotion and then this here is some vitamin E so they either sell this in liquid form or you may have trouble finding that you're going to probably have to get some like vitamin E capsules bust wide open squirt them right in there but about three capsules worth of vitamin E oil there and that's it you combine everything right into your magical butter machine just like that my hands are still pretty much clean if you get a little bit of this stuff on you just rub it in it feels good feels good so I'm gonna close this sucker up I'm going to

so today I'm going to be talking about one of my favorite things and that's educational skincare facts and we don't smoke weed every day just kidding I'm going to be talking about CBD oil what it is if it's even legal why isn't skincare all that kind of [ __ ] if you've been in touch with the skincare community at all lately you will see that CBD oil in products is huge right now everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon of CBD oil and I kind of want it so you know break it down to you guys tell you what it is what it does for the skin if it's even [ __ ] legal so what is CBD oil CBD oil stands for cannabidiol oil I I think that's how you pronounce it but honestly if you've watched my videos before you know that I can suck at pronunciation so we're just we're just gonna go with that a lot of companies have been coming out with CBD oil in their products like heels than their cannabis oil Peter Thomas Roth and their cannabis serum and mass milk makeup and their cannabis infused mascara all different kinds of products and for me when I saw these products I'm like yeah you know like 420 but like what why is it in this stuff like why so after doing a lot of research into like such confusing realms of science that my brain was not made to understand I'm going to try to break this down as simply as possible so that it's you know not boring as [ __ ] and it could be somewhat informative to you guys now I know for me when I started learning about CBD url I was like wait isn't this the same thing as like hemp and like what's the difference and I came to find out that there's a huge difference so let me first explain the difference between CBD and hemp so basically CBD is a can avoid what is a can't avoid a can't avoid is something that our body naturally creates to help regulate our sleep patterns our mental patterns our skin digestion and even our memory now cannabinoids or CBD can also be found in cannabis plants and although this is kind of a different form from the kinds our body creates when we ingest it or apply it topically we can see a plethora of really good benefits for our skin from studies they found that cannabinoids are really rich in vitamin A C and E which if you don't know what those vitamins are they're really good for anti aging abilities soothing redness getting rid of sun damage basically everything that we you know like what in our skin and even better than that a few studies have shown that there are very little risks when it comes to applying CBD oil topically to the skin now what is hemp hemp is a different ingredient that's also sourced from the cannabis plant but in a different way and I'm not going to go through all the scientific like processes of how that's done because when I was reading about it my eyes like starting to glaze over and I felt like I was actually high while reading it because that stuff is so confusing but and basically has different purposes than that it balances oil production within the skin it Sue's redness and inflammation and it treats atopic dermatitis does this still have good skincare benefits absolutely but they're a little different from CBD oil and the way that I would describe it is that CBD oil is much more concentrated and has many more benefits than hemp oil now to be clear CBD oil is not marijuana okay so you can't like figure out a way to roll this oil in a blunt just being honest although that's an expensive way to smoke some weed I am already watching this video be coming to monetize it's super confusing but basically CBD oil is extracted from hemp another strain of the cannabis plant if you can interpret that I will give you this YouTube videos monetary earnings which are nothing now the big question is CBD oil even legal to have in skincare and honestly the answer is a bit confusing my eyes are so red it's almost like I've been smoking which I haven't been no I haven't been it's the [ __ ] light they're too bright so up until a few months ago CBD oil was technically classified as legal due to like anti medical marijuana laws in a lot of states why was it illegal well it was kind of complicated because hemp oil was legalized but THC was not legalized and CBD oil kind of falls right in the middle because it's extracted from hemp but it also has THC qualities for the skin now the good thing is that a few months ago Trump yes I am actually talking positively about Trump on my channel Buddha thought Donald Trump have made hemp oil legal in all 50 states and the exact words were feds have removed all restrictions on the sale transport or possession of hemp derived products produced in a manner consistent with the law now just this legalized marijuana or a little like THC no but it did present an opportunity for companies to have easier access to putting CBD oil in their products and once this happened everyone can jumped on the bandwagon so overall yes CBD oil at this point is pretty much legal you're not gonna see a lot of legal restrictions because of the legalization of hemp oil so much politics oh my gosh anyway moving on from the politics when it comes to CBD oil and hemp oil there are a lot of like fact versus fiction you know confusion that's there while certain studies have proved the benefits of CBD oil it is such a new thing to the industry and because marijuana was a long time considered like an illegal substance that couldn't be consumed not many studies were done on the potential benefits of the drug itself not drug plant now CBD oil hasn't been approved by the FDA which FDA does not mean everything but it's pretty much the most comprehensive way of proving whether or not including it is safe for us or not so because so few studies have been conducted it's really difficult to like fully trust companies on what they say CBD oil can do for a long time it's been praised as like the [ __ ] like miracle plant of all plants which you know I'm all for it but like jeez some people are going like all out now the benefits that I was speaking of before with CBD oil have been proven in studies but there's a lot of other benefits that companies will claim CBD oil has which aren't technically like a hundred percent proven so when it comes to purchasing CBD oil I would be cautious I think it's good to like try new things and see what works for your skin but also like don't put a hundred percent of your belief into it because we still don't know a lot about the ingredient it's good to be cautious when it comes to skin I hope this is all making sense because honestly when I was learning about all of this I was confused though yeah now for my favorite part my favorite CBD oil products that I have found on the market no I will say because a lot of these products are so brand new I haven't had the opportunity to try them out on my face but judging from the ingredient list and the powerful ingredients that have been included in these products I can kind of tell which ones that I would want to use and which ones I wouldn't want to use but I'm just gonna be going through my favorites in this video because possibly it's gonna be only no negativity needed now my personal favorite products would have to be the herbivore this which well the herbivore emerald oil now the reason is is because this includes a high concentration of CBD oil but it also has beneficial ingredients like ashwagandha which is a mushroom that helps like calm down your skin Wow we are on weed and mushrooms in this video oh my God look at where we're coming as a society and other abductions or mushrooms to help soothe the skin and calm skin down as well as really powerful antioxidant oils I think this part is just such a great example of what powerful soothing ingredients you can put in one single oil for the face in addition to that I am loving the Peter Thomas Roth cannabis oil that they recently just came out with I think that one has great ingredients and I really love that it doesn't have fragrance and just a strong concentration of cannabinoids in the product as more and more products come out I will be sure to do reviews and see what I think of them but for now from what I'm seeing those are my top two favorites as a final stay for all of this I think CBD oil has some potentially great beneficial aspects for the skin and I think it's a good idea to try some out and see how your skin responds to it but I also think it's a good idea to not believe everything that you hear about it to take as much caution for CBD oil products as you would for any other skin care product and just to you know try things out safely anyway that's all I have for this video if you guys liked it please leave a comment down below so that you can share your thoughts on CBD oil and you could win the giveaway if you haven't already be sure to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell so that you can see my videos every single week and I can't

lavender and peace box in the mix the containers about 25 milligrams and so I've been using this specifically for pains in my neck and my lower back where I have scoliosis because these muscles have to put in so much extra energy just to you know keep the bones in place as best as they can while they're not in the place that they should be so I get a lot of pain from that from my muscles being over strained all day and so it's really awesome that I have this because it works very effectively for sore muscles and opening the case you get an instant smell of that beautiful lavender I can smell the elliptic asal ittle bit but the lavenders definitely need the dominant smell here the consistency is like it's very squishy and it has like slight little tiny grains that you can feel and I'm guessing that's from the the phyto cannabinoid hemp extract that you're feeling in there maybe it's the beeswax I don't know but either way it has a nice little texture to it rubbing it into my skin I get an immediate cooling effect and what I like to do is I kind of like to just like massage the muscles that are really sore a little bit with the balm for a while and I like to really like yeah I like to like it massaged my muscles for at least like 5-10 minutes with the bomb and it feels really good and over time you can feel the muscles start to kind of ease up and relax a little bit more they're not as tense and in pain like right now I'm feeling my neck really relaxing I've been sitting at a computer all day so yes my neck is hurting pretty bad from keeping it up all day and yeah this is feeling really great right now and yeah the only thing that I really don't like about the bomb but you'll get it pretty much with any bombs themselves is the oily residue that you get on your hands after you're done but you can just you know wash your hands big easy fix there other than that this stuff is really great for muscle pains and staphon's and I totally recommend this stuff and it's again the CBD infused bomb by Go Green hemp which contains 500 milligrams is CBD the laviticus and lavender thank you for viewing my video and I hope you find it useful in your search of finding that product that works best for you and as always have a wonderful day and our wonderful night whichever you're having right now and keep coming back to CBD reviews.net for more information

Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "140VwSMozfE": "hi everyone thank you for joining me today

is derived from hemp that has less than 0.3 percent THC and chef Theresa is using CBD in healthy snacks starting with sparkling CBD green juice so we're going to start with our fresh spinach a couple handfuls into our coconut water we're going to add half of a lemon and then our little knob of ginger blend and then add your dose of CBD oil if you've been speaking with your doctor on this they may have a certain recommendation that they would recommend for you pour over ice and top with some sparkling water that is delicious see be delicious next CBD kale chips so we have our olive oils lemon mm-hmm a little bit of garlic oh it smells good salt and we will add our CBD extract now we'll get on with breaking up our kale you don't even need a knife we just want to kind of start tearing tear it all up then mix in the vinaigrette and bake at 200 degrees for almost two hours I could eat this whole pan but how high would it I mean how not high would I be finally infuse your own CBD honey for a next-level parfait we've used the tincture there's also this isolate powder which we are going to infuse into some fat and what do you do with it so we will heat this coconut oil up on the stove here in this double boiler and once the coconut oil is in liquid form we'll add in the CBD mix that is that on our parfait yeah for these recipes head on over to the list tv.com CBD oil on the breakdown [Music]", "Dncnf1mNTpA": "so what exactly is in these cbd products mimit uh and i met up at a lab here in los angeles a few weeks ago because we wanted to find out take a look our teams managed to obtain some vials of cbd being sold by several different companies claiming to have our endorsement we send them to dr pedram sullenpoor to be tested at a lab we want to know exactly what is in this alleged cbd it's time to get to the bottom of this dr salampur how are you how are you thank you very much for coming can i show you around we'll follow you fantastic quite a large operation thank you so this is where the testing is done for thc cbd all of the cannabinoids all of the pesticides there are 66 of them that we test for and all of the heavy metals what's really important to remember is that cbd is regulated by the fda for only one drug epidiolex and that's for two rare childhood seizure disorders for everything else it's the wild wild west so you test these things here that aren't regulated and you're looking for what over here so over here we're looking for heavy metals right cadmium arsenic mercury lead pesticides and those things show up in a lot of the cbd products that come through here unfortunately they do because remember hemp is a bioaccumulator so whatever is in the ground gets sucked up into that plant if there's lead in the ground it's going to get sucked up into the plant and whatever gets sucked up into the plant is going to end up in the final product unless it's intentionally taken out what have you found in general we have found pesticides in general we have found heavy metals we have found mycotoxins aspergillus causes aspergilloma in patients that are immune compromised that can wreak havoc some of the people that are seeking this out are already immune compromised then they're especially vulnerable to the heavy metals the pesticides in particular to the fungus that you just mentioned because it grows like these big moth balls in your lungs takes over your breathing ability it can kill you it can burn its weight in the arteries it means horrible death i had no idea you were finding those kinds of elements as well it's just sloppy they're not bothering because they don't care about the people they're just a checkbook they're a credit card yeah they just want their money they don't care about the consequences and when if a consequence arises they're gone i mean they're like trying to sack fog you can't find them they just poof remember testing for this stuff isn't cheap one of these things costs half a million dollars this is the same kind of equipment that tests baby formula so what you're describing costs money and there's a financial incentive if you don't have to to not do it and then they're using our names to validate it fraudulently it doesn't cost them anything to steal our names they don't have to pay you money to test it appropriately it's cash cash cash which is all they're seeing dollar signs when they're talking to people that ask us for advice well when you skip steps and steal names it's easy it's all profit that's right so was there actually cbd at the level that's supposed to be in these products there often is not as much cbd as they purport to put in there because cbd can be very expensive it can cost close to ten thousand dollars a pound for the cbd so you can imagine there's a pretty significant economic disincentive not to put cbd in the product if you don't have to and no one's going to check could you take us through the actual products that we said absolutely sure so we tested a product that came to us from someone that was purporting to have you be their spokesperson but the test that we did on this failed it failed because it is not safe for human consumption under any circumstance it failed because it was too high in its lead content in lead in lead 15 times higher than safe levels 500 times higher than our level of detection okay 15 times higher than safe so this isn't a close call this is highly toxic highly toxic and very dangerous because lead accumulates and again because nobody takes just one of these pills or one droplet this is stuff that people use continuously it's interesting that one of the products that we brought here that tested positive for lead 15 times above acceptable level is called verified verified like we've checked this but we did verify yeah do you have a story or a question for me click the link in the description and tell me what in the world is going on you", "bsR6nU_8UZs": "all right hi guys welcome back to our Channel today we are going to do a tutorial on how to make your own CBD coconut oil in a crock pot and then we're going to show you how to use that to make your own organic CBD dog treats the coconut oil has been asked for a couple times just because it can be used for a number of different things you can use it for baking and cooking like we're gonna do or you can also use it for selves if you have pain and stuff which is really awesome I have made some that I use for cramp cream which is beyond amazing and super helpful you can use it for pretty much anything you want it's a lot cheaper to make it yourself than it is to buy one of those like little tiny containers for like fifty dollars whereas you can buy an ounce and 1/4 of coconut oil which is what we're gonna use today and it creates quite a bit for you that will last a while okay and then we're going to use that to turn it into CBD of coconut oil dog treats that are gonna be all organic these are really handy if your dog is anything like mine and suffers from social anxiety separation anxiety he has a really about habit of chewing out himself when he's anxious we've tried so many different types of medicines and solutions from the vet which just don't help very well so CBD is our next option which is going to be really awesome and a lot healthier than a lot of medications so we're really excited about that as well okay so keep watching you are gonna need a few different things for this video for the coconut oil you would need a crock pot one quart of coconut oil and one ounce of flour and then for your dog treats you're going to do two large sweet potatoes half a cup of coconut flour half a cup of your cvd coconut oil and 1/8 and this created about 24 different sized dog treats so it creates quite a few and you can always freeze the dog treats for later because they don't have any preservatives in them so they aren't gonna stay good for all that long so it's handy to be able to keep them long-term okay so get ready if you want to keep watching and see how we do it alrighty guys we're gonna start out by baking two large sweet potatoes at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes we're then gonna bake our buds just like last time on about 250 just for like 10 or 15 minutes and then we're gonna grind it up in our handy-dandy coffee grinder so that we can put it into our coconut oil all right for this next part you can use any kind of coconut oil we used an already the liquid coconut oil just because it's a little bit easier and then you're gonna put your butt in there and let it sit for 24 hours stir it all up to make sure it's mixed very well you're only gonna want to stir it once or twice while it's sitting in there because the crock pot doesn't need to be stirred as much as the butter did all righty guys just like we did with our butter we are gonna strain that coconut oil through cheesecloth to get all of those chunks out because we do not want any chunks in our food or anything it will not taste good you all righty and then just like we did with our cvd butter tutorial you were going to strain it through the cheesecloth and then squeeze that cheesecloth to get any excess liquid out of there you all righty it's gonna look really dark at first but I promise once we refrigerate it again it will get that beautiful green color that we love already for this next part you're gonna want to mash up your sweet potatoes just like mashed potatoes add all your ingredients together and mix well you're gonna roll it out just like cookie dough and cut out your little doggie treats you want to bank them at 375 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes they're not gonna harden right away so you're gonna want to lay them out until they fully so he wanted to sit on the ottoman and he gets to just but right now good good puppy okay okay sit sit good", "k6jLDPp7dOI": "CBD oil in that like liquid marijuana or\nsomething uh maybe shut take it is it gonna hurt me is it good for me if I am\ngonna take it or do I get a product I can trust\nstick around omegas are all these questions hey guys I'm dr. Bradley faci\nI'm here in Louisiana it's like 40 degrees so naturally I'm completely\noverreacting got my gloves on my puffy jacket got fire going we're\ngood to go thinking about getting some hot\nchocolate later so today we're going to be talking about CBD oil\ncannabidiol oil I think there's a lot of misconceptions about CBD oil out there\nand frankly I was really ignorant about CBD oil until I started looking into it\nthe Mayo Clinic came out with a great review article for clinicians on kind of\nthe latest and greatest studies out there concerning CBD oil and that kind\nof triggered my interest and I wouldn't start listening to podcasts reading\ninformation online and trying to steal it down to a beginner intro 101 video by\nno means am i an expert on CBD oil but I think I can share with you some helpful\ninsights to get you going so the first thing the big question is what is CBD\noil and very basically CBD oil is oil that comes from a cannabis plant now\nwait a second I thought cannabis was marijuana you're right in some sense so\nwhat makes CBD oil not marijuana oil so the cannabis plant cannabis sativa\nspecies has two different kinds it has not get you high kind which is called\nhemp and it has gets you a high kind which is called marijuana there's a\nlegal distinction of the two plants based on how much THC is contained in\nthe plant so if there's less than 0.3 percent THC contained in the cannabis\nplant it's considered a hemp plant if there's greater than 0.3 percent THC\ncontained in the cannabis plant it's considered a marijuana plant so a good\nanalogy for this would be dog breeds so you have a domestic dog it's one species\ndifferent breeds can reproduce with each other and create viable offspring but\nthere's different characteristics within that species that make different breeds although it's all the same species the\nsame with the hemp in the marijuana plant so it's more of a spectrum from\nhemp to marijuana all within the the overarching umbrella of cannabis sativa\nplants so that's gonna be an important distinction because CBD oil usually\ncomes from a hemp plant the idea is you get a lot of the benefits from a\ncannabis plant but without the THC component that is exceedingly high that\nmight give you a psychoactive are high so why do we even care about CBD why do\nwe care about the cannabis plan in general well very basically cannabis and\nthe cannabinoids that are in it interact with the endocannabinoid system in our\nbody so this is a system in our body that are some interrelated processes\nthat govern different aspects of our immune system of pain receptors of our\nmood so if you get these molecules in your body it has some governance over\nthose processes so there are three things that can interact with your\nendocannabinoid system the first thing is you have endogenous or your body\nmakes its own cannabinoids that interact with that system the second is phyto-\ncannabinoids which is a lot of we're going to be talking about here which are\ncannabinoids these molecules that are extracted from plants\nphyto plant cannabinoids so those are molecules that include THC the\npsychoactive component in cannabis plants but also cannabidiol or CBD\nanother type of cannabinoid that doesn't interact with the receptors that get you\nhigh but do a lot of the other things that interact with that endocannabinoid\nsystem the third thing is laboratory derived cannabinoids so these are\nmedical compounds like Marinol that have been regulated by the FDA but also\nstreet drugs like spice which are laboratory synthesized THC that middle\ngroup is really the focus of CBD oil phyto cannabinoids is there any way we\ncan extract this from a cannabis plant put it in some kind of vehicle that\nallows it to get inside the body and hopefully garner some of the positive\nbenefits from the plant so that brings me to my next topic which is CBD oil as\nmedicine well there was a lot of increased interest in 2008\nwhen the FDA approved a pure CBD oil called\na pity elects for a rare form of juvenile seizures our pediatric seizure\ndisorders and they found that this CBD oil in its most purified form could\nactually reduce the amount of seizures these kids were having and so after a\nrigorous trial and rigorous safety studies it was actually approved and now\nthe public interest has kind of peaked to where they're saying hey we should\nlook at this and see what benefits it might provide the current body of\nmedical literature surrounding CBD oil is a little bit sparse but there's more\nand more stuff coming out and right now there's a lot of animal studies looking\nat CBD oil and pain and mood in addiction and I think a lot of stuff is\ngoing to be coming out of the next few years but right now a lot of it is\neither anecdotal like hey I took this and I think it helped with my anxiety or\nI took this and I think it helped my back pain or some smaller scale study so\nin medicine it's kind of a range of how powerful studies are so that can be from\njust a case study like hey this one person took it and felt better - a small\nsample size study of like hey we gave it to ten people and a lot of them felt\nbetter all the way up to the more vigorous randomized controlled trials\nwhere you say let's take CBD oil and compare it to another treatment for pain\nour mood or depression and let's see if it's better or equal to that treatment\nso a lot of those randomized controlled trials were still waiting to come out\nbut we're seeing a lot of small size 10 15 20 people enrolled in these small\ntrials of CBD oil where there's some really interesting outcomes but at this\npoint is a doctor until I see those larger studies I can't really say hey I\nrecommend this to my patients but it's something that is worth looking at and\nkind of putting our feelers out to see what comes out over the next few years\nso I think another question you should be asking is is this stuff safe now the\nbiggest safety study was obviously done with the PD elects the FDA approved CBD\noil but see other forms of CBD have had some smaller scale safety studies and no\nmajor adverse outcomes have really come out of those\nyet a couple of things they have noted is that it can interfere with some of\nyour laboratory tests including your liver function panels and it can also\ninterfere possibly with blood thinners like coumadin our anti-seizure medicines\nit can affect the levels of those in your blood stream okay next topic\nlegality and this is a little bit of an evolving question so in 1970 the\ncontrolled substance act banned marijuana him and all related products\nthey put it under the jurisdiction of the DEA made it in a legal substance it\nwasn't in - until 2014 when an agricultural act was passed also known\nas the farm bill these gloves are also and that legalized hemp for research\npurposes and that was the bill that designated that the hemp plant although\nstill a cannabis plant was legally defined as a plant that had less than\n0.3 percent THC contained in it now in 2018 there was some more progress made\nwhen the 2018 form bill came out and said now him and hemp related products\nlike CBD oil are federally legal so at a national level they've said you can grow\nthis product you can grow hemp plants that have less than 0.3 percent THC and\nyou can start making products from them the tricky part is when we get down to a\nstate level so you need to check your state guidelines because the federal\nregulations still say the states can have governance over their own\njurisdiction Louisiana or I'm from I had to really do some research to figure out\nwhat the exact stipulations are if you plan on buying CBD oil\nI would really get down to the nitty-gritty of what your state says\nright now so you want to roll the dice and try CBD oil okay what do I do what I\ndid I pretended that I was someone that wanted to buy CBD oil from Ground Zero\nnever looked at products and I started researching it online the first thing I\nfound was the FDA did a survey back in when was it 2017 and they randomly\npicked 84 online products and they looked at the labels on the bottle so\noh this product contains 0.1% THC and whatever percent CBD what they found was\nonly 26 of the 84 were labeled correctly the trim was there was more THC than\nthey said was in it and there was less CBD than they said there are even a\ncouple of case studies where kids took it and they were actually intoxicated\nwith the THC from these CBD oils there's been a little more progress since then\nnow that it's regulated by the USDA and it's not a controlled substance anymore\nthere's been some trends and the major trend is that companies that are\nproducing CBD oil are sending their product every batch they make they brew\nit in a big pot that's not really how it works but that's how I imagine in my\nbrain and that batch they send to a lab that's unrelated to the company and they\nsay you test this make sure it doesn't have any impurities in it like heavy\nmetals and make sure it has the amount of CBD we say it does and it has the\namount of THC we say it does or none at all and so a lot of these companies are\nlinking those batch reports on their website or even on the label of their\nbottle it's where you can easily access it and say this is exactly what's in\nthis oil so I'm going to talk about different products now and some of the\nguidelines I think you should follow in picking out a CBD product if you plan on\nbuying some and also what the difference between different products is there are\nthree different types of CBD oil full-spectrum broad spectrum and then\npurified CBD oil so full spectrum is if you take the flower the leaves you\nextract the oil and don't remove anything from it so there's still a\nlittle bit of THC there CBD in it but also there's all the other parts of the\nplant which we broadly classify as a compound called terpenes and there's all\ndifferent types of terpenes so all of that is in the product and the reason\nthat they do that is something called the entourage effect so unlike typical\npharmaceutical medicines that you might get for your diabetes or your blood\npressure but usually have one active ingredient the entourage effect says we\nwant all of the beneficial products within this plant into our product\nbecause there have been some small-scale studies that show the CBD oil works best\nwhen there's a little bit of terpene mixed with it and when there's might be\neven miniscule amounts of THC mixed with it and so someone that wants all of\nthose products from the plant in their oil would be looking for a full spectrum\noil broad spectrum is the entire plant but they remove all of the THC from it\nso it's got 0% THC so that might be important if you really want to make\nsure you don't feel like a drug screen in the in the future if it's completely\nillegal for any THC content in your state then you might want to look for a\nbroad spectrum then the third category is completely purified CBD oil they take\nall the terpenes out of it they take all of the THC out of it and it's just CBD\nso in that product you wouldn't get this entourage effect because it would just\nbe the CBD and a lot of advocates of CBD oil out there really ham up this\nentourage effect and say and you really don't want pure CBD oil but a lot of\nthis is anecdotal a lot of this is not really studied in the scientific\nliterature yet but it will be watch soon here's my list of things you want to\nlook for when buying a CBD oil if you choose to do so number one how is the\noil extracted so there are safer and healthier ways and the best one is\ncalled co2 extraction rather than solvent or ethanol extraction so look\nfor a product that's co2 extracted number two look for a product that has\nbatch testing so they have a lab analysis from a third party source that\nsays exactly what's in the product and has a QR code those little barcodes you\ncan scan with your iPhone to link to that certificate of analysis from the\nlab and that means if you get pulled over and there's this weird bottle of\noil in your car and the police officers like sir that's some weed oil right\nthere and you're like no no no scam this QR code check out the lab analysis it\nactually has zero percent THC in it and I can prove it so you know exactly what\nyou're getting those batch certificates now here's number three something you\nshould look for also show that it doesn't have heavy metals or pesticides\ncontaining the product all these things that you don't want to put in your body\nand for the last part is is it certified by any government regulated agency so is\nit USDA organic certified does it have good manufacturing practices\ncertification so these are some things that now it falls under the USDA and not\nan illegal substance that more and more companies are going to be getting\ncertified with these practices that are approved by the USDA so here we go I\nwent online and try to use all four of those principles I just gave you to find\na product that I might try or tell someone to try remember disclaimer I'm\nnot recommending this product is a doctor there's not enough information\nout there for me to recommend it I'm just saying if someone were gonna try it\nthese would be the products I would look at now I look through hundreds of sites\nI look through all of the about us and about the companies and what they were\ncertified in and what the batches looked like and two of them I boiled it down to\nif I were gonna get a full spectrum oil that had a little bit of THC I would\nprobably use this company called new leaf I'll put a link to it down below\nand also if I were gonna use a broad spectrum that didn't have any THC in it\nthat had batch testing no heavy metals was organic etc etc I think the number\none brand I choose is a brand called joy organics and I'll link that down below\nplease comment below tell me what I messed up in this video let me know what\nproducts you've tried yourself what it's done for you if you've seen benefit I\nwant to hear your stories I want to hear what products you recommend am i\ncompletely off-base let me know thanks this is PostScript I'm dr. Fauci a I've\ngot a puffy jacket and warm gloves oh one last note is it gonna make my drug\nscreen positive I don't know maybe so be careful I would get a no THC 0%\notherwise known as a broad-spectrum CBD oil if you're worried about it because\nit has zero THC that one I'm pretty sure will not make your drug screen positive\nif you get a full spectrum that has miniscule levels of THC in it I think\nyou're rolling the dice forgot to mention that", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "qth69ri7URY": "tonight the debate over veterinary marijuana cannabis to treat health problems in your as Denver sevens Molly Hendrickson shows us this industry is so new there have been no scientific studies to know if it's safe for even works until now meet Tucker the nine-year-old ental booker is well known at CSU for his enthusiastic greetings and affinity for treats there we go he's also one of the dogs dr. Felix Durr and his team hope will give them a better understanding of how effective CBD the non psychoactive cannabis compound found in marijuana plants is in treating arthritis and epilepsy our question is does CBD help with this problem and is there an improvement and all the outcome measures that we use the budding industry promises to treat everything from anxiety to pain management but like anything involving cannabis the legal waters of how the drug is being used remain murky it is to some degree a federal crime right now to prescribe this no there's there's lots of gray zones still many vets already prescribed CBD with a very low THC dose screwing any potential legal consequences regardless pet owners are coming to this Center at CSU hoping to get treatment for their bestfriends the discussion of CBD use in pets is nothing new testimonials from vets appear on the American Veterinary Medical Association website claiming success in treating pain but also the need for Responsible dosing and more research and that's where dr. Drew comes in we need to make sure that there is no problems that can happen when you give this to your dog in Tucker's case so he has right elbow arthritis it went really quickly from limping one day to two months later not wanting to go on any more walks or anything his owner Jackie Tchaikovsky watched arthritis steal parts of his life for the last two years we gave him some Roma dough and some glucosamine and things like that but nothing really worked desperate for a fix she turned to doctor during his team thought it would be worth a try since nothing was working for him he's been treating for three months giving him an oil containing CBD and an oil without it Jackie doesn't know the results of the study yet but already she's a believer yes I'm convinced 100% convinced for him it's working so much so she's continued him on CBD treatment it's a different strength of what he was getting here for the study but he stolen the CBD it's from the same company and and he gets it twice a day every day dr. Dewar and his team are hopeful but say pet owners should remain cautious if considering CBD for their dogs there's not enough information for us to feel confident and say yes that that's great you should give this to your dog Molly hundreds in Denver seven and CSU researchers are also looking at the effects of CBD in treating epilepsy now CBD oil doesn't get your pet high because it ain't contains such a small amount of THC no teeth see it's actually toxic to pets the study's findings will be out in about a year", "IB4Z7_XBopc": "[Music] well I'm standing in a beautiful field with barb Iverson now you usually see barb in us here the spring talking about their wonderful tulip fields however barb you've you've gone down a different path of opening up another part of your business your big business and that is a growing hemp now in my world my mom would have thought this was the bad stuff but it isn't is it no the bad stuff has the highest THC in it that's like the cousin of this is a whole different place this plant has low THC under 0.3 percent THC and high CBD and the CBD is what but people that use it really say it works wonderful on so many medical problems with them and pain right right that's what we're after so you actually then you grow this but it's not like you just got some seeds and throughout here this is really tracked by the state of Oregon it is something that they write and make sure it's right right we have to buy a license from the Oregon Department of Ag and then they monitor the field we pin it where the exact location is the number a KERS and then we have it tested and it has to test below that point three percent THC or we have to destroy the crown I just have to get rid of it so then not only do you grow this and I know I've talked to a lot of people who want to buy it as a medicine type thing is helping with them in some way which not have that really been proven but they still have used it they believe in it so they're concerned about the stuff being healthy you grow this right here in this field we grow it and you then you make it you you do all the processing of it right that's right we chop it down we dry it we and then we make it into an oil well then I think we should leave this beautiful field and go over there and see and find out some more about how you process it how's that sound sounds good wonderful barb come on okay but her so this is a very clean room it is plans this is you've done the harvesting and this is where you bring those harvest oh no first one after we harvest we have to dry the material first game that creates biomass we call biomass and we separate that biomass we take the woody parts out of it then we bring it in here to extract it and these are co2 extractors so you say extract it extract so what's tracked so we extract the plant waxes and cannabinoids out of that dry biomass okay and that this is a process that you have to go through to actually do that it's not just like ringing a minute no no no you go through this process and it's temperature and pressure and then that separates out all the cannabinoids and plant waxes and then is that CBD no no no eh then that's raw well from there we take it into our lab where we refine it further we take it down and and we separate out the plant waxes and purify it a little bit more and then we warm it up to decarboxylated so we're really yeah it's not just a simple process of getting the oil from the plants I mean youth there are so many steps that you have to follow and legally to make sure that it's right that's right wow that's so interesting now after all of this you have some of the the product has been made into different things that you're selling now so let's go to that store and and look and see what ultimately we can get from that that's good all right so now we are in the store which is a barn red barn hemp right right this is still part of a business is all family family a family business and

put it in your coffee or your drink however you like to take it capsules for those that like to take capsules want to know what their dosage is think about our product is we put in how much CBD is in

places to buy this stuff you can guarantee that the information you give about it is right we ever oil tested at a third party lab the same with our final product right right and then what I love about this besides the other products used to set it up out here was you even have them for dogs dogs right right dogs are mammals they have an endocannabinoid system just like us they have the receptors so you have a dog old dog that's having trouble getting around right they work great and then you you have personally had a lot of people actually talk to you guys and say this works for me this I use it stories are amazing oh it just there we do the tulip festival and create memories this this is again quality of life we use it with my dad when he came home with cancer and we had 42 days we felt that we wouldn't have had otherwise when we pulled him up all the narcotics and just had him on the capsules he could talk to us we could take him around the tulip field it was it was an amazing experience and I know it is to it the same thing happened to my mother and I we came out here and I saw this when you started selling it I bought some Chico it worked on her in a Rob with the energy I really was so thankful that you guys stepped in to and sometimes uncomfortable of growing something and then making something beautiful out of it it love that about great and it's been a huge

anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but",

Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like

infused oils you'll need these to make salves and some other soaps and products on your homestead today we're going to go over the infused oils and then I'm going to show you how to make your own healing salve [Music] you so salve ourselves however you say it depends on where you're from but today we're going to go over and paste oils and fast assisted in the beginning and this is a really really easy task something that any homesteader can begin with if you're wanting to get into herbalism this might be the best place for you to begin with making products now I know making products with herbs can be a little bit intimidating but it doesn't have to be so in past videos we've gone over how to make tinctures or salve not fast but infused oils there's a couple different ways to make infused oils but before you can make a fab you to make an infused oil most of the time now there are some stats that we make better just use strictly with essential oils and that's okay you don't have to worry about making and infused oil at that point you just buy the essential oil but today we're actually using calendula chamomile and arnica oil we don't have those in essential oils we have them in infused oils so there are a couple different ways for you to make the infused oil before you make your sad the most commonly popular way that you're going to find online is to fill your jar up with one part herb and five parts oil I just use olive oil you can use fractioned coconut oil grapeseed oil whichever you prefer but I prefer to use olive oil just because it's readily available at all times and so you're going to weigh it out for a one-ounce herb to 5 ounces of oil now this is calendula you can see that the oil does not cover the entire st. part of calendula but you're going to fill your jar up you're going to shake it really well and that's going to sit in a sunny area for about 4 weeks that's just ensure that you get all the best attraction from the oil that's the hard way or the long way to make an infused oil the next way to make an infused oil is to actually put the oil in your oven so what you do is you would set your oven to 300 degrees measure out your herb and your oil and a jar and a glass jar just like this and once your temperature has reached an or degrees you turn your oven off put your jar into the oven to set for two to three hours you're not going to bake or cook the herb you're just wanting the heat to heat up the urban extract it the final way to make an infused oil is to do your same ratio a 1 to 5 ratio 1 ounce or 5 ounces of oil and to put it in a double boiler on your stovetop that takes about 30 minutes to an hour just depending on your herb and how hot it is in your oven so that's the next bit of making the Z's a little 3 easy very easy ways one more time consuming than the other I definitely up for the oven option I actually have herbs in the oven right now that I will show you I've extracted chamomile and arnica this is calendula that I actually had extracting for four weeks in my bathroom cabinet medicine cabinet which gets a lot of sunlight sometimes so I want to put that in there so I'm going to get started and we're going to make a homestead SAP I've gotten my herbs out of the oven this is the kimono oh my gosh chamomile is my favorite herb to extract and oil it smells on - I could eat it now your oils are going to be strained I'm going to go ahead and strain it through a mesh strainer but sometimes for certain herbs they can actually there can slip through the strainer but I'm going to go ahead and try the strainer first and you're going to need to go ahead and separate them into separate jars because I'm actually going to be using these probably more than one time you're just going to go ahead and push down and get all of that oil out now there is some of the flower head that's coming through and that's okay but I may want to go ahead and put it through a mesh towel just one more time just to make sure we get all of that out wisdom soon the the [Music] straining the oil's is probably one of the messiest jobs you have during this entire process so you're going to get dirty make sure you wash your hands after each straining of each oil that way you don't have any contamination and the oil isn't soaking into your skin for a really long time so now that you've made and strained your infused oils now you're going to want to make a salve or some kind of product with them today we're show you how to make a SAP now it's best if you go ahead and do your fu stove ahead of times once you make your infused oil you can actually keep it on the shelf for about a year so you can make it way in advance and then use it when you need it now I'm probably going to have some that will lift so I'll just keep it in the pantry and I'm out of sunlight and it will stay good for a year now your next step with making this app your friend is going to be your kitchen scale you're going to need to measure out your oils because you want to know how much exactly you're putting in to your salve you're going to have your infused oils your beeswax and then you're also going to add you can add essential oils or things like that but today we're just using the empties oils and v-flex so I'm going to show you how to do that alright so with this nifty kitchen skill if you go ahead and put your jar on first it's actually going to measure out the tear for you this is the ocre scale it's really good great love it so just going to hit the on button it's going to calculate the weight for you and it's going to start at zero so for starters I need 2 ounces of calendula oil one and a half ounces of arnica one ounce of chamomile so I'm going to go ahead and measure that all out [Music] I thought it had Mexican ate it all sick bounces even so I put in just roughly one and a half ounces of the beeswax give or take you can add more place the recipe to what you like now we're going to take this and set it and make a makeshift double boiler and melt it all down now I've got a saucepan here that's heating up it's on a medium heat you don't want to be boiling but you do want it to be hot water I'm going to go ahead and set my jar down in there the reason that we put the water in there so that we're not scorching the oil or the herb I'm just going to let it sit there for a few minutes as the water heats up and then I'm going to kind of come in and start really good once it's completely stirred and combined then we're going to go ahead and put it in our little tins and it'll dry and be done all right all you got is melted now we need for a medium your 10 [Music] Oh [Music] and just like that you have your very own SAP and this particular side with the Colangelo arnica and chamomile we use specifically for boo-boos and bruises to heal was if you've had a cut or scrape this is great for that this is also great healing for sore muscles it helps relax the body and it's just a really great faff to hat but here's what it ends up looking like and it's just really great to have here's what it looks like you just rub it like this and put it on you're done so there's your basic fab recipe for the day I encourage you to make it make your infused oils make your staff they do really really well they hold up well the last about a year in your medicine cabinet or pantry and that was really good too so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please like and subscribe so you'll get a free to share it so if you guys have a great day happy home studying", "BztVao6vUVY": "at steel

"zaFs3Cmx3Ds": "-You've probably started\nseeing CBD products popping up\nin a lot of places -- pharmacies, health-food stores,\nfarmers' markets. One place it's not\nsupposed to show up -- Amazon. But the e-commerce giant\nhas become an outlet for CBD supplements, despite Amazon's policy\nbarring those items. That's because\nthe vast retail site, where consumers search through\n500 million items on any given day, is too large for even the tech\ngiant to thoroughly police. Sellers use alternative terms, like \"hemp oil\"\nor \"hemp extract,\" to avoid Amazon's\ndetection algorithms that would likely sniff out\nthose listings and remove them. So, to see if third-party\nmerchants were violating Amazon's policy,\nwe decided to buy 13 products that had high likelihood\nof containing CBD and have them tested at EVIO\nLabs in Berkeley, California. We should note that Amazon\nfounder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns\nThe Washington Post. David Egerton is\nthe lab director at EVIO and tested each\nof the products to determine\nif they include CBD. Okay, so, let's look\nat the Select CBD products. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It does. There's close to 900 milligrams\nin the container. -And maybe another giveaway --\nit says \"CBD\" on the label. -It does, indeed. -If I were to go to a\nnatural-food store in Berkeley, and purchase a CBD product\nfrom them, would it have a similar profile? Would it have about 30%, milligrams to milliliter,\nof CBD in it? -It's very difficult to say\nthat for sure, because a lot of these products have a wide range\nof concentrations that we see. Even in what we see\nin front of us here, you know, we can see,\nthere's some products that claim to have\n5 milligrams per serving, others that claim to have 100. -Let's look at\nRestorative Botanicals. Does this have CBD in it?\n-It does, indeed. In comparison to\nthe other sample that we just looked at,\nthere was, say -- where there was only\nCBD detected, here we see\na variety of cannabinoids, including THC,\nat a very low level. But this variety of cannabinoids\nindicates that it was likely manufactured using what they referred to\nas a full-spectrum hemp oil. -Okay, let's go to\nthe Lazarus Naturals. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It absolutely does.\n-And again, dead giveaway, it says \"CBD tincture.\" So, now,\nlet's talk about this one. This is a tincture made\nby a company called Tranquilo. What was interesting to me\nabout this company is, its Twitter\nhandle is AmazonBestCBD. Is there any CBD in this one? -There was no CBD detected\nin this sample. [chuckles]\n-This also says on its label \"hemp oil, 500 milligrams.\" Is there 500 milligrams of anything in this\nthat you detected? -Uh, none of the cannabinoids\nthat we report. -Today we asked you\nto check 13 products. We have them all lined up here. Of these 13 products, how\nmany actually had CBD in them? -11 out of the 13 contained CBD. -And the two that didn't is\nthis one oil from Tranquilo -- -Mm-hmm.\n-And the other, the Hemp Gummies\nhere from Mix Rx. -Correct.\n-So, even though Amazon prohibits\nthe sale of CBD products on its website, we found 11 out\nof our 13 products purchased contained\nthe substance. After informing Amazon of\nour purchases and testing, the company removed some, but not all,\nof the product listings. Amazon said the company\nrequires merchants to follow selling guidelines and that it has teams\nthat use machine-learning tools to keep prohibited products\nout of its marketplace. But the company declined to say\nit believed that no CBD products\nwere available on its site.", "9Ws1nGul3_c": "hold on the gardener here in this video I'm going to show you how to make a comfrey sale I'm going to show you how I make a comfrey cell using comfrey olive oil and beeswax but before I get into that I want to extend a very special thank you to Pamela at Garden garden novice farm on her help in helping me and figuring out how to do this also want to give you a word of caution here do not apply this kind of a salve to an open cut wound because it will cause the wound to heal over on top before it has healed from deep within as a cut wound should heal and once it has caused you to heal over on top it could trap inflammation in deep in that wound which would then of course be a problem for you so don't apply it apply it to an open cut wound all right let's get busy making this out first we gotta go pick some countries and then we have to dehydrate it the nice dark color of green that you see that these leaves indicates that I did not dehydrate it at a high temperature dehydrating at a higher temperature could destroy the beneficial properties of the comfrey and it will definitely make a leaves turn dark brown so once you have them dehydrated and all you have to do is take your hands and rub them together with comfrey and the small particles will fall out now we have our dried comfrey let's move on to the next step so here we have our one cup of dry hump relief and now we want to and a half cups of good olive oil I'm going to use a crock-pot to infuse the country into the oil I'm going to not put the lid on so that will help to keep the temperature a little bit lower you now it's the time to get your jars or containers whatever you're going to use ready Here I am using four ounce jelly jars to melt the beeswax I'm going to use my instant pot as you would a steam double boiler my beeswax came in one ounce sticks so I have given a rough cut you it doesn't take very long with the steam on the bottom of the top to start melting the beeswax now I guess one point I ought to make this is not the stainless steel pot that goes in your instant pot this is another bowl that I will use only for making comfrey infusions okay now our bees wax is melted it's time to add our oil olive oil which has been infused with the comfrey if you want to add this olive oil all the beeswax is still warm so you can get a good mixture I'm going to add 800 I use a vitamin e and this will help as a preservative for our country sale the vitamin E is a little gel cap so punch a hole in one end of it and squeeze the contents out into our oil and beeswax mixture now we're ready to pour our country sail up into our jars make sure to let it cool overnight before you put a lid on it next day there it is come free South that's all there is to it now you know how to do it be sure to mark your leads with the date that you made this it should stay good for about six months you", "53eC9lc61gk": "[Music] the TV deal that this one I take three times a day it's drops under the tongue and I have a little vape pen as well this thing is the only thing that I've found that works for my pain especially my hip pain I can take that and within about 20 minutes I'll know whether I've got to reach for the morphine based drug or not and a lot of the time I actually don't have to go for that which is huge to me I'm very passionate about CBD and I'm actually with some friends and that online we've started a support group for other people with chronic pain illnesses I've got friends now who have MS there's so many conditions that can be treated by CBD that it's not just about fibro it's something that the the world needs access to you know it was which is why I got so upset with chronic pain being missed off the at the bill there recently because there's so many others that don't want to use opiates we want to have a natural alternative to that I'm actually convinced that part of my cognitive decline is actually as a result to my and one of the tablets I've been taking so I'm desperate to get off that because I've struggled find my words I'm actually doing quite well quite impressive myself", "OpRTut8_EaM": "- What's the truth about CBD oil for pain? If you are looking for\nany type of marijuana, cannabis, or insight\ntied to whether or not CBD oil is legal, I'll explain, the crazy sale coming right up. (upbeat music) CBD oil, medical marijuana, and more. Oh my. Great to be with you, hello. Little bit of, spray of that. Imagine that being able to ease your pain. If you've never seen me before, I'm the YouTube Deal Guy, Matt Granite. You might know me from your CBS, NBC, ABC TV stations, I also host\na show for Amazon Live, and I'm Canadian where the\nlegalities of marijuana have really not been\ndebated to the same extent in different countries or cities and, I don't have any type of\npolitical stance on anything. I hunt down deals. I'm here only to answer the question, does CBD oil for pain\nwork and is it legal? So, first things first,\nI'm just gonna make sure I got all my legal notes\nright up here, a reminder, that CBD oil from hemp\nis legal in the U.S., it is not psychoactive cannabinoid. That does not contain\ntetrahydrocannabinol, THC. Do I sound like an expert? No, I'm not. I'm a deal expert. In fact, I actually asked two experts to assist with today's\ndeal, including a doctor. But before we get to that, I have pain. Imagine, if you've ever\nused Bengay, or Icy Hot. Every time you have that\npain, you put it on, you get your hands covered,\nand then you have your, smell like aromatherapy\nfor the next five years, like peppermint extract. And with this beautiful\nbaby, who I've shown you in some videos, by the\nway, she's getting bigger. She weighs over 20 pounds\nnow at eight months, so just about twenty\npounds, and my back, neck, and shoulders are hurting more\nthan they have in the past. The concept of a spray\nthat could alleviate pain, is something that I wanna\nshow to you right now, in fact, there's a deal link for it, just expand the video\ndescription box right under me, and you will have your\nlink revealed to that. But before we get to why I like it, let's actually hear from two experts. I have Dr. Derek, who you\nmight have seen on TV, he's a USA Today contributor, and then Bruno Roder, who is, I believe, a physical therapist, and\nhe also works with people who live with pain across the country. - Pain relief, many people\nare in need of pain relief, possibly problems in the shoulders, the hips, the knees,\nthe back, or the neck. Now there is many ways\ntraditionally, to handle pain relief, many drug medications\nand surgical treatment could be very invasive,\nor some easier things, something newer more modern\nlike CBD oil is extremely effective and is gaining more credibility. Why? Because it gives you\nthe actual pain relief. On top of the fact, what\nI love about this kind is they mix it with magnesium. Now, magnesium, in case you're wondering, is a natural pain reliever, but also, it's a muscle relaxant,\nso it gets the muscles to relax before we get the\ninflammation and the pain out with the CBD oil. Very effective when used\nin conjunction with ice, and some other treatment as well. Take this, one or two\nsprays at the affected area. I love using it on my knees\nor my hands to get rid of some arthritis pain. Also too, I work with a lot of clients that might have pain in the\nlower back or in the knees. Very effective with that as well. And lastly, it smells delightful. You don't have to worry about\nit smelling like a medicine cabinet coming your way, so try this. One or two sprays to the affected area, and you'll be amazed at how fast it works, and how good you feel. - We all get sore. Whether we work out or not, we get sore. I've been turned on to a muscle\nspray that is so amazing. You spray it on, feels cool\nat first, then it warms up, goes right to the\nmuscles, no mess, no fuss, I even like the odor, it's amazing. - So why do I like it? If you have knee, shoulder, hand, foot, neck,\nor back, and hip pain, this unique spray design allows\nfor that clean application, as opposed to those creams, which I mentioned could get messy, and soil other items that you touch. This is also the only natural\nand safe modern extra strength pain relief, without a prescription. So the CBD, you get that pain relief, and the inflammation\nreducer, the magnesium, which is the muscle relaxant. And keep in mind that\nthis is the only product on the market that has both. Magnesium is a natural mineral salt extracted from the brine of the Dead Sea, which allows your muscles to relax. and then the CBD oil,\nobviously, the concentrations, are a natural yet powerful inflammation and swelling reliever. The peppermint oil will\nrefresh and relax your skin, and then the chamomile is\njust another botanical boost to soothe that tired skin. It really works. I've used Icy Hot, or I think it was usually\ncalled antiphygesia, I know they have different\nthings in different countries, but, I'm telling you right now, this is awesome. And despite all of the arguments about what should be\ntransported and made where, and what's in what product, I'm not here to debate any of that, only to tell you that\nthis really does work. And its legal. So that's great. If you do want to take\nadvantage of this item, obviously the company behind this is not paying me to say nice things about them, I'm not endorsing this, I'm\njust telling you that it works. And if you do talk to a chiropractor, physical therapist, or Doctor\nDerek, or another doctor, they can attest the fact\nthat the formulation of this product is beneficial. That's all I'm here to do, show you a deal on it. Click that video. Click that link below the\nvideo description box, I wonder if they had a spray\nto help you speak properly. That would be awesome. And you'll find what you're looking for. Thank you again for watching. The only reason I knew to hunt this down, was because subscribers\nrequested this product. I was actually getting a\nlot of requests for this.

adjusted this is your go-to day today I'll here this is your daily use morning and night middle of the day as needed you know I've even experimented with this putting a couple drops on the skin about 5 to 10 drops on the skin to just see how it would respond to some inflammation maybe a little bit of tennis elbow there this is the Honan sound it's a thousand milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in beeswax there's a little bit of eucalyptus essential oil and a little little bit of lavender essential oil just for a little bit of scent but it's not overpowering it's not too strong it's

depression properties or anti-anxiety properties this is something that I consider a nightly thing or you had a long day you want to you know you went on a long hike you got your elk hunting this is kind of like the you know right before a bad take it this made when I take this at night and I wake up I feel rejuvenated and I feel refreshed 25 milligrams is not a substantial amount of taking at once but it may be a substantial amount for you if you haven't utilized the product and I would recommend taking this at night or late in the afternoon when you're just home for the rest of the day until you see how your body responds to it I wouldn't say it causes drowsiness but it does promote and can promote relaxation and well-being so this is something you know I have to write a long day that you you're on the couch you're a back at camp take one of these and you're ready to go to bed and the properties of this product may help you get back in action in the morning you can also take up to four of these in a day but if you have the oil and the soft gels like they're good pair that go together so you can take the oil as your daily and and then take the soft gels add needed for an

right liquid pumpable lotion that you can use at home but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up so folks today we're going to be making our CBD hand lotion and first and foremost of one ingredient that we did make here on the farm is our hemp Keeffe you can find this on our website pricing and everything and you can make an order this lotion will be available on our website so go ahead and check out the pricing if you just don't want to bother making it you can purchase it from us so just visit our website and all the prices are there and I do appreciate all the support from from all you subscribers that are watching this video I appreciate a lot of support that we've gotten so thank you very much let's dive into what you're gonna need to make CBD hand lotion at home okay folks you are gonna need a lot of things for this so let's get started with you will need an immersion blender or a stick blender of some sort for this recipe you could use a real blender but I don't recommend it you're gonna need some sort of container to put the lotion in here we have a pumpable container you're gonna need some sort of spatula or just you know a mixing device you're gonna need distilled water shea butter emulsifying wax vegetable glycerin which you really can't see in the bowl here and avocado oil along with a preservative of your choice and you can just Google which preservative you think would work best for you this is what we have here and of course our hemp Keith the other thing you're gonna need is a large pan I'll bring it over here you're gonna fill the pan with water and you're gonna have to separate bowls inside the pan and we'll get to that shortly so these are all the ingredients that are required to make this CBD hand lotion it is a lot and like I said folks if you don't want to bother whether you can visit our website and purchase the CBD lotion so folks let's get this party started and let's get into making our CBD hand lotion okay folks now as you can see the big pan here is filled with water we have two separate pots we're gonna go ahead and turn this on to medium low temperature and first we're gonna start doing our oils so we're gonna go ahead and add the emulsifying wax our avocado will now this isn't measured by fluid ounce or anything this is measured by grams and I'll leave that exact recipe in the description below and we're gonna get our shea butter now that's going to have to get brought up to temperature now meanwhile there's two things I want to want you to consider now we're gonna put our water in in this other pot here now this is distilled water okay now the great thing about having vegetable glycerin in this recipe and why it's so important is because the hemp Kieff goes into the vegetable glycerin and this is how it dissolves again and gets into the lotion so I'm gonna bring you back over while this is heating up and we're gonna start dissolving our hemp teeth in the vegetable glycerin alright folks so now that we have all the hemp keith's dissolved in the vegetable glycerin I want to show you kind of what it looks like before we go ahead and put it in the water and it's really like a nice thick pasty no clumps or anything like that you really want it to be nice and thinned out and that is ideal for when we're making the lotion so now we're going to go over and add it to the water part of the lotion there Keefe is nice and dissolve we're just gonna add it to the water bowl here the one with all the water that don't add it to the oil add it to the water and you want to make sure you're getting all of that Keef in there because this stuff is expensive and it really brings up your CBD content for the actual ocean so get all that as much as we can and go ahead and start mixing that around a little bit now you can see it's separating from the glycerine a little bit don't worry about that that is perfectly normal and once we get the oil in it what you won't even notice it does like to separate once it's in the water but not by a lot I mean you can still see that it's fairly dissolved so now we're going to wait for everything to get up to temperature and then we're going to start mixing stuff around so I'll see you in proximately 20 minutes okay folks everything is melted down and at the same temperature and again this is important it has to be the same temperature so what you can do now is you can put the oil with the water or the water with the oil this is going to be the pot so to speak or the container that you're going to emulsify everything in so make sure that it's the larger of the two containers we're gonna go ahead and just add that now and as you can see it became a very white creamy type of lotion look to it and that is perfect for what we need now we want to make sure that that Keef gets in there so we'll be adding making sure sometimes it likes to stick to the side so make sure you get that key off the side that is important for your CBD content of this lotion all right so now we're going to wait about two to three minutes while this sits in the same temperature bath it isn't required but this is something I like to do and as you can see the key floating up here we're gonna mix it around so I'm gonna give it about five minutes and then we're gonna be right back all right folks it's time to take this off the heat bring it over here to cool down we're gonna get rid of this pan of hot water and then what we're gonna do is going to go over here and start reversing blendering everything getting it started to get mixed up as it starts to cool so this is key all right boys have been off the heat for about three to four minutes and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna emulsify and this takes a little bit of time so you're just gonna go ahead and mix it and you don't want to get a lot of air in it so don't don't bring it up and down like that too much just I do it in the very beginning because sometimes some of the oil try separating to the top so I like to bring it down but right now we're just gonna mix it and you're gonna do this on and off for approximately 10 minutes so it's gonna be a while but you don't have to do it continuously you can go ahead and take a break and jump back into it but you're gonna want to mix it for quite a while and get it nice and mixed up so I'll see you folks in probably about 10 minutes all right folks so we've been mixing for about 10 minutes and you can see it's nice and thickened up now I'm gonna turn it on for you real quick and you can see that it's getting nice and thick now it's starting to look like that yeah typical lotion look to it you don't see the the the hemp chief any longer it's all mixed in and so now you're gonna have to wait another 10 minutes while this cools off and while we're waiting I want you to go gather your preservative of your choice again folks you got to go out and research which preservative you're comfortable with there is a lot of them out there this is the one that we went with but you don't have to use that one but you have to use as preservative because of the amount of water that's in this you can also grab some vitamin E you can add that that is not required for the recipe and along with some essential oils if you like essential oils in your lotion so that's what I'm gonna do oh do me to get all that stuff together and I'll see you back in ten minutes it's been about ten minutes and we've measured out our preservative and now as you can see the lotion is exactly what you would think of as a lotion it's very nice it's cooled off and we'll get some of this lotion off of the emulsion blender here yeah it looks awesome and so now is the time you want to get everything going so this is what it looks like nice and fluffy just a typical lotion now there's a lot of ways you can get this back into a bottle for the most part we're going to just put it into that pumpable lotion but right now we're gonna add our essential oils and I'm gonna do about about 10 drops of vitamin E about seven drops of lavender I don't like a strong essential oil so it's not for me you can add as much as you want then we're going to do four grams of preservative and this is really to extend the shelf life of this because it's water-based you can't just get away with not having a preservative you've got to have one all right so now this is all out of their way and so now we're just gonna mix it all around and now you can see that lotion is getting that just nice liquids look to it and it smells absolutely wonderful and so now what you can do is get ready to put it in your container of choice now for us I like to put it in the pumpable bottle but you can put it in a mason jar but the reason I like the pumpable bottle is because it's contained and you're not constantly putting your hands in it because it requires a preservative and because it's water-based you don't want to be adding bacteria to it eventually that preservative won't be able to keep up so what we're going to do is we're going to add it to the bottle and the trick to that is you go ahead and you can get a plastic bag and you put the lotion in it cut the corner and you can fill it that way you can have like a pastry funnel you can do it that way there's a bunch of different ways one of the easiest ways of course is the mason jar but you know the mason jar again you're putting your hand in it constantly folks that's all I have for today I hope you enjoyed this I hope you liked this recipe I mean just look at how awesome this lotion is it smells absolutely wonderful you cannot smell the hemp in it at all because we use em Keefe you can't smell it it is absolutely awesome it's wonderful it smells like lavender and again you can add more lavender if you shoes or you can add any essential oil that you want i like lavender but i don't like a lot of it but it is awesome it smells like a lotion you buy at the store and again it's CBD so this is good for joint pain or anything that you think that CBD can work for you know I'm not going to give any recommendations of what it can cure or anything you can do your research online but yeah this will be available as requested on our website so go ahead and reach out to me again the hemp chief is also available and we'll be getting that out soon so go ahead and visit our website folks but that's all I have for you today I really hope you enjoyed this recipe I hope it works out for you and thanks for watching the video and I will catch you in another video", "Ex4V2im8a5o": "your search for best CBD oil for pain can end here perhaps you're searching for the best CBD oil for acute pain the best CBD oil for chronic pain or maybe even the best CBD oil for pain for my dog there's so many options what do you do right hi my name is dr. Gerry Hosken I'm a retired chiropractor and I've taken a deep dive into finding out just how that all works I became a curious researcher when my wife had surgery and was unable to tolerate her prescribed pain medicine her surgeon prescribed just four little red jelly-like pills that were described as experimental at the time when he classified them as natural and evidence-based I was relieved but when he mentioned that they were derived from cannabis my curiosity peaked with just a bit of alarm as a doctor of chiropractic my class in pharmacology and toxicology was years in the past and it was far more aware of the popular side of cannabis than the medical aspects as a husband I was more concerned and even frantic to get my wife out of pain my wife's surgeon took time over lunch to explain the important changes in the medical application of cannabis products well this was the start of my look into additional natural methods of relieving those isolated pain problems that for one reason or another or no reason at all would not respond to conventional chiropractic or medical methods so just like I was I'm guessing you're looking for the best CBD oil for pain also right perhaps the best CBD oil for neck pain the best CBD oil for back pain so with all the things that come up when I'm in the search and with so many options what do you do well here's what I did so I didn't have a whole lot of pain problems but other people around me did my patients did so I just started using CBD oil for pain just to check it out now I wouldn't use it for acute pain and not like a migraine headache or a sprained ankle or something where you're in acute pain but more for chronic pain you know as an example I had some pain in my left shoulder that seemed to linger most often this chronic pain becomes aggravated from extended time at the computer followed by a night of restless sleep one of my chiropractic friends usually corrects the problem two or three months later my excitement for some online project would enticed me to spend too much time at my desk I know it's my fault that's on me I experimented with all the same topical products that were used in my practice and of course those products gave me very short-term relief and took the edge off the pain ironically I first search for the best CBD oil to alleviate some anxiety issues but then that's the story for another day however that search led to the information that indicated CBD oil could alleviate pain could cannabis products give more pain relief and last longer than the products from my chiropractic practice how well do they perform on more serious paint problems more serious than my minor pain challenges that I can take care of him in my own office from the facts that I found and the personal testimonials that I heard I would say yes yes they do perform better than the products that I've been using but how will they perform for you and for others I don't know you'll just have to find that out for yourself it's a personal decision that again you must decide that for yourself do your due diligence and make the decision personally I've been blessed with good health good health training

old now I'm using the pure hemp works relief to help relax and soothe muscles renew anti aging cream with apple stem cells to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines and then I'm using

crazy-looking bottle is the base lotion that I made in another video and I'll put the link over here for that if you want to learn how to make all-natural lotion from scratch I've put some other additives in it that extra nutrients that are kind of nice but this is my basic lotion that I can use to make other things like sunscreen you can find the video for that over here for natural tinted sunscreen and also to make other things that we want to add different nutrients to it so today I'm going to use CBD oil and I'm going to mix it just simply in with my lotion cream and this is used one

this is one tablespoon of the CBD oil and this has an orange flavor added to it because it's used for internal it doesn't matter you can still use it external so it does smell a little bit orange e it's not orange essential oil though so I think you're okay is for our Sun but I put this on at night just anyway because it might little sticky and by the way CBD oil is not the same as marijuana it's not going to get you high it has no psychoactive properties at all so it's only used for inflammation and things like that so this is really simple I'm just going to stir it up here with my cream

It contains none of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, so there is no \u2018high\u2019 from it. But the many health benefits claimed for CBD including: reducing inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety has seen its use in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics become one of the fastest growing trends in the process industry. Silverson high speed, high shear mixers are increasingly being used for R&D and small scale production in this emerging market. They're ideal for a wide range of applications, including blending, emulsifying, dissolving, disintegrating and powder/liquid mixing. A Silverson can easily mix liquids of widely different viscosities, so high viscosity CBD oil can be blended in a fraction of the time taken by conventional mixers. One of the main production challenges is dispersing the oil into aqueous systems such as beverages, as minimising the droplet size is the key to maximising the yield of the active ingredient. With a Silverson this can be achieved almost instantaneously. The same goes for other ingredients such as flavouring essences which can be difficult to disperse. For emulsions such as creams and lotions, the high shear action of a Silverson mixer finely disperses the droplets to give a stable emulsion with a typical droplet size of 2 - 5 microns. Finer emulsions down to 0.5 microns can also be achieved, depending on the formulation. By simply changing the workhead, the mixer can also be used to perform many other operations such as preparation of gels and sugar solutions, disintegrating solids and incorporating powdered ingredients such as stabilisers and other supplements. Another advantage of Silverson mixers is scaling up from the laboratory to full production is a straight forward process, as all our mixers are engineered to the same fine tolerances and exceptional quality we have been known for, for over 70 years. Whether you're looking to make beverages, gummies, snacks, baked goods or creams, shampoos, lotions or capsules, a Silverson mixer offers the most versatile and efficient solution to your mixing requirements.

probably hearing a lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "u1iUDSIx7Jc": "it's really important to make sure we start with the clean urine sample which is what we did so this is what you take see believe ten days the video hi I'm David I love fitness wellness and all things CBD this is my office this is my temple and this it's all green TV is it a banger what's happening this David it's all green TV now other people worry if taken see buddy is gonna make them grow fail a drug test well we talked about it in other videos I thought proofs in the pudding so what have I done over the last 10 days I've been taking see 20 50 milligrams every single day and here's what happens now I want to show you that I've completely clear system beforehand so I've taken a test in advance we're gonna check back in the overlay so you can see that you can see I'm being completely honest I'm clean as a whistle so we've got on the under cameras on the best angle so this is the multi screen drug test can test for many different things I'm gonna dunk in here for just 15 seconds so I'm just gonna so there you go that's my piss on a jar so two lines means negative so let's find out over the next 10 days if taking CBD we're gonna use sample vial for no fail so it's not branded yet you'll see if broad-spectrum CBD can cause you to have all failed drug tests that's it so that's it this was the benchmark this was me introducing myself as an absolute weirdo let's find out what happens when we take CBD oil we use 500 milligram what do you think 10 days well we found a drug test so I doubt right so day one go ahead I'm branded bottle for a no-fail CBD we're gonna take one full pipette to 10 more bottle 500 milligram in that means 50 mg per day which is generally in good allowance to take per day part of this testing option we're taking these drops to see whether or not will we favor drugs tests of CBD so just so you know we could do 10 days Nora okay Google what's the date today it is Wednesday the 14th of August 2019 there you go so this is day 1 I think I want [Music] [Music] 25 20:19 what [Music] so got this little bad boy here this is a drum turf the actually test for loads more things than just CBD doesn't necessarily test for THC and this is the thing people worry about is see video oil will bring up the THC metabolites that's what shows up on a drugs test and if you work in an engineering industry nursing medical science police force whatever the last thing you wanted to be pulled up for a CDT compulsive drug test to get them in the forces and sharp like that the THC if you haven't ever had a split or haven't been smoking weed that's the last and once you can use basic CBI so we wanted to show that RC videos see videos that we work with as flexi we need our remedy it's even a dispensary use the same source it's broad spectrum CVD that means it's been filtered for today from from the source and i want to do a little turn they test to show you whether or not it comes up on a drug test and i'm going to show that it doesn't what it's hoping if you see this video didn't come up on the drug test i want to go for a piss I'm going to take a wife otherwise technically a sexual-harassment to get anyone else to fill me I can correspond to to just shake your home health drug test kit mean tampered with right one step so that's before don't give the piss for 10 to 15 seconds and then we read it in five minutes there's the tester as you can see we're looking for this one here at THC [Music] and we'll leave that for five minutes so I've already seen it was all come for anyway it doesn't wait five minutes generally but if the second line comes forever that means is negative which is an absolute relief I'm gonna show you here I'm gonna check on the camera can actually see it it is the second from the left see th see to try and bring it down this is really hard to try and do it while focusing on the camera you can see bring along TC warmly cocaine is quite faint but yeah there you go so you can take your CBD for last ten days taking 50 milligram every single day 500 milligram ball that was the broad spectrum CBD oil from Fleck CBD so if you do sports and your industry then you worried about drug tests or it's showing up for THC test cannabis tests what CAC is there you go 10 days that's what happened didn't shove the drug test I wouldn't fail a drug test so now you know you're not going to find a drugs test provider you take Bruce paradise of the CBD now you're gonna jump over on the next

suffer from migraines or anxiety or sleep deprivation then please keep watching this video because as you can tell from the title I started taking CBD oil about a month ago regularly and I am feeling like a new person but before we get started if you're new here and you like content like this holistic healing nutrition veganism lifestyle and all that good stuff oh and also education because I'm currently a Dietetic student at the moment make sure you hit that subscribe button and also that notification bow so bye well that's interesting I just got a text message but make sure you hit that notification bell so that you know whenever I post a new video which is weekly by the way I also have social media is like the instagrams and the Twitter's so if you're ever you know wondering what I'm doing in my day to day you could check me out over there but let's get into the video so in a CNN report and I just looked this up because I was really curious about it but in 2016 it was reported that the average American spends about half their day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you spend your day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you're an average American or if you're an average American then you automatically spend the rest of your day in front of the screen but I'm saying that I'm pretty much the average American I currently have my social medias I make youtube videos so I mean that's just a lot of screen time in general and then I have my phone where I'm spending a lot of time behind the screen and then I'm currently interning as a Dietetic intern where a lot of the times in the hospital the dieticians and their time behind a computer screen reading charts learning about patients trying to prescribe the right diet or modified diets and that's a lot of strain on my eyeballs I first realized that I was training my eyeballs a lot I think in the beginning at like the end of 2017 the beginning of this year because I started taking on more online classes all of my books are online and I edited a lot of videos and I noticed that when I spent a lot of time on my computer and behind my phone I we get migraines for days and you know when Millennials use the term for days that just like exaggerating until like five minutes I literally got migraines for days and at first I tried using blue light glasses which helps because it kind of blocks the harsh light that comes from screens sorry if you can hear sirens I'm just recording from my room right now I live right next to a hospital what has really helped me these past couple weeks was CBD oil and this CBD oil specifically is from green roads and they were kind enough to sponsor this video so thank you green roads I have been wanting to use CBD oil for a long time and like actually try it with my migraines and I actually tried it before I got into contact with green roads one of my friends actually suffers from chronic migraines and she let me try some of her CBD and it was amazing like my migraine went away it was in a couple hours that's something that I was trying to get rid of like all day and all of a sudden it wasn't like a magical oh it's gone but at the end of the day I was like whoa what my migraine go that's weird so then I was looking into really good CBD oils and I came across this one which is pharmacists formulated so it's medical grade CBD in case you wanted to know CBD does not get you high CBD is economic cut CBD stands for cannabidiol it's one of the many chemical compounds in the cannabis plants CBD and THC are the two most prominent chemical compounds in the cannabis plant but unlike THC CBD does not have a psychoactive factor in it so it does not get you high we actually have a whole endocannabinoid system in our bodies that is responsible for maintaining a healthy balance at every stage of biological life so we have a bunch of endocannabinoid receptors in our body that's because our body creates endocannabinoids does that help with so many functions in our lives but the problem is that our body also creates enzymes that break down these endocannabinoids so the purpose of implementing exogenous CBD like CBD oil which also comes in like different forms so there's an edible which there's like a fruit roll-up that Green Road sent me but I ate it already and they also have cream this I use but I'll talk about it later the purpose of adding exogenous DVD into our system is so that it can reduce the enzymes that break down the endogenous cannabinoids that our bodies make because our endocannabinoid system works with so many areas of our bodies CBD has been linked to so many things such as epilepsy there's been so many papers on epilepsy epilepsy pain chronic anxiety inflammation sleeps just to name a few those are the biggest ones but if you want to know more I will leave a link in the description below that literally shows like why people use CBD like people use CBD for acne treatment why people use CBD for lupus why do people use CBD for Addison's disease or digestive problems or autism or social anxiety so you can check all those out but right now I just wanted to talk about the personal benefits that I've had by using CBD oil this past month it's really made such a huge difference in my life like now I don't even use those blue light glasses anymore and I'm behind a screen all the time and I take CBD every night and I not only sleep better I not only have less anxiety but I've also been able to not have as many migraines throughout my weeks migraines are actually really crippling because you're going throughout your day and you want to think about good things and you want to be comfortable and you want to be productive but all you can think about is this pain just like radiating all over and I used to just be like you know what this migraine will go away it'll be fine my body's strong it's a warrior but what actually happens is that when you allow your body to stress itself out enough you create more and more cortisol which is not good for your body if you guys know about cortisol that's the stress hormone by using the CBD oil nightly and so I'll just do like three to five drops leave it under my tongue for at least 45 seconds and then swallow it has really really helped me wind down in the evening and the next day I don't have a migraine and throughout the day I don't have migraines and I didn't even realize this until two or three weeks into using it and I was like wait I used to get migraines all the time and I'm on a screen way way way more now than I have been before and I really honestly believe that it has to do with using CBD oil have you see video before but I recorded my first reaction of using the CBD oil on camera for you guys so you could see it so I'll show you now hey hey guys just got back from the gym and I look like a boy but I promise I have hair looks like this and has vegetable glycerin Fido cannabinoid rich oil essential hemp oil so place one two three drops under the tongue for at least ten to thirty seconds before swallowing this tastes really good and I'm told what this is but it tastes really really good first impression just like saliva building up in my mouth because I can't swallow anything but on a small office first impression is that it tastes really really good immediately I dropped it under my tongue I felt a little bit of tingling under my tongue but the tingling went away and now I am I guess I'm just waiting for the calmness to overcome me but I just came from a long day at my internship and I have a huge migraine because I was looking at the screen all day and that normally is what happens to me I really like the days it's pretty good back to you Amanda now I'm about four weeks into using it and I've never felt any better when I was actually sitting down to write out my thoughts on CBD I realized that I have been sleeping way better it kind of helps me like relax and wind down for the night there have been so many studies documenting CBDs beneficial effects on anxiety and noticed that that anxiety is kind of wound down more from when I started using CBD and I'm just way more relaxed and I fall asleep way easier and I stay asleep my problem is I fall asleep but then I wake up and I fall asleep and then I wake up and I never really felt completely rested when I woke up from my sleep so say I'd sleep like a good like six to eight hours because that's like a good time for me I'll wake up and feel like I still haven't slept but ever since using this I've honestly felt rested like I wake up and I actually wake up and ready to go yeah I'll hit the snooze button for five minutes but in that five minutes I'm like still awake and I'm just like letting myself rest a little bit more but I know that I'm awake and I don't just like knock right back out what I've set my snooze you know what I mean DVD is definitely helped with my migraines my sleep quality and as for anxiety I feel like I've just mentioned this over and over again there's no black and white where it just you know I'm super super anxious and all of a sudden huh I'm good I'm chill but it's just this gradual like hmm I can think about other things now I'm doing other things now and then I look back and I'm like wait wasn't I just like extremely anxious a couple of minutes ago huh so that's what it's been like for me so long story short that's what my experience has been like using CBD and I will continue to be using CBD oil because it has been so beneficial if you've never tried it and you suffer from the like sleep deprivation and anxiety migraines inflammation pains and aches in your bodies I would highly suggest trying out CBD it's completely legal it's safe good for your body speaking of body aches the green roads also has this bare green muscle and joint cream and I actually use it on my jaws because I have this gum chewing problem and like I've been really really trying to not chew as much gum but my jaws will get really really sore and they'll actually hurt and I notice it when I use this they're agreed and just like put it on my jaws it has this nice like calming effect and then my jaws just don't hurt anymore not to say that the soreness goes away completely but I just don't feel like as tight and tense and so I feel like this would be really good for those of you who have like tense necks or tense backs were like you always feel like you're holding tension there because your muscles are constantly I mean because that can happen when you're stressed and anxious subconsciously you just hold a stiffness in your body because that's the mood or that's the emotion that's going on within you and it just manifests physically but I feel like this could really help with that now you know CBD works for migraines anxiety sleep at least for me and I hope if you give it a try for those issues it works for you as well if you want to know more about CBD or you're not completely convinced please click the links in the description below I hope you guys learned something from this video and that you enjoyed it if you have ever experienced using CBD or if you use CBD

have things like protein vitamins like vitamin b vitamin e vitamin a zinc vitamin c vitamin c biotin uh tea tree oil what else rosemary oil these products that i chose for my hair has really been showing my hair some improvement so let's just go ahead and you know get started and let me just tell you about these combos that i find that is good for my hair okay alright so let's get started with the first product and it is a shampoo this particular brand i'm going to show these two at the same time this particular brand i found at my neighborhood beauty supply store i didn't find it anywhere else i did find it online at amazon but i got mine at the beauty supply store and it is this product here it is the sunny aisle refinish and rejuvenating moisturizing shampoo with c b d i'm going to put on the screen here all the benefits that cbd brings to your hair strands the cbd is working i know you guys have seen so many products or even just on the news the different states are starting to legalize cbd cbd oil because you know everyone is starting to find out that cbd has a lot of healing agents growing agents and just so many agents within cbd that's just all around helpful for your health this is a moisturizing shampoo and it is infused with jamaican black castor oil and it has a thousand mcg per ounce of pure cbd the shampoo you don't need a whole lot but it's very moisturizing my hair really loves it it does not strip my hair paired with this i paired this at the end of my wash routine and this is the moisturizing conditioner which is also infused with jamaican black castor oil and this also has a thousand mcg per ounce of pure c b d but one thing is for sure that i know is that it rejuvenates the hair strand and the scalp which is a breeding ground for growing hair the next product that i have been using faithfully is this edens body works natural conditioner it is the peppermint tea tree moisturizing and detangling conditioner i love this product because it packs a huge punch of peppermint and tea tree you soon as your scalp feels this conditioner your scalp just automatically just start tingling i love this product and it smells really good and everyone knows that peppermint and tea tree well tea tree is really good for cleansing the scalp and getting any like debris or impurities and things like that lifted up off the scalp and peppermint is really good for stimulating your scalp which in turn does what produces hair growth so love this i use this every single week in conjunction with everything that i am going to talk to you guys about today alright the only thing that i don't use weekly um is the moisturizing shampoo but i do use that every two weeks the next product that i love to use is the main choice this um three in one revitalizing refresh conditioner it is a co-wash leave-in and a detangler i have been using this probably twice a week because i have been trying to get really into moisturizing and deep conditioning my hair twice a week instead of once a week and i'll tell you why towards the end of this video but i really love this particular product because of biotin that it has in it i and the vitamin e that it has in it which in turn promotes hair growth so you see where i'm going with this this is really good for hair growth and the vitamin e is really good for moisture so with those two naturally it's going to be a breeding ground for good nutrients and hair growth so this particular product here all right and for my next item here which is a deep conditioner i have a bunch of deep conditioners okay and i've used almost all of them but i wanted to hone in on just one particular deep conditioner because i wanted to find out which deep conditioner is working really well for my hair and that is this shea moisture black sorry this shea moisture jamaican black castor oil strength and restore treatment mask this deep conditioner has shea butter moisture peppermint peppermint told you peppermint another product peppermint these ingredients are really good to stimulate hair growth okay along with the apple cider vinegar which is apple cider vinegar is a cleansing agent and it also helps balance your ph levels in your hair strand been using this for years but like i said i wanted to really just hone in on one particular deep conditioner just to make sure that i'm able to give you guys like just some set ingredients or set products that is really working for me all right so moving right along i just want to talk about just a couple of more items next thing is your oils oils are very important they have so many moisturizing and healing and cleansing agents and most of all they have some awesome scalp rejuvenating agents in them so i have really really really been adopting oils to my hair and scalp massages every night using these particular oils every single night so the oils couple of oils that i do want to talk about one of them is main choice like this growth oil is really good um let's see what it says here it's timeless length and lasting retention releases clogged oil and buildup on the scalp it also has biotin in it and a few other oils in here like grape seed oil sweet almond oil they have some sativa oil in here sativa oil cbd sativa if you know then you know all right so love this oil every night i put a little bit so i don't do all of these oils every night i kind of like alternate them i would probably use this one every other night but every single night i do use this miles rosemary mint scalp and hair strengthening oil this has it is infused with biotin and encourage and it encourages hair growth it is for daily use it's a scalp treatment and it also um has split end care look this is like my third bottle and i'm gonna tell y'all this really works it really really works like rosemary and mint that mint is like the peppermint that stimulates scalp stimulating and the rosemary with the healing and the the the gr the length retention properties in it this is a good one you don't necessarily have to get this brand but you definitely want to just think about the rosemary and the mint you know avocado oil again peppermint oil tea tree oil all of those type of oils will definitely help and aid in hair growth all right and one last product that i do want to mention is moisturizing milks if you are low porosity that means that your hair follicles are not open it actually takes a lot for your hair follicles to open like things like heat and um steam things like that opens up your hair follicles pretty easily and i try not to use a lot of like heavy thick like butters because it's hard for it to get inside of my hair strands so i really love this tginn sweet honey hair milk that is this is with raw honey and agave nectar that raw honey is giving you moisture moisture moisture moisture okay and this has so many uh moisturizing agents in it when i put this on my hair um my i can probably go maybe okay i'm not gonna push it okay two days i'm going to say about two days without re-moisturizing my hair and you can get this tgi in along with the main choice shea moisture and the eden's bodyworks you can get those all at your local beauty supply store along with the sunny aisle cbd moisturizing conditioner and moisturizing shampoo at your local beauty supply store but if you cannot get it there you can definitely find it on amazon now i am telling you guys all of this because i have decided to put myself or take myself on a hair care journey for 2021 okay the first three months of 2021 and i am starting now i actually i started probably last week but to really get my hair in tune with it and let you guys know with what i'm doing i'm recording i'm filming and editing this video in december december but i am going to be really going full fledged with this hair growth challenge come january one okay it's all about hair retention thickness and growth okay so the the hair that you grow you want to retain it and the hair that you're retaining you just want it to continue to just get be flourished and growing okay now you guys probably want to know is this my hair well the answer is no this is not my hair but i will say these are my hair goals i'm not too far off the thickness i'm far off but i will get there that's why i'm doing this whole challenge this is like those headband head band wigs that have been going around everywhere i don't want to tell you where i got this one from because it was a little pricey and when i started doing more research i found out that i could have got this wig right here for a fraction of the cost so i don't want to tell you where i got this particular one from but you can definitely search online headband wigs and you will be able to find so many companies that are doing it i'll list maybe two below that i feel like is a good price i will say that okay this particular headband wig is a1 okay it's thick i did have to dye it i dyed it um black a natural black it did come like a natural brown color and the thickness i didn't have to cut anything the texture is a 3c4a no the texture is a 3 b3c which is my texture here i do have a little 4c in there but it's really mostly at the top and but the rest of them it looks exactly like my hair just not as full this is 14 inches and i believe it's 150 density and it's about 22 inches round that's actually a little bit too big for my hair so i'm gonna have to do some alterations but i love this you guys know this is me okay y'all know this is me so i am gonna be doing these headband wigs for the next two or three months and while i'm doing that i'm going to be moisturizing conditioning scalp massages using these type of products with these type of ingredients in them i will list you know what i can do i can list all the ingredients that you want to be looking for in your hair products i'll list them also below so then that way you can kind of like go back and forth take a screenshot or whatever so when you're looking for your products because you don't have to get these products that i mentioned okay you can these products are not the only products that have these awesome ingredients in it but

illegal in Texas except for certain medical conditions with the doctor's recommendation stores though are still selling it but will it show up on a drug test David Schecter verifies have you heard of CBD oil it's growing in popularity as a natural way to treat epileptic seizures and more broadly anxiety and insomnia the issue is how close CBD is scientifically to marijuana verified fast facts marijuana is rich in the compound THC which gets you high CBD is not marijuana but it still has a tiny bit of THC in it which has some people wondering can CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test for answers I'm looking at what the law says and I'm reaching out to one of the largest lab testing companies in America quest Diagnostics maybe you've peed in their cup dr. berry sample is the director of science and technology and yes that's really his name can the use of CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test CBD itself on our test would not be confused with either THC or THC metabolite number one so analytically we can clearly differentiate the two substances so you've passed last year with the 2018 farm bill Congress permitted the interstate commerce of hemp products like CBD that contain not more than 0.3 percent THC a very low level doctor sample is saying that amount of THC is so low that a test won't pick it up case closed right wrong as a product CBD oil is not regulated in the United States that means the government is not ensuring the level of THC remains low and in fact research in the Journal of the American Medical Association tested a variety of CBD oils and found 43% had more THC in them then labeled doctor sample says that's a big problem if somebody is using a CBD oil product that contains residual THC in it they very likely could test positive on a urine drug test not because of the CBD itself but because of a contaminant that is in that oil so CBD should not cause you to fail a drug test but in reality it could if you've got something you want verified send me an email [Music]", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "7tAWi8nrWXQ": "now it is national CBD day recognizing the hemp derived supplement that many people use daily for self-care but before gets onto our store shelves there is an extensive process that starts it in the growing fields News 5s Jessica barreto joining us live with more on that this morning Jessica free right now I'm at the fields at Veritas Farms where we're surrounded by about 38,000 hemp plants and I'm actually joined by the VP of agriculture here Spencer fuller Spencer talked to me about what we're seeing around us yep right here we are in the middle of our field agriculture this is where all of our hemp plants flower off they're gonna be here until about October when we begin the harvest process we put these out in May and we're expecting around 70,000 pounds of dried hemp plant yep in the greenhouse we saw the moms and over here we're seeing what the moms actually produced all their little babies so we do drip irrigation basically what that is is each little plant gets its own watering and we run that on a cycle through our own well here on on property and we're a 100% organic cultivation awesome and so you have some products on you can you talk to me about what these are yep right here we have our solve it's a cooling menthol it's really awesome super cooling obviously and our moisturizing lotion you can't go wrong with that as well as our orange cream lip balm you can find these in Kroger stores City Market King Soopers so how long does it take from us to see the plants here to them going inside those products it's gonna take us about six months to finish our process here before we hand it over to extraction okay awesome anything else you wanted to ask no I think just kind of enjoy the view Thank You Spencer appreciate it and actually industrial hemp was a federally legalized in 2018 with the passing of the farm bill so now you can find all these products online and inside retailers - always watching out for you Southern Colorado Jessica barreto used by", "10-0Rb6Je2Q": "[Music] hey guys it's alicia from pure cbd vapers today we're going to be doing a brand interview series with one of the top brands in cbd let's get started hey everybody my name is chris coward and i'm the founder and ceo of blue moon bmh ventures uh with me is matt byrne my national director of sales and we're here to talk to you about uh blue moon hemp and our sister brand swiss relief um it's been a been a long journey we were one of the original pioneers in the industry i first was exposed to cbd in the fall of 2014 and repaired a a shoulder injury related to golf that i was able to avoid injury on surgery on and uh became a believer spent all 15 kind of research in it because it was so unknown and in january of 2016 i launched blue moon hemp we started in the vape space because back then that was the only place that cbd was currently being sold and i knew less about fate than i did about cbd which was nothing but we quickly found out that with some ingenuity and some some good luck get some great uh attraction with some good formulators we created the best tasting e-liquid vape uh in the industry and came to dominate uh the vape space over the next four years uh in over 5000 shops and then swiss relief was born uh into late 2017 and debuted in 2018 uh and it's the more mainstream brand you can see the white cross celtic cross on the red background um and it's been a a wonderful journey not only have we helped to pioneer and raise awareness of what cbd is and how it works but we've had incredible interactions and experiences with our customers over the years and have helped literally hundreds of thousands [Music] and where are you guys located we are located in south florida pompano beach is our corporate headquarters and we have labs in miami scottsdale california and kentucky [Music] where do you guys source your cbd from so uh everything you see here is domestically sourced uh we've got multiple farms across the country we've we've been partnered with farms in kentucky since inception of the company but you know as the industry has expanded into different products like cbg concentrates and different cannabinoids that are being incorporated into the cbd products we had to expand our farm source system so we're working with farms in oregon colorado now and the list continues to grow uh just to kind of touch on what chris mentioned you know one of the most unique things about this industry when he started was this is the first time in a long time that i've given someone a product and i didn't have to call them back to ask how they did they they called me back to tell me how well this worked for them so within two weeks of working together i realized right away you know this is the real deal and uh four years later here we are [Music] and what do you guys think really separates your brand from all the other cbd brands well i would have to say it's our pedigree the fact is that we started early and we chartered a course that said we were only going to be best of class uh and we've earned that these awards indicate that their verification of that but it came about through a labor of love and hard work and science to get to that to get to that end goal in other words it wasn't slap slapdash we don't depend on other people to make our products uh we control the process so we know what's there we use top of the line ingredients and everything uh and it cost us more but i always said that people will pay for the quality and that's that's what we've been from day one uh many people call it the cadillac brand of cbd uh it's simply the best in class and we continue to do that and we put a lot of our resources back into research and development to continue uh the evolution of creating new products better products new delivery systems isolating the miners and beginning the combination effects so that we can target certain conditions inside the body we are not a medical company we do not make any medical claims however we do know that cbn has a sedative effect we do know that cbg has a more inflammatory relief pattern so as you're able to adjust those levels up and down you're going to get a blend that may stay calm or you may have one that may say rest yep uh and it'll help to enhance those things so i think just the fact that we we've been there and have always done it right and we're available uh we provide great feedback to our our client base both on a corporate and on a retail level we have a we like to think that we provide some level of trust and authority for questions that come into our website and our our customer service line so if we don't know the answer we're going to go find it for you kind of to piggyback on what chris said it's it's one of those things where we've never purported to be the cheapest brand around but we are absolutely the premium brand available at the best pricing and it's allowed our customer base to afford a top quality product without breaking the pocketbook which is you know which is the case for a lot of the other premium brands out there and and you don't want their only option to be a substandard brand so we we decided you know what we're going to tackle that market [Music] now can you explain to me a little bit about the manufacturing extraction process absolutely so the manufacturing and the extraction this happens on-site at our processing facilities at the different farms located across the country uh for all of our extraction it's a it's a whole plant extraction process using a cold press co2 so it's the cleanest extraction method leaves behind no heavy metals uh no no you know contaminants free radicals that can get into the body you're left with a pure cbd that's that's upwards of 99.6 to 99.8 percent pure uh this extraction method also leaves you with what's called triple zero non-detectable thc uh that's very important to us because at that level it's non-detectable for a drug test that means individuals in the military individuals dealing with certain legal issues anybody that can't have thc showing up on a drug test but needs the benefits of cbd you know that's our market not to mention you know everybody else that needs but um what we do is we'll take that that co2 extracted crystalline and we'll emulsify it into our tinctures our salves our gummies so you're seeing consistency not only from month to month but throughout every product in the lineup uh really important these days because uh most products out there you test them one month it's not going to be the same percentage as the next month and maybe not for everybody but for a lot of people it's very important that they're getting a consistent regimen and one of the things we do with that we call it our our seal of purity and potency and what that is all of our products are third-party lab tested by batch number lot number so you can go on the website and track your your product to that specific block and read the test results of the product so there's no heavy metals there's no solvents there's no pesticides herbicides insecticides yeah you're getting pure cbd with pure constituent ingredients and that's going to give you a desired effect right i mean it's if you use products that are ultra cheap there's probably a reason for that uh stuff that comes a product that comes in out of china and india which there is quite a bit in the market i would rate a substandard and i would not use we never have we never will we are all domestic product and with fda labs doing the testing etc you're unsure to the quality great what type of quality control measures do you guys have in place we test it at every level it's tested in the field before it's harvested it's tested uh three times during the extraction uh process uh when it comes to our facility it's tested again uh once it goes into formulation uh then it's tested as it comes out by us and then it's tested by a third-party lab so again there's just a constant scrutiny and verification that the product is everything that's we say what's trust the label what's on what's on the label is in the bottom uh and that's not always the case so there's a qr code on every item that we ship out that is easily accessible to anybody with a smartphone that will actually bring them back to the the lab results for that batch of product uh this is something that is really kind of changing the game for a lot of people allowing them to differentiate between substandard products and products that they really want to put into their daily regimen um so yeah you know people buy a product from us they get it in the mail they take a picture of that qr code and they can see the detailed analysis you know of that lab report ensuring no heavy metals no pesticides no herbicides triple zero non-detectable thc level um all these measures that chris touched on and the qr code you know we've been doing this for probably close to two years now we were the first to put the qr code yeah exactly so so these standard kind of requirements as far as safety and protocol we kind of adopted a little bit previous knowing that that was coming down the road so you know we're kind of hitting the ground running on that end yeah and we and we are part of several trade associations and some national lobbies in washington um and we we kind of have a sense of what we think that the industry is going towards and we're gearing ourselves for that all that being said it's the government and they're sometimes they take longer than they say they will and sometimes they act quicker than you ever thought they could but we're always trying to uh be as matt indicated way ahead of the curve in terms of our compliance in terms of our reporting our information availability and we want it to be hard because there's too many other companies that are sprouting up that do not have those verification methods that do not have that testing do not you don't know where their cbd came from in other words we could track it all the way from the field into the bottom so it's seed to bottom and i would venture to say that well over half of the newer companies that are out there that simply don't have that so so uh caveat of thor buyer beware uh but you want to make sure that you know what you're getting what was the real inspiration for you guys to create a cbd brand i hate surgery and i was a competitive golfer and i had a torn labrum and they wanted to cut on me and i said well let me let me go and and try some alternative therapy and i ended up at an acupuncturist my chiropractor said i can't help you go see this acupuncturist and my arm was frozen and she stuck all those needles in me and she unfroze it but it still had a lot of pain and i didn't know i mean it was moving but i was i was not in good shape and she opened her curtain and she says you need some some magnesium and some of this and some of that and then she said you need cbd and i said well what is cbd and she says well it's cannabidiol and i said well what is that and she says it's the extract from from cannabis i said well i'm i'm in recovery for a very long time i said i can't take any any mood altering substances and she says it doesn't have any thc in it and i said you have unleaded weed why and she said she says you have to talk to this doctor in colorado and she wrote down a number a 3-1-0 number colorado or 303 and i called i called up and it was must have been a slow day and i spent over two hours on the phone i had done my research and i asked him every question he could and he explained to me about the endocannabinoid system and he's this and that and he talked me into a 500 milligram tincture for 200. and that was a lot of money back then still a lot of money and i said okay i want to do it and and it came in the mail and it was in a brown bottle with no label and a brown vapor envelope so i thought to myself well i guess i guess i got taken and uh but i believed in the guy so i said i'm going to go through with it and i put it under my tongue like he said i rubbed it into my shoulder even though he didn't tell me to and two weeks later i was hitting golf balls uh not pain-free but to the point that i knew i was going to recover and within within about six weeks i was fully recovered uh and i've been taking it every day since that time so that was my inspiration but i'll tell you the inspiration is reinforced and continues every day because we get thousands and thousands of testimonials from clients whose lives have been impacted for the better and it's not uh it's it's as matt said we're on a mission and that mission is to uh is to spread wellness and and we're able to do that we're really happy and grateful for that opportunity [Music] so what's one of your number one selling products and why uh best-selling products here are going to be our thousand milligram berry tincture uh tincture's still the most popular way the largest number of people are getting their cbd through tincture right now um and it shows in the sales the flavoring we use is is really top notch there so most cbd tinctures you're going to have a very earthy vegetation taste and we offer that natural as well there's some people that just like that flavor but the the feedback we get on our berry flavoring on our peppermint flavoring it's it's it's pretty you know pretty astonishing at just how much people enjoy you know taking their tincture getting their cbd and they're surprised at the fact that they enjoy the flavor as well um so that you know that with the fact that you're taking it sublingually uh it's getting directly into the bloodstream through absorption under the tongue it's it's very simple to use um and it goes a long way you know a thousand milligram tincture that's that's you know close to 30 33 milligrams a day which is a pretty good a pretty good dose yeah i'm going to take a little bit of credit here i came from a background of food and beverage so that that fruit blend is uh it took it took 42 tries in the lab to come up with that but it's nine fruits and berries um guava papaya mango tangerine strawberry watermelon blueberry sure forgetting something else in there but uh it took quite a bit but when we when we got it it was just one of those aha moments where we said this is it and uh she's she's she served us well and you know quickly on the heels of the tinger uh the number of gummies that we sell especially like melatonin and cbd combined gummies it's it's astonishing um people are really looking to incorporate cbd into their daily regimen so it's grown so much from fate uh vape was actually a very effective way to get cbd into your system but not everybody vapes and you know we don't go around encouraging people who don't vape to start vaping so it was amazing to watch this this this vape culture that embraced cbd and started getting the health benefits from cbd first and then everything grew out of that uh the tinctures the topicals the gummies um sprays oral sprays gel caps and it's it's uh continues yeah it's transdermal patches the food items will the edibles going into chocolates and coffee and beverages will be the next evolution as soon as fda approves that we've done a lot of r d on that already we just uh we're ready we just want to be sure that it's compliant when we put it out so tell me one of your favorite stories from a customer using one of your products um well i mean one of the most amazing like things about this is i actually have a personal experience we we make a line of pet products as well so going back a little ways i have a small dog that had a really severe accident fell looked like it was going to be touch and go there for a while we were kind of preparing ourselves for the worst uh spinal cord wasn't broken full x-rays and all that um but you know weeks went by without the dog being able to use it's the lower half of its body um so you know myself and my wife we're we're kind of having those conversations about you know what's the quality of life for this dog how's it going to be able to move on from that are we going to be able to move on the way this is and uh you know i actually was telling chris about it i had come into the lab and he's like you know give this a shot so he gives me the strongest dog tincture we make it's a it's a great dane formula and this is a chihuahua mix so that'll give you kind of the the levels i was going to um and some of the treats some of the pet treats that we manufacture um i started giving the treats started putting the tincture in every meal and miraculously within i'd say about a week and a half maybe closer to two weeks of steady steady uh uh servings the dog started twitching its leg it started scratching itself and and now i find myself in a time where the dog can walk it's not healed it can't jump up on the bed anymore but the dog can walk it can it can move it can go outside by itself and uh i'm fully fully convinced that the cbd was the trigger that allowed that inflammation to come down enough that that you know it kind of saved us from from making a decision we didn't want to have to make so it's uh you know you hear about the stories but there's there's something when it happens to you personally or to somebody in your life personally i would have to say that's that's the most amazing one [Music] great so if there's one last thing you could tell your customers that are watching the video right now about you your brand or your products what would that be thank you we've had customers that have been with us for four years and brand loyalty to me the ultimate testament to what you do uh we've had some that have said well i'm going to go try this and they come back and they say you know i tried it but you're still the best so just a lot of gratitude really i started this it's funny there's a philosophy that says when you know something in a way that has allowed for that manifestation to occur well that's exactly what happened with me and cbd in this company and this organization is that i had a little bit of a vision of what i thought it should be could be and i was able to bring that to market in a way that was kind of against all odds back in the day but it brought me matt and darren and rod and john my old ex-partner who recently passed away allowed us to to come together as a unit and create this and uh i think that if it weren't for the feedback and the purchasing from our our client base our customers our family we call the global family then you know none of this is possible so it's only with the heartfelt uh gratitude a full heart that i say thank you yeah yeah i i would have to say these you know chris touched on him earlier and you know these are crazy times there's people out there fighting for their health fighting for change you know it's it's it's it's just there's there's momentum and there's movement picking up across the country in a hundred different aspects and uh you know this is just something that can help everybody the anxiety the aches and pains the inflammation quality of life is what we're about and and this is something that everybody out there fighting for something you know this can this can help you out there yeah we have a hashtag it's crazy stay calm yes so take your cbd every day put the sam on where it hurts uh tell us your story we love to hear your stories and we have a forum for that on our website uh but uh anything that you you want uh questions uh put them in put them in our our uh info at or info at swissrelief.com they go directly to our our resident guru who will answer you personally uh follow us on social media at blue moon swiss relief uh on uh instagram facebook and twitter and we'd love to hear from you thanks a lot guys peace out [Music] yeah yeah [Music] you", "qe7eDBoTj2c": "why does it feel like so many media outlets discovered CBD in the past year media including Consumer Reports descended upon the CBD space within the last year and there's a very good reason for it because CBD starts showing up everywhere it starts showing up in coffee bars and brownies and candy and things CBD is a compound found in cannabis plants including hemp and marijuana plants CBD is like a scattershot it's there's a whole bunch of different systems that it's influencing one of which is the end of cannabinoid system but lots of others as well so this is why you see something that works for anxiety potentially for pain potentially for pediatric seizures right and wide host of things because there's a wide number of different mechanisms that it divides the scientific research has lagged is particularly in the area of CBD most of the research that's been done has been on THC which is Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and that is the primary psychoactive molecule in the plant that's responsible for feeling high more recently probably past five to ten years has there been focused on CBD or cannabidiol that's kind of the second most abundant molecule in the plant and it really came out of you know grass roots if you will of people trying it out on the ground in Colorado in other countries in England trying it out and seeing that it actually helped with pediatric epilepsy which was kind of where it got in its initial buzz one of the ways that I stayed sane honestly for the decade I tried to keep my son alive was research and so I actually had heard about cannabis for epilepsy for me when I take it it comes the anxiety or if I start to feel a headache coming on or migraine it seemed very natural that Consumer Reports wanted to step in and try to understand what is this market what are these products what are the labels say that they are are they safe are they tested do they work and how much are they and who's regulating them and that's that's where we enter into this conversation now despite promising anecdotal evidence we actually know very little about cannabidiol because there is limited research and as the chairman mentioned what we learned was a conflict between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health which prevented that research being done because it was a Schedule one drug is CBD legal so the crazy answer to that is it depends is CBD legal it depends on where you live how strange is that can you imagine not being able to buy tylenol in Ohio but you can buy it at Indiana that's that is sort of what we're talking about and we don't always understand what's the real world application like flying with CBD it seems like in a state where it's legal that you should be able to get on a plane but you may not really want to do that until it becomes federally legal what would Consumer Reports like to see happen in the CBD space to protect consumers sure so that's the most important thing that would protect consumers is clear regulatory environment alignment between the states and the federal government on all things including just the legality of possession and sales how products are manufactured how products are tested how products are sold how products are labeled and we'd also like to see more research in this space so that we the consumer has some assurance that purchasing that product will actually help treat the symptom that they're seeking my son Zack I started having seizures when he was four months old and he had had over 500,000 seizures by the time he was five and we had been through 17 pharmaceuticals he has a rare catastrophic form of early childhood epilepsy and he transitioned to hospice palliative services were you mentally preparing yourself for his death yeah I you know as a as a mom and being faced with what the situation was I and just on Facebook you know they do this memory thing that pops up and it was his EEG that was December of 2011 which was rape before we started this his EEG is of electrical scan of the brain and he was having seizure activity every 10 seconds and so you you know their little bodies and their little brains just can't keep doing that but also how can you don't quit you never quit you can't no one else is gonna fight and so at the same time of of trying to accept things the way that they were was the necessity to make sure that that didn't happen back then it was you know CBD and honey and so I gave him his first dose just in the mouth like you'd give a baby tylenol so it's a liquid he's not smoking anything and his seizures didn't start he fell asleep and two minutes pass in ten minutes pass and and his seizures didn't start and I thought you've got to be kidding me and he didn't have a seizure for 48 hours and they returned they were less frequent they were less severe but his seizures came back and so we just slowly titrate it up just like we've done for the previous decade of everything that we've dried so Zook I was almost 10 years old and incontinent and didn't know his colours and couldn't write his name and had very very poor memory so you know where he was at was he was very developmentally delayed and where is he now he is 15 years old he's toilet trained he's learning sight words so he knows his alphabet he's learning how to read he can do basic addition he's hysterical he's so funny he's so sensitive and cares about how you're feeling he's a very in a lot of ways very typical you know fifteen-year-old boy he's talking about his house he's gonna get and how I'm not gonna live with him it's just absolutely incredible it's amazing [Music] you [Music] we're here in the foothills Appalachia we're on the edge of the coal fields so we're don't have vast acres to farm we have limited acreage so we need to have a high-value crop a high-quality crop that we can grow basically for a cash crop when you talk to people who don't know anything about hemp and don't know anything about CBD how do you kind of begin to tell them about it people know that I'm growing this crop and a lot of them oh they first they automatically assume you're growing medical marijuana that's that's your first thing you have to educate people this is not medical marijuana it is it's a medical marijuana is still illegal in state of Kentucky so it isn't industrial hemp but it does produce CBD we've been primarily at the back upon the tobacco industry of course as everyone knows in decline so we've always been looking for alternatives so three years ago we actually drew our first hemp crop and and we thought this is something that could really fit in our operation and something we could produce that we would be proud to be producing that'd be Kentucky grown and like I said if you can grow something that can help a kid with epilepsy I mean that's just that's just huge it's a great feeling [Music] so when we harvest it's much like tobacco we actually go in and we hand cut it we take it and we dry it in some dryers we have here on the farm and once we dry it we actually separate the relief and bud material from the stock and that's actually a material that we have that we sell and then of course the bud material is were the CBD that and that'll go to an extractor and that's where the extraction cbda be extracted from the bud mature I feel like next year that they'll probably be more demand for him than what they're our farmers to produce what makes you say that just because of the merging markets they can't sit idle so you know next three or four years I think demand is there for in production I've covered pharmaceutical medications and over-the-counter medications and supplements for over 15 years and I have never seen any product that both has medical benefit and for very difficult to treat conditions that also may have a supplement benefit for conditions like anxiety insomnia pain and that also may be used in a recreational space is there any interest as a possible alternative or weaning mechanism for opioid addiction yes there are a number of studies that are going on that are looking at the interaction between both THC and CBD in relation to opiates and trying to see if there are some ways of curbing opiate use but not just opiates their National Institutes of Drug Abuse funded a study looking at CBD and tobacco nicotine addiction you know there's been work that's looked at cocaine addiction so all of those things I think there's potential there's theory that makes sense within this space and we'll see what happens with the research I think it's pretty exciting when I look back on that time period where I was on a lot of medications I actually had so many that my medicine cabinet was just a bunch of yellow bottles prescribed by the VA I served active duty in the Navy for four years we stepped on board the USS Harry s Truman for her maiden voyage and were the relieving battle group for the USS Cole I was injured on board the Truman actually right off the bat I tripped over the catch wire carrying roughly 180 pounds worth of tie-down chains so I basically destroyed my left knee and my lower back simultaneously when were you first prescribed opioids or opiates in 2000 when I destroyed my knee and for how long did you take them thirteen years did they work to an extent after a certain point you get moved from one type of opioid to another so I had gone from basically naproxen to tram it all to vicodin and oxy and in the end I was taking morphine tablets and for me looking back my mental state just it was like I was there but I wasn't it was just like a shell of me hi here's Veronica but she's not present she's faking it so what I made an appointment with my primary care physician at the time she actually recommended that I go out and get a card for medical marijuana and see if that was effective for me and how high did you feel I was pretty out of it for a while and that was one of the effects that I really didn't like about marijuana so I talked to some of the dispensaries about you know what can I do to kind of mitigate this feeling and they had actually suggested trying pure CBD from the hemp plant and did you feel relief immediately with the CBD I didn't really feel relief right away but I felt like after about 30 days of consistently taking it I started to feel normal again and how do you feel now today I feel alive you know I don't I don't feel like the world was coming down on top of me anymore and for me that's big I think the important thing to understand I think the hard part is the disconnect between how much is in those bottles at a dispensary or that you order online and how much is required for clinical effect now some people say I use 10 milligrams and I feel wonderful and again there's no clinical data to support that if you wanted to dose like you're seeing in the clinical trials where you actually see separation from placebo it's a lot so a few examples social anxiety 600 milligrams a day that's a lot adults with osteoarthritis of the knee or other types of pain 500 to a thousand depending on the study so I mean you're not in the tens and if you look at the bottles like some of the bottles it's like this whole bottle is 500 milligrams right it's like you're drinking that bottle in a day and that's a lot the interesting thing about one out of every four Americans has tried CBD that's according to a nationally representative survey that Consumer Reports just completed the majority of people told us CBD was effective for the problem they were trying to treat a solution to what what are they hoping to solve sure so so one of the most common reasons people have tried CBD is pain management and anxiety and insomnia [Music] I've always loved to be outside so I've always hiked and jogged and walked and running is just a great way to get outside get in the woods it's a great way to start the day feels like every day's a vacation we can get out and run before work after work you got to try to run six days a week and I had a tendinitis of my other foot and also my knee I've had a knee tendonitis and so I did the normal things rest I didn't help and then my friend that me some CBD and I didn't really intend to use it and but it was there and I you know at a couple days my tendonitis was still there and I used it and it went away immediately which was I was surprised and yeah so then I've started using it when I've had tendonitis and it seems to work and you've only used a topical ointment yes yes why haven't you tried tinctures I don't I think mostly what I've seen people use them for is anxiety and sleep disturbance which day I don't think I suffer from so I haven't really had any any I don't have any other inflammatory other than the local inflammation and that's pretty rare so you don't feel I really needed anything I'm also a little nervous a little apprehensive I I don't the topical seems like totally safe to me the ting sherry I'd like to see more information do you worry at all about trusting what's in that bottle yes yes for sure I think that at least what I've read about CBD is that's the biggest concern is what's in it who's manufacturing it where it comes from and I think with a lot of supplements when patients I've many many patients who take supplements and I tell them I think that's specially pregnant patients that's you know big risk always is that what it's what's in it things that don't have to be added to the label I think that's a scary part of supplements we wanted to do a study to really look at CBD products that were out in the market be it you know CBD oils and in containers vape oils anything really that was you know liquid CBD to see what does the market look like it and really the point is how accurately labeled by these products and in this study 70% or so of products were mislabeled some containing more CBD than was labeled in some containing less CBD that was labeled but a lot of products also contain THC or other cannabinoids in there that hadn't that weren't necessarily on the labels at all so beyond you know I'm getting less of the drug or more of the drug than I expect but I'm also getting some other things in there that I might want to be avoiding and so from a consumer standpoint it was a bit alarming I think it's very important to be a skeptic in this space especially when we're talking about this much money being spent in this space and I think it's important to you know be realistic about what we know and our approach to this and I really think bifurcating the the people that are there for medicinal use because they have an issue that can't be currently addressed with existing medications and the Wellness crowd I think we really need to differentiate those two crews and I think right now it's kind of getting blended a bit and I could see that as frustrating from the medicinal crowd because they're like hey this is we're trying to you know get this medicine or do whatever and things are getting marketed for you know more the Wellness crowd in some instances so I think it's it's pretty difficult space right now at the same time you are hopeful as a researcher and see great potential I do I do but I'm not I'm not the one that's gonna go out there and say you know it cures everything because I think it's and even seeing it in pediatric epilepsy or seeing it in anxiety it works for some and it doesn't work for and figuring that nuance out is really important but I think it's therapeutic potential is pretty wide-ranging [Music]", "sDho7zOsSNY": "hi today we're gonna talk about how to use the 99% CBD crystals [Music] now there are many ways to do it you can eat it you can vape it or you can mix it with other ingredients and we're gonna show you today how to eat it and how to mix it with other ingredients such as a carrier oil hemp seed oil or coconut oil and we're gonna try to make a recipe so that when you do it at home you know exactly what to do and how much you use of what so if you want to eat the crystals it's a kind of simple situation you just take a spoon mmm and putting them out I used to hold on to my tongue as long as I can and let it just dissolve now today we're gonna mix 99% CBD crystals with the coconut oil we want to create a 10% tincture in order to do that we'll use one gram of 99% CBD crystals and ten gram of the coconut oil all right if you want to make a stronger oil you can use double the amount of CBD for example 2 grams yeah and you will have a 20% or you can use half amount of the coconut oil you will have a stronger oil but today we're gonna make a 10% so just follow the recipe all right [Music] [Music] you can do it in oven you can do it on you know frying pan whatever just make sure to take a thermometer and measure that it's at least 70 degrees Celsius right 70 degrees Celsius I see here after 20 minutes only that it's all it's all transparent meaning that the CBD has dissolved and you can actually take it off or outside the oven or whatever you are heating it you can put it in a you know any container you want just make sure to put it in a cool place like a fridge then you can keep it for at least one year if you're gonna use it in one month or a couple of weeks you can just put it on your table doesn't matter now when the oil is like this you can cook with it you can put it on your hands you can eat it you can do many things fantasy well that's the only limitation now I stay tuned next time we're gonna show you how to baby we're waiting for some equipment so when it arrives I'm gonna show you how to do that it's also a very simple thing you're putting the device and your baby see you next time [Music] you", "5kWY3hk-Eqk": "today's the day that i introduce you to a great friend of mine a friend that i look at i respect for a long long time who has taught me so much about plant medicine botanical extracts solvent lifts extracts green element cbd this is the cbd company because this is the one that has integrity from the crack of the seed all the way to the packaging of the bottles this product right here is 100 soil king approved everything about it the manufacturers the mind behind the brands the medicinal values to the patient and our pets like this is the brand for you to look at right here i love this brand i love the people behind it let's talk about the cbd tincture why is it important what's in here what does it do it's honestly probably easier for me to tell you what's not in there so what's not in there is anything that you don't need there's a carrier oil it's organic mct oil it's coconut oil and there's full spectrum cannabinoids nothing else no no flavorings no preservatives nothing artificial no additives no isolate let's talk about cbg cbg has been nicknamed the mother of all cannabinoids and it really is the building block the plant turns into your cbd your thc and all your other your cannabinoids that are in a full spectrum product now the reason that we use full spectrum products rather than isolates is you get what's called the entourage effect which means that the parts together are more effective than any one of them by themselves so by leaving the other cannabinoids in you're getting a more effective product the cbg product differs from our cbd product because we've added a second full spectrum extract that has very high levels of cvg this gives you a different cannabinoid profile it's broader it has you know both still a high concentration of cbd and a high concentration of cbg and so you're maximizing the entourage effect shelf stability like how long does this last and you know how the carrier like talk to us about the carrier stability so any shelf stability issue with a tincture you're looking at issues with usually with the carrier oil our tinctures are 100 organic mct oil with full spectrum distillate as our cannabinoid source there's there's nothing in there that's going to spoil the rancidity issues you don't get for typically one to two years on mct oil as long as you keep it i wouldn't store it in a hot car you don't need to refrigerate it it's in a in a dark bottle shouldn't have any problems let's talk about our beloved family members our furry friends our furry friends you have two different varieties right here you have a 1200 milligrams and a 400 milligrams you want to explain the two of those they're the same product it's just a different dosage the 400 typically would be for a smaller animal ranging anywhere from a cat or a really small dog up to like a 30 or 40 pound dog 1200 milligram is targeted to larger animals and that comes from me personally having a large dog and seeing how fast you burn through a lot of these products it's a much higher potency so your bottle lasts a lot longer so how do people find the test results like how do we know that like so every one of our products if you pick it up and look on it there's a qr code on the back of it and if you scan that it'll take you straight to a test results page on our website on that page we provide test results for every batch every product we make and we're not just providing the potency results that most manufacturers do at the end of the manufacturing process we provide the results of the material we intake of the the crude extracts of the finished distillate when we refine the extract and of the finished product and at every step of the of the way we're testing potency we're testing for pesticides we're testing for solvents and we're testing for heavy metals so when you get one of our products you know that it's tested start to finish gunner come here buddy so if you have a pet or a dog and the nose is always dry you see how his nose is dry you're good boy you just put this on it rub it in a little bit look at that moistened it right up there's no regulation that tells you you have to do that high quality of testing you do that because of who you are and the integrity within correct because it's the right thing to do because i wouldn't consume a product that didn't have that level of testing behind it and that's specifically why we started the company was because we couldn't find products with that level of testing and transparency that were remotely affordable to use that's good that's a good line he just said because he couldn't find products so he had to do it himself what's the difference in quality from this product for our pets and this product for our humans one has a green lid the other one has a brown lid that's literally the only difference that in dosage human grade pro humid grade ingredients in both of them integrity integrity integrity 100 percent soil king approved product and that's the reason why right there why would you give garbage to your pets yet feed you something superior make if you love your pet like i love my pet there should be no difference should be absolutely no different unfortunately in a lot of different industries especially the hemp industry you're gonna find products that are pushed on our animals that are not consumable to humans and it's disgusting and it's not regulated and it's okay it's not okay with me and it's not okay with doug well i'm glad you got the opportunity to understand what i see in doug and what he's been doing for a number of years for medicinal patients i'm proud to have him sitting here right now with me and i'm also proud to be a brand ambassador of this great product for more information on the full array of products that green element cbd has available for you you can go to their website at www.greenelementcbd.com there you'll find a whole list of products we have some lip balms sap sticks you know topicals there's a roll-on pain creams and this incredible lotion right here that is just absolutely the smell and scent of this is just smells so good doug you can find a lot of information about what's in the product the integrity behind the product you can go to the website you can find out more information about all these products what's coming in the future but more importantly is the claims and the analytics and the testing that go alongside with these products you'll find all on the website as well too that's why i love a product like this because they stand behind it 100 you as a consumer and a patient can trust that you're going to get what they tell you you're going to", "9nBimiqnPnU": "hey guys welcome to my channel my name is valerie and today i thought i would do a little chat about cbd and review some products from a company called bluebird botanicals so if you're interested in that stick around i wanted to start this video with a brief description of what cbd is in case anybody needs a little background information cbd is the abbreviation for cannabidiol which is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis cannabis is an umbrella term for a plant family that includes both marijuana and hemp the main differences between marijuana and hemp is that marijuana contains high levels of thc hemp contains higher levels of cbd so the products we'll be talking about in this video today are cbd that is derived from hint the farm bill of 2018 basically legalized cbd that is derived from hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent thc cbd can help with things like anxiety insomnia it can help with pain relief and a whole bunch of other ailments i mostly use it for feelings of anxiousness and nervousness so let's talk a little bit about this brand bluebird botanicals when i first started researching cbd something i heard over and over again was make sure you check out the company that you're getting your cbd from especially if you're doing something like tinctures or gummies or pills you're ingesting the product so you want to make sure that the company is doing everything they can to keep their consumers safe so i did a lot of research about a lot of different brands and this one kept popping up and it checked off all of the boxes that i was looking for in a cbd brand according to their website bluebird botanicals is a family-owned business that has been around since 2012. their products are vegan and cruelty free and grown in the u.s they are certified by the u.s hemp authority and they are also a certified b corporation they use the co2 extraction method to get the cbd out of the hemp plant they also do third party lab testing and most of their products come with a certificate of analysis their website has a batch database all of their products will have a batch number and also a qr code and you can scan that and it will take you right to the batch database to look up the certificate analysis on that particular product the certificate of analysis will tell you things like the potency and also whether any toxins or chemicals were detected so it's really great information like i said for the the products that you're going to be putting into your body okay so let's talk a little bit about these products i wanted to very lightly dipped my toe into cbd when i first started so bluebird botanicals has a cbd isolate that is thc free it comes in a little one ounce bottle which retails for 79.95 however i found coupon codes and they have sales all the time on their website so i actually got this 50 off which made it not so bad a serving size is approximately 0.5 milliliters and that contains 25 milligrams of cbd i decided to start at 10 milligrams about 0.25 milliliters just to test it out and see what i noticed on it i didn't notice any changes at the 0.25 milliliters or about 10 milligrams i tried that for a few days and then i decided to up it to the serving suggestion which is the 0.5 milliliters or 25 milligrams of cbd so this is something that you're not going to notice an immediate effect with it's more of a gradual thing so the first time that i noticed it was working i was laying in this bed reading a book and i reached over to the bedside table to grab a full glass of water and i fumbled it and the water went everywhere it went behind the bedside table it soaked a um a power strip it soaked a power strip down there completely slipped it went all over my phone so i get up i go get a towel i come back i clean it all up i get another glass of water i sit back down in bed and i start reading my book again like a few seconds later mid paragraph i stopped reading and i was like holy [ __ ] this stuff is working because prior to being on cbd if that had happened it would have been a total [ __ ] show i would have freaked out i would have been terrified that i was going to get electrocuted by that soaked power strip i would have been worried that my phone was completely destroyed a pain in the ass now i have to move the dresser and get the water out behind it i definitely would have cussed which i did not do and i was like oh my god this stuff is really working i was almost shocked so anyway i was really happy with it um i actually finished the bottle so i went back to bluebird botanicals website because now i was interested in trying a full spectrum cbd to see if there was something to this entourage effect so the entourage effect is a term that's used to describe a bunch of different cannabinoids working together to enhance the effectiveness of the cbd so i picked up this bottle from bluebird from bluebird botanicals of their organic cbd oil it's a one ounce bottle that retails for 49.95 again i was able to find a coupon code and get it for 50 off so this one is a full spectrum cbd oil which means it's not thc free but it's still legal it's under the 0.3 percent amount one thing to keep in mind about full spectrum is that it has terpenes terpenes are what gives hemp the aroma that distinct aroma and also flavor so this one tastes very different from the thc free the thc free you basically only taste the carrier oil that they put it with which is mct oil and i think also i don't know if there's coconut oil in it or not but it's very un it's not offensive at all this one's pretty strong so i usually hold them under my tongue for about 30 seconds and then swallow it i tried this one for about two weeks and i didn't i didn't really notice it working as well as the thc free which i thought was really weird because i thought the entourage effect was going to be like 10 times better and it really wasn't for me so i ended up going back to the thc free and i bought this two ounce bottle that they offer around the time that i went to buy more cbd bluebird botanicals was offering a 70 off sale on their cbd lotion so i kind of thought why not so the two lotions that i got are 3.4 fluid ounces and they retail for 39.96 like i said it was 70 off so they were about 12 a bottle so i picked this one up it's the hemp silk softening and beautifying lotion i like to put lotion on my hands and feet in the winter right before bed so the um lotion that i was using prior to this was an aromatherapy lavender lotion that was supposed to help you relax and go to sleep at night so they tell you to rub it vigorously between your hands and then take a few deep breaths you know to help calm yourself before bed so i guess i was in the habit of that so i put this stuff on did that took a big breath let me warn you if you don't like the smell of hemp or pot or um if you're not used to it this will knock you on your ass i was not prepared for this i thought it would be like a a pretty lotion smell it's not it smells like hemp which is it's okay if you're used to it or even if you like it but for me it was a little bit too strong right before bed i've used it a few times it does help with moisturization so if you like the smell um i didn't really notice any effects as far as the cbd was concerned the other lotion i picked up is the cbd sport lotion i got this one more as like a little stocking stuffer for my husband for christmas because he is a very active guy and he was having some trouble with his elbow so i thought maybe this might help so he gave me his review on it that i will pass along to you and he says that it's sort of like taking an aspirin you have a lessening of the pain or a slight relief from the pain after applying the lotion to the area that you are having trouble with it also has wild mint which kind of hides that really strong hemp flavor so those are all of the products that i've purchased from bluebird botanicals i just want to say if you haven't tried cbd and you are having feelings of anxiousness nervousness this stuff has been life-changing for me i am so much calmer on this stuff one benefit that i've noticed is that i sleep a little deeper at night i'm a very light sleeper and i've noticed since i've started taking this that i don't wake up as many times during the night i also tend to get uh agitated i guess irritated i don't know when like people tap their feet or tap their fingers or my husband is a fidgeter and i am constantly you know when we're in the couch when we're in the couch when we're on the couch watching tv or something i'm constantly like stop stop stop moving stop whatever and he says i'm not doing that as much i hadn't even realized that that was just another benefit he told me just a couple days ago that i was not i guess nitpicking on little repetitive things like that so hey good yay anyway i highly recommend trying out cbd because if you are not an anxious overall nervous person you can't imagine how much calmer you can be on this stuff it's really done wonders for me so hopefully you found some good information in this video i'll link all these products down below just in case anybody's interested in looking at them they're not affiliate links or anything like that it's just links to bloopers websites so i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope you have a great rest of your day thanks bye", "s2CjXD4ebJ4": "welcome you guys welcome back to my channel for those that are new here hi my name is Rochelle and I like to make thrifting and fashion videos along with a little bit of beauty and just sharing my life with you guys over here on my little corner of the internet for today's video I'm super excited because a really amazing beauty brand ended up reaching out to me and asking me if I wanted to try some other products so I checked him out and it was actually funny because I was looking at this brand when I was recently at Ulta and thought how cute and how I never like notice that brand before and it is truly beauty so thank you so much truly beauty for sponsoring this video they sent over the cutest little package I can't wait to show you guys with all of these really nice little goodies there is a acne jelly cleanser a face mask a body butter some little like breakout dots and then a glow serum so I figured today we would just talk about all the different products and like try them out do a first impressions see if they're worth the hype they seem super nice I posted them earlier and a bunch of you guys like wrote on my Instagram stories and said that I looked really cute and that you guys were interested in them too so I'm so excited to do this video if you guys are interested in truly beauty and a bunch of new skin care that has CBD benefits let's go ahead and get red on into this video are you guys so I figured I would just do a first impressions just because I actually haven't ever tried anything from truly beauty and I am really interested in a bunch of the stuff I have been looking at it over the last few days since having this package and I'm so excited to try this stuff out you guys they look so cute I'm really excited so I figured I would just go like in order of what I would apply on my face and body so this first one right here is the CBD jelly this is an anti acne facial cleanser it has 200 milligrams of CBD say silic acid watermelon agave nectar and vitamin A so this will be a light exfoliant but then the watermelon and like the agave is going to be very moisturizing so I do seem to really prefer kind of like jelly type facial cleansers and I also feel like this one is so big like how much product is in here Oh a ounces does say here too is vegan clean high-performing animal cruelty free fresh and made in the USA so all those claims are also really really nice let's smell this I like to smell everything you guys it has kind of like a um almost like a evergreen kind of scent to me I feel like it's almost like not pine something that's like a green kind of scent so yeah there is the face wash right there after washing my face I will just apply this truly golden leaf resurface and brighten CBD face mask it is an antioxidant rich formula to firm and clarify skin it has 300 milligrams of CBD glycolic acid and AJ and phas so that usually does resurface your skin I realized the packaging of this one how it comes in like this big squeezy tube I don't think I have any other masks that come in a packaging like that so that'll be fun and interesting after that they have these really cute little breakouts acne patches one of my best friends Amy actually uses these little acne patches and she swears by them I think the kind that she gets is on like Amazon or something but I never tried them and she swears that they make your acne go away overnight so these ones are really cute because they are just little they just have the little leaves on there so they're really cute and fun and there is 36 in this pack I actually do have a little break out kind of like on my chin area and so I'll try that on it obviously won't be able to show you guys the results until tomorrow so I'll just probably put it in the description box of this video like how I felt it looked in the morning they also have this cute little unicorn CBD whipped body butter it's so crazy it's kind of like a rainbow moosie looking sherbert in there it looks so pretty in the little packaging I don't know if you guys can see I'll show you guys later and then they also have this really cute little this is what I was really looking at while I was in Ulta that caught my eye it is called mary-jane CBD glow serum it has a vitamin A which I'm pretty sure is a retinoid cannabis sativa caffeine and glycolic acid and just like this really pretty purple color and it looks like it has like a little dropper there as far as just like aesthetically I definitely give this brand a 10 out of 10 are you guys I'm gonna take off my makeup I'm just gonna use a little makeup light and then I'm just gonna wet my face I'm gonna try to wash my face as much right here but I probably will just have to like rinse my face off all the way at the sink I usually always remove my makeup either with a makeup wipe or like a cleansing balm is to get most of the makeup off before actually washing my face because I don't want the face wash to just be like removing the makeup I want the face wash to actually with cleaning my skin so I always do a double cleanse so it just says morning and night massage one to two pumps onto wet skin and rinse I have a little wet washcloth just to kind of wet my face I do like that I think I did about one and a half pumps there oh it's a little bit like almost slightly not sticky but like it is kind of like a jelly consistency and like I said it does have like a very evergreen or like I don't know kind of like a it sounds weird to say foresty scent but like a very evergreen type of scent it's going to go over to the sink and rinse this off really fast you guys as I was washing my face off I was thinking why didn't I not make a tik-tok doing this routine while I was filming this video you guys I've been trying to learn tik-tok some of my friends are on it and they're so cute and it's so addictive I have only posted like two and honestly I'm not very good at it so I'm trying to Bing so I've been trying to get a little bit better at it it's not intuitive to me at all and like all young people are so good at it I don't know where I've been it been living at her under a rock but yeah I made a tick-tock I should have done one for this maybe I will in the next few days anyways my face is all fresh and clean it does feel nice and clean like my skin feels like you know when your skin just feels really like not tight but kind of like it just feels like it's clean there's no makeup on it and it does feel rather soft just feels really really good and then next I'm going to try the mask it says on cleansed dry skin apply a thin layer and leave on for 15 to 30 minutes for a maximum the hydration before wiping off I'll put it on the back of my hand so that you guys can kind of see what it looks like okay so it's like light and creamy it looks kind of like it's like a almost like a really pale green kind of color my nose it smells lightly herbal as well so I'm just going to put this all over my skin when I'm applying it it feels very creamy and it doesn't have that much color to it when you share it out onto your skin I just kind of avoided the eye area but put it pretty much everywhere else I'm just gonna let this sit on my skin for about 15 minutes and then I'll check back in with you guys oh one of my friends on Instagram actually just messaged me and told me that she's been wanting to try out this entire line and to let her know how they work I love it when you guys definitely like respond to what I'm trying out on my channel it like makes me feel good because sometimes I'm interested in stuff and you guys aren't necessarily interested in it so it makes me feel good when you guys are also interested in like all the products that I like actually you guys now that I have applied the face mask I figure we can do this because this the body butter so this is the unicorn cvd whipped body butter it's a tongue-twister whipped body butter but I can't say whipped body butter it has 300 milligrams of CBD matcha cannabis sativa acai and a collagen boost look how cute this is stop it it looks like like it's like the top of a rainbow cupcake or something so cute and it smells so good it smells like it's definitely like a sweet kind of vanilla it almost smells like a cupcake you guys oh it smells so good I almost like it feels sad ruining it since it's so cute in there oh it's such an interesting like consistency it's almost like oh my gosh it's so weird know how to describe it it's not like a cream cream it's almost like a I don't know ooh now it's really creamy it was almost like a weird consistency when I first took it out but then when you rub it in it is a very creamy oh my gosh it's almost like this is definitely such an interesting product smell this mmm mmm can you smell anything you smell so let me eat it you smell like stuff done I know doesn't it smell like almost like a cupcake or something probably really good for your cuticles or like your elbows and like calluses on like your feet you know how your feet get really like cows in the summertime I feel like this body butter is like perfect for that kind of thing like elbows and knees it's been probably about a half hour that census mask has been marinating and I feel so good I also really noticed when I was looking up close at the mask there was like little like glitter particles or I thought it was glitter so I was like it's that weird like I thought it was maybe coming from my washcloth but I realized in here it says that it has 24 karat gold mica in here so it has like a little tiny like gold flecks on your skin when you put the mask on which I feel like was cute I don't know if it does anything but I feel like it makes your skin look nice and like moisturise so I'm just gonna take it off really fast I definitely feel like that mask did moisturize my skin a lot I like it really moisturizing mask because I have very dry skin especially in the winter time so it is really nice to have like just like the creamy thick it almost feels like like a sleeping mask kind of thing honestly does feel so soft and smooth and just like just like new skin put on the serum next let's see what this says okay after cleansing and toning apply four to five drops onto a dry face neck and chest before other skin care products so this is like a little light purple kind of color and then it does have the little like dropper ampule going to apply some to both cheeks and my forehead ooh okay it's interesting it's kind of like serum II but also slightly creamier than I was expecting like for some reason I thought it was gonna be even more like lightweight but it does feel very a little bit more like dense which is nice seeming to absorb into my skin really nicely smells good this one doesn't smell as herbal it's kind of like a little bit of like a light maybe powder kind of scent so there is my skin with all of the serum kind of like sunken into my skin I feel like my skin looks really really nice I'm like really impressed you guys so I'm excited excited to use this stuff more okay and then here is the little breakout acne patches they do say that they're non-drying and they protect for faster healing the CBD patches visibly show it's working by absorbing pus and fluids interesting I'm excited apply to the blemish and leave on overnight to have impurities extracted in the bottom bar I will put kind of like what my results are from tomorrow are really really thin like little tiny stickers actually I haven't had like a breakout in a while so it's perfect timing to get these I will say they're kind of hard to like peel up because of little like leaves they're kind of hard to peel up it's gonna be weird to talk to Everett with this at my face all night very easy to stick on so yeah that's what it looks like it just sticks right on I probably wouldn't put this on until like right before I'm going to bed so honestly I'll probably take this off just to do the intro because I feel funny doing my outro with this but I figured I'd just show you guys kind of like what they look like once they are on are you guys so to sum up my final thoughts on truly I am like so impressed with this brand new guys honestly I'm so excited to continue to use these in the future I'm very very ritualistic about my skincare routine and one of my friends is like not all one time she said she put on moisturizer and she was like wow my face is so soft and I'm like wait you don't do skincare every day like I'm kind of crazy that way but I was so impressed I honestly don't have that many cons to say about everything truly I really liked the jelly cleanser I liked the smell of it that it did kind of have that like I don't know kind of like pine or like evergreen kind of scent it felt really nice and I feel like there is a ton of product in here the construction of all of the bottles and jars and everything just seemed really high-quality like all of the finishes are very very nice this little guy was so creamy and just made my skin feel like so soft afterwards this is definitely a really good product if you have really really dry skin and if you just need kind of like a moisturizing mask I would definitely do this while like watching Netflix before bed probably like once a week really good and again I feel like it has a ton of product in there that's gonna last me forever because you really don't use that much the little unicorn CBD body butter smells amazing if you like the smell of like sprinkled cupcakes or like funfetti cake it smells so good and it was just like so amoliant like you can still see on my hand that it was just so moisturizing super nice this little glow serum a super cute really nice just has such a nice finish on my skin and I feel like it absorbed in my sand really quickly and like I said I can't tell you guys the results of this because I haven't really tried them for long enough but I feel like my friends love these little things so I'm hoping that it really helped get rid of this little acne spot so that it will go away and I can film tomorrow with a clean fresh face so thank you so much truly for reaching out to me now I'm like low-key interested in all of your other products like all of the

stores the chain is joining a growing list of national retailers including Walgreens and CVS that are beginning to stock their shelves with cannabis infused creams bombs and oils so joining us now to discuss is actor and comedian turned entrepreneur Tommy Chong who runs his own line of cannabis products through his brand Chung's choice Tommy thanks so much for taking the time I want to ask you first what you think about the move for another big-box store like a Kroger jumping into the CBD space well they're all jumping on the bandwagon you know it's it's you know that train has left the station and so they might as well jump on or else they're going to get left behind well you just one of many I want to ask you that because you sell both these products you sell you sell THC products you also sell CBD products through Chung's choice when you look at the demand for both sides of your product offerings what do you see in terms of who is using what and which one is becoming more popular well I guess the CBD or oils you know because they can hit everybody you know and it's you it's a it's a medicine that prevents you from getting sick as well as helping with with elements that you already have and so and and really the THC there's a little bit of THC in all the CBD products so everybody's getting a little THC as well which is also good good for you you know so marijuana has been a medicine for thousands of years and we're just finding that out now and it's going to get bigger by the way yeah there has been some issue with with some of that in terms of testing these things when we have seen some companies marketing only CBD oil and some other things in there we heard that at the FDA hearing a couple weeks ago that was a problem I mean when we're talking about regulation are you surprised at how things have been going because we just saw Texas governor Greg Abbott signing awhile legalizing industrial hemp in the state of Texas do you think that things are moving quicker now yeah yeah well it's about time you know I mean like Kentucky for instance used to be the biggest hemp producers in the world and they should get back into it too you know it's a medicine and it's always been in medicine and and it's a very lucrative medicine to it which is by the way which is one of the reasons that DuPont and the people that try to eliminate hemp because it was so effective in in so many ways you know I mean just think about the hemp products that could be helping the world right now instead of but having a you know horrible timeless plastics it was DuPont the plastic people that wanted to get rid of hemp and and we had hemp paper we had we would have had him plastic by now had we kept going on the hemp train so we're just coming around to where we should have been got it yeah so we mentioned CVS they've gone into offering hemp type products CBD products but also Kroger what you're talking about right now but why are you offering this is it because consumers have requested this kind of product or is it because it's such a big revenue driver and that's the hope well no it's the consumers wanted you know when you find something that works you know like especially it helps you sleep at night it helps calms you down it works on the brain see how the products works on the brain and it calms the bringing down and it invigorates the brain that's why so many creative people you know the rappers the artists the musicians the whole music world depends on on CBD and hemp products may ask how much you think CBD is just a commodity and you can buy any CBD or how much is the brand and the the CBD is going to be important well everything has it's really good really bad products the the worst product would be no CBD but you know they're advertising there's a damage or whatever yeah yeah and so so the the purity of the product really the consumer really has to decide that the consumer when they when they jump on something that works then they'll go all over you know the country looking for it like that's why Chung's choice my product is in demand it's a little pricey but it's pure we make sure that you know we get it all tested properly and we make sure that our product is good because it is medicine you don't want to mess with medicine no tell me let me ask you this last question too though because you do mention it how many different people are now pumping CBD products and and signed on to these deals of course you know there's there's a bunch of people out there as you mentioned that athletes getting paid to endorse these things the musicians getting paid to endorse these things so there's not like there's not a financial incentive for them to be pumping out these products as well but for someone who's been in the cannabis space for so long are you just are you kind of mad that you're seeing celebrities jump on this train now as well after you had paved the way in the cannabis space not at all more the merrier man the more the merrier my biggest thrill in life was when Sanjay Gupta got on CNN and showed the world that marijuana and CBD and the oils help a little little girl with epilepsy now that was the biggest thrill in my life when I saw that no I the more the merrier everybody's walking", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "08qTKHI26Uc": "when people see CBD or they see a marijuana leaf or a hemp leaf they automatically assume drugs you know illegal activity and that's not the case with this type of product this this product is supposed to be presented in a more medicinal way what's it like to be on the ground floor of a new industry that few people fully understand welcome to the business of CBD the CBD superstore in Queens New York actually used to be a vape shop but a few years ago the owner saw the potential in CBD and gradually started changing his business originally we started off with a couple of products that we tested ourselves some for anxiety some for pain and we saw the growing popularity of the product and the results that customers were getting and before you know it it just it grew into a full blown-out CBD business though this company this is actually a specific facial serum yeah CBD infuse but it has some great ingredients in it my name is Nick Aragon EC I own CBD superstore here in Whitestone New York and what we do here is provide high quality pharmaceutical grade CBD products to our consumers but the jar the jars are those jars the seven gram jars are forty-five but the ones that we have loose those are fifty four seven grams don't necessarily get caught up with the strongest only because every strain could affect you differently in a better way so just because something says 20% doesn't mean you might not get great results from a 16% the Sun sets 19.5 the juicy fruit is 16.7 this is 7 grams that comes in a jar or you can get 14 grams which is doubled so in the beginning obviously there was a stigma you know people thought that when they heard hemp and they heard CBD it was automatically a marijuana product it was an intoxicating product and that really wasn't the case the fact is that we actually had some kickback from community people who actually thought we were a dispensary or we were opening up a marijuana dispensary in selling marijuana and you know the police department came in and we spoke to them and we spoke to the community groups Whitestone itself as a conservative community you know it's a family-oriented community so our job was to actually inform them and send out you know mailers to everybody's homes and reach out to the civic associations to explain what the product was how it works and how it does not conflict with any type of illegal substance that's on the market today unlike marijuana which comes from cannabis plants containing high levels of the psychoactive compound THC CBD is derived from him a different variety of cannabis with very low levels of THC that won't get you high despite its many uses the hemp variety of cannabis has been mostly illegal for decades due to its close relationship to marijuana but last year the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp production CBD products are still in a legal gray area and potentially subject regulations the brightfield group an industry analyst estimates that in three years the CBD market could hit 22 billion dollars everybody was looking at the THC version of cannabis thinking that that's going to be where the real market is is people wanting adult use cannabis for recreational purposes you know fast forward to the hemp legalization in the 2018 farm bill and all the sudden everybody realizes wow we can put him derive CBD and just about everything under the Sun the companies kind of did this pivot and thought well of course we want to have this THC type of cannabis product but we might be able to make big big money having something really mainstream that could be sold on Amazon or even a Walmart typical would be a oral ingestion of either a tincture or a capsule all comes out the gummies different types of gummies dog treats we have isolates we have fruits shoes it's not necessarily the cure-all for everything it's not a miracle type of product you know we market the product as a natural relief while new products seem to be hitting the shelves of stores like NYX each week CBDs actual health benefits are still being studied now that hemp is legal and CBDs popularity has exploded a flood of new products claiming CBD content has hit the market the challenge for Nick is figuring out what's actually good you know obviously I would still buy them from you if you got them but we need to know where they come from well not by here I said you have to really talk to the farm owners you have to talk to the manufacturers and you have to talk to the companies you have to see how their products are being made how they're being sourced you also have to confirm that there are third-party lab results so there's no conflict of interest of companies testing their own products and that's been the problem for the consumers they don't know whether they're getting a good CBD product or a bad CBD product you know we need to know the cannabinoid profile in these products prior to getting them we need to know it has a medicinal benefit that's our job in the industries to be able to prove to a customer the validity of the product and the legitimacy of the company that we're buying from hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over

again five different types of CBD\nthat you need to know about if you're looking for CBD in your skincare hi my\nname is Christy and I've been treating a client's I'm a licensed professional\ntreating clients with acne hyperpigmentation and other skin\nconditions for over twelve years and now I have taken early retirement from\npractice and I'm only doing online consultations so if you're interested in\nthat there is a link below you can just find out more information to see if you\nare the right candidate so moving on we're gonna be talking about the five\ndifferent types of CBD so if you haven't caught any of our series of what we're\ntalking about beauty and skincare I do want to clarify because I only mentioned\nit in one video that CBD is not the same as hemp seed oil so the CBD is actually\nextracted from the cannabis sativa plant so there are two totally different\nthings so we're gonna be talking about the CBD as an extract in your skincare\nso the first one is CBD isolate and this is actually consisting of 99% CBD it is\nTHC which is the hallucinogenic agent free it's very consistent of most of the\nmanufacturers that use CBD in their products uses the CBD isolate and all\nother plant actives are eliminated so the next one is CBD distillate and this\none is not as concentrated it's still 80% CBD the other is rest is other minor\ncannabinoids and terpenes and all the other rest of it is plant materials and oils okay so the next one is full-spectrum\nCBD and that consists of 60% CBD and 0.3 percent THC it also is taken from the\nentire plan including the flower so it does have the plant flavinoids the it\nhas the minor cannabinoid such as CBC CBD\nand CBG as well as other phytochemicals so I do have one caveat I've read\nseveral different articles and I read some that come across that say the CBD\nisolate which is the 99% is more effective and then I also have read that\nthis full-spectrum CBD is more beneficial so there seems to be I don't\nknow if it's conflicting or they just have difference of opinion but just to\nlet you know that when you start reading literature on CBD those are some of the\nthings that you might come across so before we get into the last CBD type if\nyou're finding this information helpful please give us a thumbs up and like this\nvideo letting us know that this is the type of information that you are looking\nfor and don't forget to hit that notification bell to let you know when\nour videos come up we would love it if you would subscribe to us so now let's\nget to our last CBD type so the last one is water soluble CBD in our last video\nwe talked about the fact that the CBD is actually naturally lipophilic meaning\nthat it loves oil or oil soluble well when they make it water soluble what\nthey do is they basically shrink down the molecule so that it actually can\nmix with water but when you do or you mix anything with water it can dilute\nthe potency and in this case it can dilute the potency up to 30% so here\ncomes the pro tip when you see hemp seed extract it's more than likely hemp seed\noil and don't mistake the fact that there's only trace amounts if any of the\nCBD in hemp seed oil so it is not the same thing so now that we talked about\nthe five types of CBD we're gonna briefly talk about what skin condition\nworks best with some of these different types\nnow the links of some of these studies will be in my blog in which the blog\nlink will be in my description okay so the first one is acne so there was a\nstudy in 2014 in which they found that CVD\nactually reduces the amount of lipid that is being produced from the SIBO\nsites and that's basically the cells that create the sebum and then in study\ndone in 2016 and actually showed in addition to that it actually reduced\ninflammation in the sebocytes and inflammation throughout the skin and in\naddition to that and also they also found antimicrobial and antibacterial\nproperties which then also can help with fungus related skin diseases as well as\nacne so for those of you who have sensitive skin or dry and sensitive skin\nor just dry skin you may want to listen up to this part so they have found that\nthe full-spectrum CBD that we just talked about with its powerful\nphytochemicals and flavinoids can actually help reduce not only\ninflammation but it has the essential fatty acids that a lot of the lipid poor\nso basically dry skin is lacking it can help serve as an emollient and\na moisturizer with these essential fatty acids of antioxidants and the\nphytochemicals a lot of times the types of products that you will see the full\nspectrum CBD is in oils such as massage oils salves\nbalms lotions and creams so some of the skin conditions that are lacking a lot\nof the lipids or essential fatty acids CBDs actually has omega-6 and Gamma\nlinoleic acid which can help for those of you who have psoriasis eczema and\nsystemic sclerosis I mentioned in an earlier video that also has by\nantioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E so it can help neutralize the\nfree radicals and there was actually a study that was done that actually helped\nwound healing cells so basically helped healing of\nwounds including acne lesions so this is by no means an exhaustive list of all\nthe benefits of it and what you can do with it what skin types obviously this\nis just to better help you read the label of your skincare products because\nremember makeup is an art and skincare is a science thanks for watching and\ndon't forget to

the oil that's found in marijuana sort of I mean it sounds familiar can you get high off of CBD oil No maybe no I don't believe so ooh CBD oil legal in all 50 states I don't know no I don't know I would I don't know no I don't think it is its CBD oil the same thing as medical marijuana no maybe no is attempt is CBD oil safe to give to kids and pets I don't know I guess I haven't research enough to know the answer to that I would definitely give it to a kid what does CBD oil do why do people take it oh not no not that I could put into words really don't know how it works I don't know it's like it takes the edge off or something I I don't know how to explain it I would say like pain relief and or stress relief but that's guessing sounds like there's still a few things that people don't know or have questions about on CBD oil so let's go talk to dr. Johnny Boden to get the answers I'm dr. Johnny Bowden I'm a board certified nutritionist and an author I think the biggest misconceptions about CBD come from its confusion with marijuana from which it is completely chemically distinct the difference between CBD orell and marijuana is not really a fair comparison it's like saying the difference between vitamin C and an apple an apple has vitamin C but there are different categories CBD is a cannabinoid there are about a hundred known cannabinoids and they exist in many different plants let me say unequivocably that you cannot repeat cannot get high on CBD if that's what you're taking it for you're going to be sorely disappointed so the endocannabinoid system is this ancient system in humans and in vertebrates that regulates all kinds of really interesting processes that people care about such as digestion and sleep and and people of reading all that research and they're interested in getting some stimulation of the system that regulates all these wonderful things and I think that's why they're interested in in CBD all that far aliens entrance into this market is very very significant and here's why they've been oil manufacturers for thirty years they know how to extract oils that are have what they're supposed to have in them and have purity and our essayed for all those things and i think their entrance into this is a very important event and makes it possible for people to try it that might have been hesitant before not knowing who's making [Music] you", "O6-wdJagsYk": "just want to say this upfront this is not a sponsored video so there's not going to be any discount codes or anything of that nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "NIoL4dXuuE4": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a hemp body butter [Music] CBD topical butters creams and lotions are used for a variety of medicinal reasons and today we'll be showing you how to make one of the easiest options an infused body butter body butter is a thick buttery moisturizer and when infused with cannabis will not only help with rejuvenating dry skin but will also provide relief from inflammation and pain now at its core this product recipe only needs two ingredients hemp and cocoa butter although optionally to soften the texture or to add an aroma you can include coconut oil as well as essential oils but I'll get to that in a little bit so to start you'll need to use a pound of cocoa butter for every ounce of hemp here I'm using half a pound of cocoa butter with half an ounce of buds that just finished drying I'm just leaving most of the plant intact because I'm lazy but I'd recommend chopping up the buds first so that the smaller pieces have an easier time of infusing with the butter and then adding it in after the cocoa butter melts now put it over a double boiler wait for the cocoa butter to melt [Music] and then use a spoon to submerge the temp into the butter before letting it sit for two hours be sure to top off the water in the pot if needed and now two hours later the CBD the buds are infused with the butter we'll need to take out the plant material from the butter and for that I'm using a strainer along with a coffee filter typically for consumables I'll use a cheesecloth instead of a coffee filter as they'll work much faster but because I'm going to be using the butter as a topical and not as a consumable I want to make sure that I catch all of the tiny plant particles so I went with a slower but more effective option once it's almost done I'll give it a good squeeze to get the last of the butter through and now as is this will work as a basic body butter although we still need to wait for it to cool down and solidify you can leave it for a day to solidify on its own in a cool dark place or to quicken the process I just put it in the refrigerator and a few hours later we have a solid block of infused cocoa butter because of how solid cocoa butter is when you wanna use it as is you'll need to break off a piece of it and then rub it into the skin cocoa butter has a melting point of just below the human body temperature so it will slowly melt when rubbed over the skin to make things easier you can always use something to make the pieces smaller like a cheese grate however if you want a body butter that's easier to work with then a simple solution is to mix it with coconut oil which is a lot softer and has a lower melting point of around room temperature to do this I'm using one part infused butter along with one part coconut oil and put it back on the double boiler because this does dilute the CBD content in the body butter you can use double attempt when making the butter or use the same process of combining temp with coconut oil to make an infuse coconut oil as well before mixing the two [Music] [Music] now once both have melted just give it a quick stir take it off the heat and when it's warm to the touch here's where you can also add essential oils if you want to change the aroma of the body butter I personally like the natural coconut and chocolatey scent so I left it as is but there are a lot of ways to complement these smells such as with coffee or peppermint finally storing a cool place for it to solidify and now you have a softer and quicker melting infused body butter and that's it", "7GsqZ41yF_o": "[Music] this is a review of shikkai cbd body lotion i sent it to two labs to see if it's real why don't blindly trust cbd companies plenty of investigations have shown that some of them lie even if they give you a lab test that's why i blind test at two labs i also did a little background check on this guy something you might not like here that's coming up let's see the lab test what's in it the strength the cost breakdown in my opinion which is worthless just pay attention to the lab results and what i found they claim you get 750 milligrams of cbd for just 40 bucks if you're watching this on youtube you can support these free lab tests just by watching my video the full video like or share the official lab tests are here at cbdxamen.com i do use affiliate links on my website but this video is only intended to show you the lab results i don't link to my website this is not sponsored i bought the product i paid for the lab test don't shut me down again youtube please okay 750 claimed milligrams of cbd that is our labs found 11 to 15 more cbd b score that's okay they claim pure cbd from isolate the labs say shikhai is correct don't worry about that trace level of cbtv there it's in most pure cbd products it's good it's so low anyway that lab b doesn't even show it let me break down the strength in just a second here this is 4.8 cents per milligram of cbd pure cbd oils type you put in your mouth go for about 7.5 cents on average so you got a topical lotion here with cbd in it for a great deal under 5 cents i was actually surprised because i found this bottle in whole foods and that's not very whole foods pricing of you shikai but uh then i saw that chica also has products in walmart and i said okay it makes sense now that it's a little cheap cheap cheap it's got a bunch of natural ingredients but here's where the problem lies no pun intended a couple of these ingredients can be naturally derived but they can also be synthetically made they are super common ingredients considered safe however in large doses one can be toxic one is classified as an irritant another is a low risk skin allergen not a big deal i mean they're used in thousands of everyday products but i thought this was a natural brand i'm here in california this brand has been around for 50 years it grew a reputation for all natural skin care products unfortunately they used that type of natural marketing when they were a little less than natural selling unnatural ingredients and the ftc forced them to stop doing that they also have a class action lawsuit over the misleading advertising so i don't always bring up common skin care ingredients but in this case a lot of people think they're getting an all-natural brand like i did now if you're the person that reads the back of every bottle in your shower i would probably stop using this brand if not these ingredients they're fine i guess i should mention that i'm totally biased now that after i read the ftc complaint i can't stand when companies do like this it makes me angry i feel duped you think i'm walking around whole foods to get ripped off on artificial products no i like to get ripped off on natural products yes i use artificial products all the time but i don't buy them from whole fans yeah maybe i'm just a little upset that i got duped that's on me on a good note there was a news investigation that found that chikai had accurate levels of cbd moving on here's the dose breakdown per gram they claim 4.41 milligrams per gram we found about five milligrams of cbd per gram a gram is basically a milliliter it's a small squirt the size of a quarter that can be applied over an entire body part it's a low dose for topicals five milligrams some are three milligrams at five milligrams common but higher is like 10 or 15 or 20 milligrams of cbd per gram not enough is known about topical cbd doses i don't personally feel much from five milligrams so i did a little test on this one i used two grams on one foot and then one gram on the other foot i just used it for uh soreness from biking my arches always hurt after i still felt soreness from the five milligram dose and on the other foot with about 10 milligrams i felt some relief i also felt relief from other products before with 10 milligrams or over but i do like higher doses like 15 milligrams this is just me could totally be a placebo everyone has different responses to cbd because of your natural endocannabinoid system your individual tolerance to cbd i don't usually even give my personal experience because it's misleading for most people because most people have a different experience always consult with a doctor for real medical advice blah blah blah don't kick me off youtube anyway if cbd doesn't work sometimes you just need more this uh also doesn't have the other pain relief ingredients that a lot of them have like menthol they make one with menthol two if that's what you're looking for this is unscented cbd lotion so five milligrams is a low dose of just cbd for topical cbd creams the cream itself is nice it's odorless it has a smell just like a clean cream smell i can't really describe it it's not good or bad it's just a nice cream that goes on clear and there's uh zero hem smell because it's just cbd the uh the bottle is nice it looks like something you would see in whole foods but also something you would see in walmart because it's a nice mass marketed brand at a still lowish price the uh the lotion's okay i personally won't buy from a brand that marketed itself as natural and then got slapped by the ftc the the product itself is okay i'm just a little disappointed here i was uh all excited for this one because people can just go pick it up at a bunch of retail locations and i thought it was kind of high end because it was at whole foods but maybe maybe whole foods is the problem here remember when whole foods sold asparagus water just a water bottle with two sticks of asparagus in it for like six bucks i feel the same way now as i did about a company selling asparagus water just just bitter i've gotta go see you next time you", "RqDq_VnZ8Ok": "No Oh hi I'm John Gallagher from learning herbs calm in Mountain Rose herbs and welcome to herbal basics today we're going to make an herbal salve Salve czar very useful preparations it can be used similar to the way many people use something like neosporin for example how a salve is used depends on what herbs are in it and what you're making it for such as wound healing moisturizing aches and pains bruises and insect repellent and so on making a salve is a very convenient way to preserve the medicinal qualities of the plant material in a form that can be easily applied for various conditions it's easy to use and it's not messy like carrying around an herbal oil in your bag for example today we're going to make our sev out of comfrey oil to learn how to make your comfort oil you can refer to an earlier herbal basics lesson or you can simply purchase 8 ounces of comfrey infused oil which is what we need for our lesson today that's 8 ounces why comfrey comfrey contains a LAN toing which encourages rapid cell regeneration for this reason your comfrey sad that we're going to make here it's going to help wounds heal quickly the oil is also very moisturizing and will even help heal bruises so let's make our staff as with all herbal remedies you can make them in a variety of ways with a variety of materials but most often these days a salve is made with an herbal infused vegetable based oil like this comfrey leaf in olive oil infused in olive oil like we made in a previous lesson combined with beeswax beeswax allows the oils that are liquid at room temperature to harden I happen to have these neat little one-ounce pieces that I have for the herbal medicine making kit on learning herbs calm but you can simply break off an ounce off a larger brick of wax or if you have wax shavings it doesn't matter as long as by weight you have it on slacks and that's the magic formula the magic formula is 1 ounce of wax by weight to 1 cup of oil by volume ok that's 8 ounces as a cup okay so 1 to 1 easy to so when you make yourself you know how much you're going to end up with so in this case we have a cup of oil along with a bit more liquid when the salve amount I'm going to India when the wax melts so we have to prepare our containers take that into account so I have some containers here also from the herbal kit I've got 4 1 ounce tins I've got a couple of 2 ounce containers these might be a little more than 2 ounces actually might be 4 ounces but but in any case whatever it is always make sure I have ample containers when I start even if I'm not sure I kind of overdo it just because there's you know you don't want to end up with hot salve material and not enough containers to fill it with so I always have make sure I have enough containers so I need to prep those before I start and we're also going to use some lavender essential oil ok it smells wonderful and it also has wonderful healing properties in itself so we'll see how that's used so let's get making our SAFF now first I get out my double boiler and I put a little water in the bottom of the double boiler and get it simmering and then I put the top right on there like that now you don't have to use a double boiler you can also use any old medium sized saucepan and but what if you do use a soft span just make sure that your heats on low because you don't want to risk scorching the wax or the oil so a saucepan is fine I just happen to have one of these I got this at a thrift store locally for like 5 bucks so if you find one of these awesome but you don't need this piece of equipment you can use a regular saucepan so don't let this from stop you from making your salve okay alright so and then we simply add our gotta beeswax to the pot there and it is going to melt and now this is salve cam a view from above you see the wax melting starting to melt and melting a little more so my 1 ounce by weight of wax has melted and I take my 1 cup by volume of herbal infused oil and I pour it on in weird what just happened is that I just poured some room temperature oil in hot wax and the oil solidified a little bit or the wax solidified rather so what's going to happen now is I'm just going to leave it on the stove longer until it once again completely melts and you can simply stir it a bit as it's going along to help it out alright our SAP mixture has completely liquefied behind this here see that and I am just going to pour it back into our Pyrex container our measuring cup because it has a nice spout on it so now you see our finished salve liquid here okay this is what we're going to pour into our containers right now we have to do it quickly because it's kind of hardened as you see it's starting to already on the edge here what you want to do for essential oil is put in about two drops per quarter ounce in this case that comes out to about a teaspoon actually about sixty four drops so I have that measured in there and I just want to mix that around that's my lavender essential oil here you can also add just a few drops an alternative is to as you're pouring these in your containers I have to start doing that so it doesn't harden on me an alternative is that you can simply put in a few drops or more depending on how much scent you like in your sap like this as you're doing it as you're pouring it you could do like one two two four but I already put it in so I'm just going to keep pouring so if you noticed I have my jars open ready to go so we have to be quick about it and if you ever do this and you notice a lot of your salve hardens I like to pour it out in small batches if you notice that that you can just swap it back in the in the your pan and remelt it so you're not you're not in dire straits if you don't okay and there's a wee bit more in here and I could easily pour that another small tin I don't want to get a huge jar full I'm only going to have a little bit in it but I'll Rimmel Tam innit and put it in another little container but like I said I always have extra encase because you know I guess I've done it enough for him like oh no where's another container I need another container so what we're going to do now while we watch this I guess these jars right here the jars are a little larger than I thought they were but that's why it's good to know your sizes huh so anyway we're going to hang out for a second as our poured salve hardens and now you see it continuing to harden here like on the bottom do the different color so that's hardening and there we have it see this once the large jar is still solidifying but the ones in the tins because they're smaller has finished so I can just put the lids on them and these containers by the way are available in the supply section of Mountain Rose herbs as well so and then you can also then put a pretty label on it like such as these this is from our herbal kit on learning herbs I'm not going to put them on it because it's not a right salve mixture but just gives you an idea that that you what you can do to decorate them really easy to make labels you can get any Avery labels these are the one I think the 1.67 in diameter labels and you can get a template they often have templates you can download let's say in word and you can drag and drop artwork and write pretty you know put pretty pictures in it and write what the SAB is and print them right out and stick them right on your nice tins if you've liked that sort of thing or you can just get a little blank label and write on it handwriting too and then we'll put the cap on this one and it'll harden up real soon so there you have it your finished herbal SAVs store your finish Savin your herbal cabinet for later use for longer storage you can also place it in your refrigerator staff making is endless and there are many reasons to make it and many herbs to try for oil making if you want to try making your comfort with fresh concrete you can check out our video on herb mentor com thanks so much and have fun making yourself

to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see

meet them at the villa [Music]", "m3UGmhUWhmI": "medical cannabi oil cannabis oil the cbd2 is to one it says or p used to one i don't know i can't believe i'm not wearing my specs so i got that p this is how the bottle looks it's uh it's with drops you know now i took this like maybe one hour back and uh one and a half or two hours back and here's what i'm noticing number one the sense of taste in your mouth it changes i took three drops sense of taste in your mouth changes number one number two i noticed that um [Music] my brain is working better when i had coffee it tasted different so sense of taste changes my brain is working much better i'm able to be a little more friendly and alert both do i feel high no i just feel a bit confident i feel a bit um you know i feel like working i feel uh a bit happy not happy but i feel a bit content like there's no low in the mood the mood is a little up so that's good um other things so this is the maybe the fourth or seventh time i'm taking cbd and just wanted to tell you what happens when you take it so you take it you don't drink anything for 15 20 minutes and you can take it in the morning and i usually take three to five drops max and um the good thing is that you have a better day than you would without it you're in a better mood than you would be without it you are more efficient than you would be without it food tastes better could be a good thing if you're having bad food it is supposed to let go of pain give you less pain this is tired and tested it is good for that let's go you don't feel that much pain with cbd um now let's talk about the negatives i think i think it could make you feel um hungry more hungry than you would without it so it's sort of like ashwagandha on that front you will definitely feel more hungry than you would feel without it and you will end up eating more than you would without it because food will taste better um you would probably consume 400 i consume on average 400 to 800 calories more than i would without cbd but i'm trying to see if i can control myself if there is something i can do to dodge that thing but that is the only negative i can think about right now other than that it's mostly positive how much does this cost i think i paid about 10 000 bucks for this bottle and i don't know it's 10 ml or 20 ml let me check i simply googled it and the first thing it showed me was a paid advertisement um this is 66 thc what and 33 cvd it says 9 700 bucks for this another about 600 2 000 bucks for getting a prescription you're looking at about 10 500 odd to get cbd um if you're thinking it's expensive i don't think it's expensive because i've used it six times or eight times and somebody else has used it 10 12 times so and it's still right on the top it's easy to use it's uh it's legal now if you get a prescription everything is legal and they give you a prescription it's pretty straightforward so you can simply google this i think it's called cbd online or something like that they're not paying me anything for it nobody pays me anything dude so yeah that was a quick review of cbd um i will do more of this so i can do better review i don't know it has thc by the way dsc is supposed to make you feel high i feel a little better but i don't know if i'm high man i smoke joints that's completely different now other things i've tried is ashwagandha which is quite similar to this it does make you very hungry more hungry than cbd would make you maybe because it's a bigger dose and second thing i've tried is modafinil i've done two reviews of that um cbd does not help you read it does not make you faster it just makes you more aware and in the moment um i didn't do this review for the longest time because i thought i'll do it so well and all that but i feel a job done is better than a job not done like imperfect is better than just being perfect also i was waiting for a day but i looked good and then a month passed away and i still don't look good but i'm still uploading it because somebody has to", "AVE5mJqc2mw": "how you guys chelsey cherry here with the triple-threat lifestyle and I am here to dive right into this beam product review now those of you that don't know me I am a huge huge stickler on recovery now being a personal trainer it's super important for the grind to happen but it's also just as important to refuel and recover so I have teamed up with the company beam and they sent me this awesome goodie bag so I'm gonna dive right in I have my notes right here just so I can make sure that I cover everything that I am joy or did not enjoy about this product alright so we're gonna go ahead and start out with this CBD oil so it comes a little box like this has 500 milligrams in this container and per serving is sixteen point six seven reading right off the label here it comes in a little container like this and then it has a little dropper so you can squeeze it and nice and conveniently you can put it in your smoothies your teeth whatever healthy beverages protein shake so that you don't even taste it so I like that and they say that you can drop it under your tongue for convenience um but it's nice to put in your beverages as well this is good for anxiety focus better sleep so all of those things I personally like to put them in my smoothies and drink it in my teeth as I'm working to help me focus in and kind of relax a little bit so that's something that I enjoyed about that next we're gonna go to the CBeebies saddle which looks like this coming a little container like so and you can see I dug in it a little bit but nice little container where all you have to do break your nail in it and rub a little pea-sized amount anywhere you're feeling sore I personally enjoy using this after I take a nice warm Epsom salt bath and then I like to use them up put this on and then follow it up with some foam rolling and it is so therapeutic not dimension this smell is amazing it smells almost like a lemongrass fragrance so this is good it helps with pain relief and an especially recovery after workout so major there next thing we are going to go ahead and jump into the power bars the protein bar is too got all the flavors here vanilla coconut and the cow here I personally enjoy the vanilla coconut the best and a couple of things that I really enjoyed about this product is the protein cow has best good amount of protein in here if I'm not mistaking how I actually read it right off the label to be accurate it has 14 grams of protein in a bar and then the calorie count right here it's 260 but don't be afraid because the fat content is only 12 grams so of those 260 calories only 12 grams of fat are in those and high protein content so that is awesome so you know pairing the all three products together is whenever you'll have the best effect so you can eat these for breakfast on the gnats or just to refuel so these you can put in your smoothies protein shakes tea or under your tongue and then the South you can use with your recovery as you foam roll or if you gents have any aches of pain so the best recommendation is to pair all three of these products together for the best results however if you want to just give one of them a try go for it I personally really enjoyed this product I will say the only setback is the protein bars don't really have like your signature bar taste it's very unique very earthy I wouldn't say it's you know gross but it's not like the most tasty bar that I've had but it's filled with such great nutrients to feel your body so if you're one to you know want it as much nutrient-dense food that's for you so this is my product review on the beam products line I hope you enjoyed it please comment share leave some reviews I would love your feedback and I hope that you enjoy following my other content so go ahead and subscribe if you haven't already and I look forward to having my next video", "FgFhRBCuRrY": "3 3 3 IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU:

Christmas week series this one is yet another one that can be really pricey online and we're gonna show you how to do it for that cheap cheap Oh actually remember we were doing that series we were getting our makeup done and then the makeup artist totally recommend this like a little bomb serum um I bought it but it was like fifty dollars why but I like really liked it when she used it on me so I was like this is solely worth it what was it for uh you can use it on your lips it's like a bomb just like the thing we're making today especially the moisturizing one and gave us what the ingredients are they're like the exactly the same as wax they are oil so if you guys haven't figured out already we are gonna show you how to make a DIY solve ourselves however you want to say it or bombs yeah so many fun words for this thing so basically these can be used to moisturize but also to soothe different problems that you might have or somebody that you want to give it to you my house so we're making a couple different kinds today one is more first skin and lavender is really good for skin and healing skin so you can use that essential oil in your salad or balm also pepper and cayenne we're using in a muscle ache balm yep and this one's right music heats up so the warmth is really nice on muscles and another ingredient you could try mixing in is peppermint because performance really cooling it helps to like soothe if you have headaches raining that's hot so you want to cool it down it's fun to play around with ingredients like that yes but let's get started with the ones that we are tackling today so our first salt is a moisturizing style and this is perfect for combating their really cold dry winters that we experienced here in Canada yes which I'm sure a lot of people out there to also experience in different parts of the world so to make this you're going to want to pick up these ingredients coconut oil shea butter some grated beeswax and avocado oil or you could just use regular olive oil and if you're planning to make this for a gift make sure you pick up a measuring cup or a container that you're only gonna use for making these types of things because the waxes and the oils can leave a permanent residue on the containers that you might not want to cook with and of course you're using a glass measuring cup as well as other glass tools because we're gonna be heating up don't use plastic add three tablespoons of grated beeswax to the measuring cup create a double boiler by adding some water into a larger pot and then placing a measuring cup or bowl inside and heating the water we used a glass measuring cup that we had just because we use this specifically for DIYs and we can place it in there and not worry about anything happening to it or melting it because it's class let the beeswax fully melts and then add half a cup of avocado oil 2 tablespoons of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil once everything is fully melted together you honestly shouldn't need to stir that much it kind of just blends nicely but you can stir it if you want take that out from your double boiler and then add in your essential oils you can use whatever essential oil that you want but if you want to use lavender that is really good for the skin and then you're gonna want to pour yourself into a giftable container we have these really cute tins we'll link you guys some options below but you can also use mason jars as a pretty standard one our second self is a heating saw and this is great for achy muscles to make this heating salv you'll need to go pick up the following coconut oil grated beeswax cayenne pepper ground ginger ground black pepper rosemary essential oil avocado oil or olive oil again start with a measuring cup in a larger pot of water add in two tablespoons of grated beeswax 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of avocado oil or olive oil 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons of ground ginger 2 teaspoons of pepper stir them all together and let them melt so next add something to strain the mixture to the top of a separate container and pour the mixture on top so we tried using a standard coffee filter at first but that didn't strain it very well it didn't seem to drip through fast enough we then had to switch to a fine fabric that we just owned for previous DIYs and that worked perfectly yeah now I've also heard that pantyhose works amazing for this make sure that they're new yeah but you could try that as well from the dollar store and here's what all the chunky ingredients looks like that we strained out you can add the container back into the hot water if you find a mixture has cooled too quickly add in 20 drops of rosemary essential oil or really whatever essential oil you want but rosemary is great for this one and pour it into your little giftable containers so to make these super cute and giftable we use an old-school label maker to write on the side of them what they're gonna do for you aches relief moisturize they won't cause a total relieve and then we wrap them with some holidays wine [Music] so to actually use these selves you just need to rub your hands in them to warm them up a little bit and you should turn into a super moisturizing consistency and then you can put it on any problem area that's like dry skin or if you have sore muscles sometimes I take out like the solid form and put it on the back of my hand and then I warm it up there and then again apply it wherever you need to yeah super easy we hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make these the best thing is that a lot of the base ingredients are similar so once you buy them in bulk you can make a ton of different versions of this make sure you guys tune in to our other videos throughout all of gift week we have so many fun ideas that are affordable and easy to do I can't you love them yes then if you like this video make sure that you give it a like if you love it make sure you sub it we'll see you next time bye guys [Music]", "vXi_5zGIVbw": "MONTHS, HOWEVER IT HAS ALSO BEEN STIRRING UP CONTROVERSY.  IT'S CALLED C-B-D... AND SOME CLAIM IT HAS  MEDICAL PROPERTIES...  9 ON YOUR SIDE'S KARA GANN IS DIGGING DEEPER TONIGHT, INTO THE PRODUCTS MADE  WITH C-B-D.  PRODUCTS WITH CBD  INSIDE HAVE BEEN POPPING UP EVERYWHERE, RAISING  THE QUESTION \"WHAT IS  CBD?\" SO WE TOOK THOSE QUESTIONS TO EXPERTS TO FIND OUT .  YOU CAN FIND CBD IN  JUST ABOUT ANY FORM..  OILS, SOAPS, LOTIONS,  CREAMS, BATH BOMBS,  EVEN FOOD. CBD OR SCIENTIFICALLY  CALLED \"CANNABIDIAL\" IS  ONE OF MANY  CANNABINOIDS IN THE  HEMP PLANT.  THESE PRODUCTS RECENTLY MADE THEIR  WAY ONTO STORE SHELVES AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP  SIGNED THE \"2018 FARM  BILL\" INTO EFFECT LAST DECEMBER.  THE BILL ULTIMATELY  ALLOWS HEMP TO BE  GROWN AS AN  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. BUT WHAT IS CBD AND IS IT SAFE? WE ASKED DR KEN SODERSTROM, AN ASSOICATE PROFESSOR  WITH THE DEPARTMENT  OF PHARMACOLOGY AND  TOXICOLOGY AT ECU'S  BRODY SCHOOL OF  MEDICINE.  \"it is a drug and like any drug it is potentially toxic and so it is something to be careful about.\"  \"the most typical way of administering CBD is by  troche in oil under the  tongue.\" BUT CAN CBD GET YOU \"HIGH\" LIKE  SMOKING MARIJUANA? \"cannibidiol will not get you  high but other things that come along with it as the oils extracted may get you high and the principal among  those is delta 9 thc.\" THC IS  THE PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOID IN THE CANNIBIS PLANT...  WHICH IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL AND  MOST STATE LAWS. SO DO THESE CBD  PRODUCTS HAVE THC  INSIDE? \"...it will have some thc yes.\" CONSUMER  GRADE CBD PRODUCTS DO CONTAIN .3 PERCENT  OF THC.. HOWEVER SODERSTROM SAYS THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO QUOTE ON QUOTE \"GET YOU HIGH\" \"it may have just a trace but it will always have some  measurable amount of cannabinoids that are  psychoactive.\" THE NEXT  QUESTION MANY ARENT  SURE ABOUT IS WILL CBD PRODUCTS WITH THC  INSIDE SHOW UP ON A  DRUG TEST? WE ASKED  MICHELLE EDMUNDSON,  OWNER OF E AND S HEMP  COMPANY IN WINTERVILLE. \"we ask people to come see their doctors they go they talk to their doctors and then 90 percent of them go and  come back and the doctor says its fine and the second thing is do you have to take a drug test..\" \"so yeah it will  march right across and get into your blood stream.\" EDMUNDSON SAID INITIALLY SHE HAD HER  DOUBTS ABOUT CBD PRODUCTS.  \"I thought it was a snake  oil.\" YET AFTER SEEING POSITIVE RESULTS IN  HER HEALTH.. SHE DECIDED TO OPEN  THE SHOP.  \"I was on antidepressant medicine, no longer on any of that, don't have to take  anything to sleep any more my anxiety levels are down.\" AND MANY OF HER  CLIENTS SAY THEY TOO HAVE HAD POSITIVE  EXPERIENCES WITH IT. \"I have clients that have  fiber myalgia, arthritis,  hashimotos, lupis, rheumatoid arthrisits, osteoarthris, and the cbd oil  brings down that inflammation and helps their pain.\" ONE FATHER TELLS  ME HIM AND HIS WIFE  CREATED THEIR OWN  BRAND OF CBD OIL FOR THEIR SON WHO  SUFFERED FROM  SEIZURES.  \"knowing that we were able to do it naturally for him and do it the right way, what we feel is the right way I  honestly still emotional about it because hes thriving.\"  NOW, WALLACE SAYS HIS  SON NOAH IS SEIZURE  FREE.. THEY CREDIT THAT TO  CBD \"you know hes three  and a half and hes brilliant he has no issues and its just  an amazing experience to create something and hopefully help other people  as well.\" ANOTHER  QUESTION OF CONCERN  IS.. IS IT LEGAL? \"now its  presumably legal at the  federal level but you have regulatory agencies like the FDA contacting distributors  saying you are going too far marketing this as an effective drug.\" OILS, DROPLETS UNDER THE TONGUE, AND TOPICALS ARE ALL LEGAL  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF  AGRICULUTURE ONLY IF THEY ARE SOLD WITHOUT  HEALTH CLAIMS. IN 2018 THE FDA  APPROVED A DRUG WITH CBD AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT CREATED TO  HELP CHILDREN WITH EPILEPSY.  NOW THE AG DEPARTMENT SAYS SINCE  THIS FORM OF CBD,  CALLED \"CBD ISOLATE\" , CBD IN ITS PURESTEST FORM.. IS IN THE NEW  MEDICATION.. ANY FOOD PRODUCTS  ON THE MARKET WITH THIS CBD FORM IS ILLEGAL TO SELL. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO SENT LETTERS TO RETAIL SHOPPES, LIKE EDMUNSONS INFORMING  THEM ABOUT THE NEW REGULATIONS..  SHE SAYS SHE HAS PULLED ITEMS ITEMS WITH CBD ISOLATE OUT OF HER STORE.  tag THE FDA WILL HOST A  PUBLIC FORUM ON MAY  31ST AT THEIR WHITE OAK  CAMPUS IN WASHINGTON DC TO DISCUSS SOME OF  THESE NEW  REGULATIONS.

recreational marijuana and now we're getting the CBD oil and CBD stuff everywhere people are taking C V D supplements people are putting it on their skin people are giving it to their pets what is the deal with this stuff we're gonna answer those questions and lots lots more hang tight we're getting into it right now have you been paying attention to skin care releases over the past year you may have noticed a huge influx of products containing CBD as an ingredient and it is estimated that it will be a 16 billion dollar industry by the year 2025 but should it be is this something that you should invest your money in first we need to decide what this stuff is and what it isn't so all hemp is cannabis but not all cannabis is hemp so hemp is something that is within the cannabis category what you're gonna see on labels is cannabis L sativa and that is the hemp plant it is a low THC version of the cannabis plant within this plant there are over 80 different cannabinoids these things that you can extract from the plant in order to get different effects so one of them is CBD one of them is THC THC is the one that gives you the psychoactive effects so when you've got hemp seed oil it has a very very low percentage of THC it actually needs to be below 0.3% in order to even be legal now what is CBD it's cannabidiol is how it's pronounced and cannabidiol will not get you high in that is not its purpose that is not what it does that's THC it's completely separate and because of that it there's no restrictions on flights you can't get arrested for having it in your car like it doesn't matter where you live in the United States it is a federal law that it is legal as long as there is that 0.3% were less of that THC in the product and products being sold on the shelves are legally they have to have less than that point three percent if they have point four percent they're considered any legal substance now because this is brand new companies are really taking advantage of the lacs rules when it comes to CBD some people are taking hemp seed oil and they're marketing it as CBD but if it just says hemp seed oil it's not CBD there's no CBD in just straight hemp seed oil and because of that you're not going to get the the alleged benefits of the CBD if you just get hemp seed oil so the biggest thing is that the CBD oils have anti-inflammatory properties so anytime you have inflammation whether it's dry skin eczema psoriasis that is supposed to be helped by CBD oil another big one is as an acne treatment because of the inflammation that occurs naturally with acne there's actually a second thing that they're studying as far as the acne treatment which is it's supposed to help control your sebum production that extra oil production so that would help people with acne as well if it were true again there just isn't a ton of research on it right now they're also saying it in certain concentrations it may have pain-killing properties similar to like a bengay kind of product and it also may have antioxidant properties that would help with fine lines and wrinkles and skin dullness it also seems to be safe for sensitive skin which is another big thing so if CBD can do all of these things it'll be magical but again the research just isn't there this is where a lot of companies have gotten into a lot of trouble because they're putting these claims on these CBD products that it can do all of these amazing things that are medical claims but these medical claims haven't been proven they had there's no scientific research behind it and as a cosmetic you can't make medical claims so people weren't claiming this is crazy I know but I mean you think about people that were reading this and thinking that this was a hundred percent true that it could treat conditions like Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease depression anxiety PTSD cancer treatment a treatment for schizophrenia for eating disorders and addiction these were real claims that companies were making about their CBD oil products and the FDA and the FTC had to step in and be like no no this is not ok and they got letters kind of cease and desist kind of letters to stop making those claims and they had to pull their products from the shelves so yes this ingredient is FDA approved but just because it's FDA approved doesn't mean it actually does anything the research just isn't there yet in 2018 the farm bill passed and what that did was it loosened regulations on hemp-based products that's why we're seeing this big boom in the market right now my husband and I went down to the Cosmoprof event down in Las Vegas and we went to well I went to a CBD base it's called a cosmetologist and that one was the most full packed people with so many questions I mean it was like wall-to-wall people there are so many brands that are looking at adding CBD to their products and my purpose for making this video is just to let you know that yes it could do lots of really great things for your skin but you also could be throwing your money down the toilet by buying them so you have to realize when you purchase something like this that it may or may not work and if you have tried CBD based products I would love to know your thoughts about your personal experiences with them down in the comments below in the collective brain of makeup awesomeness where we help each other not to buy crap and to buy things that are totally worth it please leave those thoughts because I would love to learn from you and your experiences I do have a CBD product that I'm trying from makeup revolution if there's skincare revolution line right now I haven't seen anything magical with it but I also don't have psoriasis eczema acne those things that will probably be really showing visible results if they were doing those things I'd be able to see them more than I do with my fine lines and wrinkles so let's all work together to learn more about this topic I hope that you found it helpful again anything you want to add leave it down in the comments thank you so much for watching and subscribe before you go mad love to you and I will see you in a video very very soon", "NXNPDILjQ94": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello everybody and welcome back to your query cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be making cinnamon flavored CBD oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here and you've already subscribed don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and I really do appreciate you guys supporting our channel so today we're gonna be making a cinnamon flavored CBD oil now the first ingredient of course is going to be our hemp flour that we grew this summer and today we're going to be using our cherry wine have flour so this came in at 17.4% CBD so we'll be doing 13 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour per cup so a total of 26 grams of d carb hemp flour but and today's recipe I will be adding cherry wine shake or trim now this is just trim buzz the sugar leaves or buds that fell off during the trim bag process and these are great to add CBD a now CBD a is the raw plant material so when it's d carved it removes the a and then you just have regular old CBD that we're all familiar with CBD a has its own good properties so we are going to be adding about 4 grams of raw material on top of the D kar material and as you just heard the oven is preheated so is that 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to put it in for 30 minutes so while we're waiting for the D carve our I'm gonna gather all the materials in the magic butter machine get that all set up so we can start making our flavored CBD oil 10 grams of cherry wine trim or shake whatever you want to call it this is raw plant material that is not decarboxylated and I'll get our decarboxylated hemp flour in a minute so I did 5 grams per cup of MCT oil so the first time add that material right into the magic butter machine next I'm going to measure out two cups of MCT oil okay so that's 2 cups now I'm going to add our cinnamon now this is all-natural ground cinnamon and you really don't want to overpower it now is the cinnamon going to eliminate the plant flavor no it's definitely going to knock it down but it's not going to taste like a big red or anything like that ok and I do just about a half a spoonful and right into the machine it goes now machine has a blender and a grinder so don't have to mix it around or anything like that now I'm going to go ahead and grab our D carved hemp flour now that's 26 grams of our cherry one head flower at 17.4% cvd so and it goes I can never get all the buds into the magic butter machine without losing a couple of them ok get this out of here and that's the recipe folks and of course I will leave the recipe down in the description below we're going to plug in our magic bard machine get it ready to go all right and we are going to do 160 degrees for 4 hours so I'll see you in four hours and I'll show you the finished product okay so it's been four hours and it's time to get the product out of the magic butter machine so stereotypical magic butter machine style you know you've got to get all the plant material off the base of the blender you know nothing crazy but you don't want to lose that material or at least try the best you can to get it off you're gonna do the same thing on the container you can see in there all that plant material so it's gonna get that all out of here all right looks good now again if you're using another kitchen gadget you know it really depends how messy you want things well that's why I like the magic butter machine so we're going to get our magic butter micron filter and put that into our four cup Pyrex and dump it in you know see if we can get all that out of here again the reason why you want all this plant material is the more you can get in this micron bag the squeeze the more will you're gonna get out of it because all this plant material has got oil in it okay it looks pretty good for now we're gonna get the love gloves silicone gloves just shake it down we're going to give it to squeeze you can see all that material coming out of there all that oil coming out of there so I'm excited to give this a go I know it's gonna be great in some like chai tea stuff like that that cinnamon really holds some good flavor again it doesn't get rid of the plant taste but it definitely covers it a little bit so that's it for today guys I really hope you enjoyed this video hope you use this recipe to your advantage and before we close out the video I want to remind everybody you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now I'll leave those links in the description below along with the recipe that I use today and thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed yet please do don't

cbd oil in india her appeal witnessed some criticism the recent controversy about the use of drugs in bollywood has stigmatized the usage of cbd cbd oil is basically an extract from the cannabis plant in today's edition of our dns we will know what is cbd oil what are its effects its use and is the consumption legal in india or not as we mentioned above cbd oil is an extract from cannabis plant the main active substance in this are cannabidiol or cbd and delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or thc cbd oil is made by extracting cbd from the cannabis plant then diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut or hemp seed oil the high that is caused by the consumption of cannabis is due to the thc cbd does not cause a high or any form of intoxication cbd is most commonly available in form of oils and tinctures what is the usage of cbd oil cbd is extracted from marijuana plants it is extracted as either an oil or powder these can be mixed into crams or gels they can be put in capsules and taken orally or rubbed on skin all topical cannabis infused products should be applied directly to the site of inflammation or pain to work in a specific area what are the effects of cannabidiol cannabidiol has effects on the brain preventing the breakdown of chemical that aggravates pain and affects mood and mental function it can reduce pain and anxiety cbd oil has shown promising results in reducing anxiety and depression in both human and animal cbd has also been used to treat insomnia and insight in children with post-traumatic stress disorder it also reduces psychotic symptoms associated with conditions such as scisophernia as well as epilepsy is cbd oil helpful in treating cancer there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that cbd oil can safely and effectively treat cancer or not however cbd can help elevate symptoms related to cancer and side effects of chemotherapy such as pain nausea vomiting etc however a study from the european journal of pain showed that cbd applied on the skin could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis cbd inhibits inflammatory and neuropathic pain associated with cancer studies have also revealed that people who took marijuana extracts in clinical trials tended to need less pain medicine the us-based national cancer institute mentions that cbd may help elevate side effects of cancer treatment as well is cbd oil legal in india you", "1ywDAataO2A": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about how to make cbd oil with hemp seed oil and maybe some of the common misconceptions that go along with hemp seed oil but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support so folks if you are new here to the channel we are a hemp farm and today we will be using our own hemp flour this particular strain that we will be using is biox we also have cherry one which we also like to make oil with biox berry and other strains available on our website so if you guys are looking into making cbd oil and you need some hemp flour go ahead and check out the links in the description below we can ship to pretty much all 50 states so folks let's talk about the common misconception with hemp seed oil and how to use it to make cbd oil so some folks see hemp oil or hemp seed oil and they think that it has cbd in it and it really has zero cannabinoids in it there really is nothing in it other than the value of the oil from the hemp seed itself so there's really no cannabinoids in it today we have some hemp seed oil that was cold pressed it's organic it's good stuff and we're going to be using 16 ounces of that oil now you can use eight ounces we're going to make a larger batch today we're also going to be using 28 grams of cbd hemp flour you can use more so this is one ounce it's a very standard recipe 16 ounces of oil to one ounce of flour you can use two ounces of flour to 16 ounces of oil as well today we're not gonna be making a super strong batch but if you are looking for a more potent oil i suggest doing two ounces to two cups and i'll leave that recipe in the description of the video as well but we will be using our biox strain from our farm that we grew here again guys if you are interested go ahead and check out the links in the description below now the first thing you're going to do is you're going to decarb your flower obviously if you purchase it from us it's already going to be in a one ounce measured bag and you go ahead and put it in your d card box now today we're going to be using our magic butter d card box you can use a pyrex dish with a cover but it needs to be covered and you're going to put it in the oven at 250 for 30 minutes that really activates all the cannabinoids in the hemp flour to really get that cbd to transfer into the oil also what you will be needing is obviously a magic butter machine but you will need once the oil is done you're going to need a filter and a silicone glove this is to squeeze out the remaining oil from the flowers into your jar or whatever you're going to put it in for use and again folks you will need a hemp seed oil 16 ounces you can use eight ounces as well so you can use eight ounces of oil with one ounce of flour if you want the potency but not as much oil i don't really recommend that for the magic butter machine i really recommend 16 ounces of oil the machine doesn't really do well with only eight ounces of oil that's just my take on it you can use the magic butter machine with eight ounces of oil i believe they say you can but that's just not how we make it here on the farm so folks let's get into making cbd oil with our hemp seed oil with our magic butter machine okay folks so the cbd hemp flour is out of the oven looking good and here's our biox flour so what we're going to do is this is obviously one ounce that we already pre-measured and we're going to go ahead and not spill it so we're going to put the first handful in and then we're going to gently put it into the magic butter machine i always end up spilling it hopefully today we're all good so there's that then we've already put some in here this is eight ounces we already did one but for just for viewing purposes we already put one in the machine so you're gonna go ahead open this guy up and in it goes pretty easy again there's 16 ounces of hemp seed oil in here okay so the next thing you're going to do you're going to take the machine you are going to put it on so i've already plugged it in and what we're going to be doing is a tincture i know on the machine it says one hour for oil i just don't like the one hour recipe i like to give it enough time to really absorb into the oil so what we're going to do is we're going to select our temperature which will be 160 degrees we're going to select the four hour button and that is it so we will see you guys in four hours and let the machine do the work okay folks it's been uh four hours and the oil just went off so now all we're going to do is we're going to collect the oil it's really not much different than using mct or olive oil pretty pretty much the same you really can't tell the difference until you taste it um it's just not a much of a difference as far as like you know texture or anything like that what it looks like so this is what we're going to do we're just going to scrape off all the edges so all this is is just a flower that's kind of gotten on the edges from the blender of the magic butter machine pretty common nothing to be worried about all right so then what you're going to do is your initial pour you're going to go ahead and pour it right in now i'm using a uh pyrex uh dish i really like to use this then you can just transfer it uh over to wherever you're gonna store it most people supposed to store it in a mason jar or like a squeeze bottle or something like that so first you're just gonna take your glove get that initial squeeze pretty easy all right so now what we're going to do is get all the plant material that you can see down here let me move this so i can show you guys what it looks like down in there pretty normal um it's just a bunch of plant material what that does is it kind of holds on to a lot of oil and so that's why the glove comes in real handy you could just discard this and you know not get that extra little bit of oil it's it's not unheard of um but a lot of people like to go and get that little extra oil now everything's clean in there we put it off to the side we take the glove and go ahead and squeeze that material that was in the magic butter machine pretty easy all right and that's it so here is your cbd oil uh for you to put in a mason jar any container it doesn't matter but should be good for a while and uh you know people ask a lot about potency you know the hemp flour plays a role the cooking plays a role decarbing plays a role there's so many factors that potency really can't be calculated unless it's done in a lab so that's what i tell a lot of people so if you're watching this video and you're thinking what's the potency you really have to get it lab tested this particular batch will not be lab tested um so we won't know uh what the milligrams are for this particular batch but it nonetheless it's cbd and you know that there is cbd in it because you put cbd hemp flowers in there but that is all i have for you guys today if you guys are interested in the hemp flower we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below guys have questions feel free to leave a comment always reach out via instagram facebook or email um but that is all for today i hope you all stay happy healthy and i will see you in another video", "s4LCzj5l69M": "[Music] have you ever wondered what exactly is meant by the phrase full spectrum cbd oil is there really any difference between a full spectrum product and say another type of cbd product let's take a look let me go ahead and remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf youtube channel we deliver the industry's most accurate and up-to-date information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the topic of what actually full spectrum cbd oil is it's really pretty simple cbd is just one of more than a hundred different compounds naturally found in the cannabis sativa plant a full spectrum cbd oil well contains pretty much all of these compounds a product like cbd isolate oil on the other hand contains just the cbd compound by itself after it's been filtered and fractionated off during the manufacturing process depending on what exactly you're trying to achieve full spectrum cbd oil can actually work better than a cbd isolate in fact research shows that when cannabinoids work together rather than isolated by themselves they're potentially more effective in terms of a therapeutic benefit this phenomenon is known as the entourage effect but we'll talk more about that later as far as what a full spectrum cbd oil actually contains they can include a variety of natural ingredients found in hemp and other types of cannabis these ingredients include things like phytocannabinoids essential vitamins and minerals beneficial fatty acids like omega-3s and omega-6s plant-based protein and fiber chlorophyll terpenes and flavonoids also it's important to understand that full spectrum cbd oil can come from both hemp and marijuana most of the cbd products you see for sale online and in places like gas stations and grocery stores are made from hemp that contains 0.3 thc or less full spectrum cbd oils can also be made from marijuana these oils have higher levels of thc but are only available in dispensaries in states that offer legal medical or recreational cannabis one of the most important studies relating to full spectrum cbd oil took place at the hebrew university of jerusalem in 2015. the study compared the performance of a full spectrum cannabis extract with one that contained cbd only and concluded that at least in mice the full spectrum oil was more effective for pain and inflammation in fact authors of the study claimed the whole plant cannabis extract was ideal for clinical use as compared to isolated cbd another great quote we like to use in order to describe the effectiveness of full spectrum cbd oil comes from dr ethan russo in a 2019 publication in frontiers in plant science dr russo's paper claimed that one molecule i.e cbd is unlikely to match the therapeutic potential of cannabis itself as a phytochemical factory in other words while pure cbd can be effective it appears that full spectrum cbd oil is the better option for therapeutic purposes do you have any more questions about what full spectrum cbd oil is is there anything that we left out feel free to join in the conversation by leaving a

organic hemp extract in organic coconut oil this is so weird and kind of gross i actually bought this as a topical because that's what they also advertised it as a topic called nope not putting this green smelly paste on my skin sun soil is known for usda organic cbd products at an excellent price maybe the cheapest usda organic cbd products on the market i sent this coconut oil to two labs to see if it's real i've tested their products in the past they were real okay 30 bucks they claim gets you 600 milligrams of cbd the independent labs found about 21 more cpd i should note here that the labs measured this in grams and converted it it's not going to be exact sun soil made the claims in milliliters which is a measure of volume this coconut oil obviously is a shape shifter it turns into a weird green solid paste when it gets below 74 degrees fahrenheit so the lab results here will be close but not exact here's the gram breakdown which is about a milliliter close enough and it is a solid full spectrum extract no pun intended with the solid lots of cannabinoids 0.8 milligrams of thc that will add some benefits but it's still low enough i feel like for most people not all but most people will not have those uh lazy effects that are possible with thc and good amounts of cbd a cbc and cbg this is potent and it's natural which is why it tastes kind of bad the cbda that's the acid of cbd that shows that they're doing some sort of cold press extraction because cbda will turn to cbd if it's heated but that can also preserve a lot of the terpenes the flavors of hemp that are beneficial to your health but not so much your palate sometimes this uh this tastes earthy exceptionally earthy but it's a it's a great extract earthy it's 4.1 cents per milligram average cbd products are 10 cents per milligram this is organic hemp extract super potent with an expensive extraction process and organic coconut oil i'm glad they made this for people that want a potent natural organic just hemp and coconut oil they can cook with it use it orally i can't do it i'm not cooking with this the smell the taste the texture not for me but it is an excellent product i will see you next time you wonderful person you", "j79Hwu0XSkU": "hi guys welcome to another episode of ask dr. Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil now today's question comes in from Amica of Las Vegas Nevada and here's what she writes dr. Patel my eczema is out of control I've had it since I was probably 9 or 10 years old and I'm now 29 and still dealing with it my nights consist of insane scratching it's incredibly annoying I literally wake up with new scars and scabs nearly daily because of the flares when I stress it flares the most sweat triggers it too and it takes 30 minutes to get home from the gym so my eczema gets really bad in the winter time I don't have the luxury of taking hot showers I can't wear foundation and feel so embarrassed about the patches of dry flaky and inflamed skin I feel like people think I have some sort of contagious disease I've tried everything you can think of from lotions to creams even dangerous photo therapy and essential oils that are supposed to help egg them up but the eczema just keeps getting worse my dermatologist keeps prescribing steroids but they only work temporarily and I can't deal with the side effects would you recommend either CBD oil or marijuana do either of them work thanks in advance Anika Las Vegas Nevada all right Anika I imagine that having eczema must be an incredibly frustrating experience but I'm really glad that you wrote in because believe it or not there's actually research that shows that medical cannabis does help eczema now in addition to walking you through this now in addition to walking you through the medical research I'll also walk you through the results that my own patients have experienced so a human trial done back in so a human trial so a human trial done back in about the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with a top dermatitis which is otherwise known as which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had it now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with with atopic dermatitis which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks and here are the results that they reported so 70% saw an improvement in the following symptoms dryness excoriation which is skin picking essentially like henna fication which is which is when you develop thick leathery skin from from too much scratching and too much rubbing scaling which is flaking of the skin scaling which is flaking of the skin redness itching as well as an improvement in the quality of their sleep now thirty three point six percent of patients completely discontinued their use of topical steroids and in ten percent of patients the strength of the steroid was reduced significantly twenty percent of participants were able to stop their topical immunomodulators and 38 percent stopped using their oral antihistamines so what are some of the results that my patients have experienced well patient well patients with patches of eczema generally benefit from using cannabis topicals however patients with more extensive eczema really ultimately end up using some internal form of cannabis whether it's inhalation ingestion or using it sublingual II which is under the tongue now for some patients the cannabis completely clears up their skin and then for other patients it minimises redness flakiness itching and irritation however bear in mind that these changes don't occur overnight it may take up to two to four weeks to see the changes overall though my patients have experienced a reduction in the number of flares overall my patients have seen a reduction in the number of eczema flares that they experience now on the prescription front many patients are many of my patients now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of topical steroids topical immunomodulators and/or oral antihistamines so now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of the or reduce the use of their topical steroids topical immunomodulators in or oral antihistamines now before you go off and start you know stockpiling on cannabis topicals here's what i want to tell you you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting you don't you don't you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting to one of the other ingredients in a cannabis topical so test the product on a small area before you apply it all over and I'd also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema and I also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema such as parabens fragrances dyes lanolin formaldehyde etc all right so what's going alright so what's going on why is that that cannabis actually helps relieve the symptoms of eczema well it's possible that the endocannabinoid used in the in the medical study that I mentioned that it's possible that the endocannabinoid cream used in the study reduces the inflammatory response by way of the cannabinoid receptors in addition medical studies have also shown that when topical cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors on the skin it significantly reduces histamine induced itch and vasodilation now just so you know histamine is a now just so you know histamine is a compound you know now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction to go it in response to okay now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in response to an allergic or an inflammatory reaction and it ends up causing vaso to and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is vasodilation and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as vasodilation as I just mentioned which is enough and it ends up causing and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as a vasodilation alright

let's just get right into it so a little bit of a back story before I get into this video this is my job and jazzy and she's my pride and joy she's five years old and she was not socialized properly when she was younger I'd have run throughs younger um and so she has some anxiety and insecurity when it comes to being without their dogs she's just a very high stress dog I know Dobermans as a breed can be a little bit on the higher stress side but she just kind of takes it to another level I'm a dog trainer and she's actually the reason I got into dog training because when she would feel insecure she did attack other dogs um so she kind of got me into dog training and so yeah I was really excited to film this video kind of try to figure out a solution for her problems I have taken her to the vet and they've suggested different medications like Prozac for her and I have not felt good about that it has a sat well with me to put her on a high anxiety medication when she's doing okay I just wanted a little something to take the edge off and to help her be more comfortable on a daily basis so I never really went forward with that I didn't feel good about that I have like to go the natural route and one day I was looking at hemp oil stuff and I heard how good it was not only because it helps with anxiety and pain management cancer prevention and many other things but because it's way safer than fish oil is and has the same omegas that fish oil does so it's a way safer way with way less negative side effects like fish oil has to get them there good fatty acids I already shop to a company called Empire pets they are the cutest I love their packaging and everything I'll show you in a second and I asked them if they would be willing to partner up with me because this video was something I really wanted to make so I was like I might as well reach out I saw really great reviews on their product and yes I'm going to show you their packaging and then we'll talk a little bit more okay so their packaging is so cute and a couple things I want to point out is their first thing it just says hemp oil for pets it's 100% natural it's a supplement and the ingredients are raw organic unrefined hemp seed oil it's cold-pressed and it has the suggested use for your dog's weight compared to how many drops on it which is really nice so for proven benefits it helps with allergies arthritis inflammatory bowel disease heart disease diabetes liver or kidney disease and cancer so that's a lot of great things on here on the package it doesn't say it helps with anxiety but I'm going to be showing you my experience within the last week of how I've seen it help with that here's just one clip a day from every single day of the week to kind of show how it went here we are we have the hemp oil all the dogs are going crazy as always because I said jazzy's name and jazzy really likes food so she's like can you give it to me so we're gonna try this bad boy buster try it like three times a day for best results I think I'm gonna do twice a day morning and night to start she's like yeah I mean do you want it yeah me oh she likes that I've just been giving Josie a little extra food when I give it to her I turn it with the just hemp oil the first day and she liked it but I kind of like giving her a snack I think that's better so all I do is unscrew this hold on then we just drop [Music] just don't just sit Jersey down so I'm here with Jazze we're just chillin watching the show but this is the third day of the hemp seed oil we've been doing it morning and night a little snack after the walks and stuff and I could not believe like if you look at her right now her demeanor is just a lot calmer she isn't pinning her ears back she used to always have her ears pinned back so much anxiety just in the house and as a dog trainer I was walking her hours a day she just it was one of those things where I looked into it because I was like we need something to just take that job and it's completely done that so now I'm on the couch with her she is chillin she's doing all I can see in the face hi Jesse we just got done she went for a walk this morning a training session now she's just chillin like normal and one thing that I just wanted to document really quickly is I think I used to have the preconceived notion that like because it's hemp oil it made them like dosed off they weren't listening as well she is a very very attentive still she's listening super amazing the only difference is she doesn't seem she's shaking she likes to shake thanks for your paw the only difference is she doesn't seem as stressed out as she used to be she's not overthinking things and yeah so I just wanted to point that out because I think I used to think like and trying this I was like oh no what if she isn't able to listen but she just seems a lot more calm and like she's able to enjoy a life a lot more so Josie is come lately obsessed with her homeboy that can serious but so much and it's just I cannot believe how much it's changing her temperament so later jazzy look at how calm good girl Elena jazzy no cheating good girl right now and I just really quick wanted to take a second to say when she walked she's a very challenging dog and she's not even pulling at all she just seems like she's not as stressed out walking she's just enjoying it a lot more and I'm honestly so amazed that she's just this comfortable because she used to have so much anxiety no matter how much we walked and now she's starting her walks off calm let me get the rest okay so now it's the time to talk about how I feel about the last week I'm not gonna be like Tora bearing in this I'm just gonna tell you what kind of happened what I saw and I'm a little nervous honestly just sit down and talk about it because I had such a good experience with hemp oil I saw so many things that I didn't think I was going to and just witnessed so many improvements from it so I was like dang I might come off like preach here like I really want you to get this but I honestly do because I saw so many improvements in jazzy so the one thing I really quick wanted to point out too that I found out was that fish oil actually has a lot of risks in it and the hemp oil has the Omega acid like the fatty acids without the risks so if you're getting your dog on fish oil it's probably better to switch over to hemp oil and I saw so many improvements with Jazze one that I didn't expect to see I don't know why I didn't expect to see this because a lot of use for hemp oil is for pain management and jazzy actually because she is super insecure started in a dog fight one time when she got threatened and her leg got ripped really bad so that's healed up but there's still like scar tissue and she's still wimple on it a little bit when she over exerts herself running in the yard and stuff but with the hemp oil one thing I noticed is she didn't limp ones and the smelling actually that I didn't even know was swelling I thought it was just scar tissue started to go down a little bit more so that was really cool and fascinating to see so hopefully within the weeks to follow it'll keep it going down another thing that I wanted to know is how much better jazzy got at walking and I've been working with her for a year and a half on walking and she's always been good but it's been to the point where I have to keep correcting her a little bit she's always a little bit on edge and this really just took the edge off it made her able to go on walks a lot easier she wasn't stressed and I don't think it really trained her to walk I think the last year and a half has done that but what I think it did do is get her to the point where she was calm before we went on the walk because before the walk was to get her calm and I think adding the hemp oil and as a supplement into her diet really just helped her get to the point where she was calm before we started walking I had a very good experience with hemp oil I'm going to actually start using this on my little dog now too because of just how many improvements I saw I think if you have a dog with any anxiety especially separation anxiety or anxiety around other dogs or just anxiety triggered by the outside world I think it'll be really really beneficial to try hemp oil out and also like I said if you're unofficially I'll definitely try it out make the switch so you're not putting your dog at risk and yeah I'm really excited and I think like another cool thing is how it really helps prevent cancer and a lot of different inflammatory problems that can occur so that's really nice knowing that not only is it helping with her anxiety and a more natural rather than anti-anxiety meds for dogs but it also is having a bunch of little health benefits on jazz that was really nice to know and I feel really comfortable giving this to her which I'm a crazy dog mom so I don't feel comfortable with a lot of things but if you want to get it all the way get down below and yeah I hope you enjoyed this video ok I hope you enjoyed this video I had so much fun making it let me know what you think in the comments down below and if you're willing to try it on your dog which I think you should and yeah today's future claw is going to go to let me look stinky feet geckos so thank you so much for being so supportive I love you and I love all of you and I will see you next video fine", "4IvfaBg_3Kk": "oh my gosh i think this is the salve that i tried of 70s as well this is my favorite this stuff is so

(upbeat music) Good morning y'all, rough morning. I honestly was not planning\nto pick up the camera until I was feeling a little better, but something adorable happened. Harlow, while you are adorable, I'm actually not talking about you. I managed to make it downstairs, and I found this from Judd. This is gorgeous. Got a sailboat, a pink sunset, wow. This is so touching, it says, the card says, with you,\nlife is an adventure, happy Valentine's Day. And he wrote the sweetest most amazing... I'm not gonna share what he\nwrote 'cause it was personal, but you know this is\nnot typically like Judd, the romantic gesture, so I know he put a lot\nof thought into this and, I've got a great man. Alright I have made it to my destination. I need the heating pad, I\nneed my nausea to go down. I will see y'all in a bit. Hey Harlow, you wanna be snuggled, and your nose is like right in my armpit. Well y'all I am feeling a bit better. Harlow actually slept on our\nbed all night last night. Usually she'll get up after awhile 'cause she gets too hot, but I woke up and she was happily\nlaying between Judd and I. She was actually kind of invading Judd's space and like pushing him, so that Judd starting\ncoming into my space. But we made it work. Anyways I've got a\nphysical therapy session and the PT should be here any minute now. And then I'm going to\ntry something new today. Alright I had my physical\ntherapy, it went well. The first thing he asked me is, \"Do you have your AFO's yet?\" And I said no, but my appointment, I'm not sure if I told y'all yet, is Friday to get my AFO's and my joint braces from Hanger Clinic. So, looking forward to that. Anyways as a Valentine's Day treat, I am making Judd some pulled pork, one of his favorite things. The last time I tried to make pulled pork, it went not so great. I cooked it on high instead of low, so the pork really didn't shred well, but I think this one's\nready to be shredded. Oh my goodness, yes, it's\nshredding beautifully. Okay so the secret is to\ncook it on low for six hours instead of high for three hours, ta-dah! Alrighty, so I shredded it up, I put some of this sauce in it, and I actually have a\nrecipe to share with y'all 'cause I was like if I mess this up again, I wanna blame it on a recipe. So I put a link to it in the description, and then I added some Sticky\nFingers Carolina Sweet, and I think he's gonna love it. Alrighty y'all, I said I\nwas trying something new, and here it is. This is my very first shipment of CBD oil. So I've been talking with my\ndoctors about my chronic pain, and we are always looking for new ways to improve my quality of life, and to help me manage my pain, and it had been suggested\nto me to try CBD oil. And if you wanna learn about\nmy pain management plans and past discussions of this, I would check out my\npain management playlist. So originally, I was\nopposed to trying CBD oil because I was worried it\nwould lower my blood pressure, and I already have problems with that. I have to take medications\nto keep my blood pressure up, but I think that was just me\nnot knowing much about CBD oil. Some people it doesn't do anything to BP, some people it goes up, down. We don't know exactly how\nit's going to affect me, but I talked to my pain\nmanagement doctor about it, and he thinks it's at least\na try 'cause many people have had a lot of success with CBD oil, and if it helps me, how\nwonderful would that be, especially since it is natural. Now I did a fair amount\nof research on CBD oil before deciding to do it, and before deciding which company\nI was gonna purchase from, and one of the first\nthings I learned is that many people have very strong opinions on which company is the\nbest to purchase from. And what I think will be\ntrue in this instance, is that every brand can\naffect everyone differently, and you really need to do a little bit of trial and error to see\nwhat works best for you. So the company I decided to go with first is one that a fellow EDS blogger uses, her name is Christina Dougherty, and this company is called Theramu. And if it works well for her, I felt confident in giving it a try to see if it works well for me. Now CBD oil may do nothing for me, I know a lot of people\nhave success with it, but I have spoken with some people who said it really didn't do much. Or it did very little that it\njust wasn't worth the cost. So I am moving forward with\nthis, cautiously optimistic. I really, really want it to work, but I'm not going to get my\nhopes unrealistically high. I like my saying of cautious optimism. If this one really doesn't\ndo anything for me, like I said, different brands\nmay affect you differently, so I will probably try\nat least one more time with a different brand. I was looking at Lazarus\nor Bluebird Botanicals, those look good 'cause they\nhave third party testing on their products, but anyways, this is what I have right now. So this is... It just came in this box, this\ndoesn't fit in our mailbox so they delivered it\nto the leasing office. It was fine, it came with my receipt, and this pretty stuff that looks like, I don't know hamsters would use it, or like birds for nests, whatever. Packaging I guess and\nit came with this box. Now it's open because I\ndid try it last night, I put a drop on my skin first because, you know me, I'm\nprone to allergic reactions, and after awhile, nothing\nhappened with the drop on my skin, so I put one drop under\nmy tongue and went to bed, and I was totally fine. I wanted to try it first last night because, well, that's when it came in, but also Judd was home,\ntoday he's working. And so you open it up,\nand here is the oil. It was facing the right\nway when I first opened it. And I got the Theramu Calm Pro. Which I think just means it's a higher strength\nthan their original. And it is mango flavor,\nand 100% pure hemp extract. Sublingual dietary supplement. 750 milligrams pure hemp extract. And this is one ounce. Supplemental facts, serving\nper container, about 120. Serving size is five drops. So I get one drop under my tongue. The dose would be five. Other ingredients, pure Emu oil, organic mango extract, it's gluten free. Directions say shake well before use as pure ingredients naturally separate. Place five drops under\nthe tongue subliminally. Up to three times a day or as recommended by your\nhealthcare practitioner. Hold under tongue for 20\nseconds before swallowing. Store at room temperature. Does not contain THC. So yes, I'm using CBD oil,\nthere's no THC component which is the component\nthat makes people stoned. And this is legal in all 50 states. If you wanna know about\nprices for this specifically, just check out their website, I'll link it in the description. That's kind of what I worry\nabout, it being cost-prohibitive 'cause it is kind of pricey, and depending on how much\nI need it, but we'll see. I don't even know if it's gonna work yet and some people say it has\nto get into your system, so it takes awhile to\nstart seeing affects, or it works right away. I didn't notice any difference\nyesterday from my one drop, but, oh I forgot to shake it. So we're gonna shake it up. Alright, I got my drops. I'm gonna like open my mouth and use this while y'all are watching me okay. So here we go. And then I leave it under my\ntongue for like 20 seconds. You really can't taste anything, it doesn't really taste\nlike anything to me. Maybe like a hint of mango, but... Has it been 20 seconds yet? Okay I left it for like 30 seconds 'cause I wanted to be safe. But there we go, we shall\nsee how it affects me. No difference yet. (laughs) But I will keep y'all updated\non my journey with CBD oil, I am really, really hoping and praying it will be a good resource\nfor me, but time will tell. Hi y'all, I've made it into bed. I honestly do not feel a\ndifference with the CBD oil. However my pulse is giving\nme lots of issues tonight. Generally my heart rate is 110, 120, 130, so still tachycardic, yes\nmy pulse gives me issues, but it looks like my baseline. Not tonight, I am up in the 160's and Harlow alerted to me twice today, one syncopy I was able to prevent, by laying down and elevating my feet, the other one I couldn't even prevent it, so, I mean I'm okay. Harlow alerted, I was in a safe place, but (sighs) my pulse is bad tonight. And it started to get worse like two hours after I took the CBD oil, but I don't feel the CBD\noil is making my pulse worse because I was having issues\nwith it this morning. And just the nature of the beast I guess. With the CBD oil, I talked to Judd, and kind of our game plan, is that I'm going to finish\nthe bottle from Theramu. The current bottle I have,\nI'm gonna take five drops in the morning and five drops at night. I watched the video. I edited the volume a little bit, and I think I put way more\nthan five drops in my mouth. It's kind of hard to tell, but anyways, I'm going to take it in\nthe morning and at night until the bottle finishes. If I don't see any difference with it, then I will try another brand and I've decided I'll\ntry Lazarus Naturals. And you know I wanna\nreally give it a good try, I'm really hoping it can help me. Also, if y'all have\nbeen watching the news, I'm sure you know that something really tragic happened in Florida. There was a shooting at a high school and it happened in Parkland, which is several hours South from here, but, gosh, it's hard to\nknow exactly what to say when these things happen. It's heartbreaking and\nwe feel it, I'm sure, all through Florida and\nthrough this nation, and my prayers are with everyone affected. Snuggling Harlow close to me tonight. She's also very attached to me because I'm not feeling\nwell with my pulse. I'm actually gonna be running\nan extra liter tonight to hopefully help with it\nso when I wake up tomorrow I'm hopefully not struggling as much. Anyways, I'm going to bed, so with that I'll say goodnight, and thanks for joining\nus on our adventure. (upbeat music)", "WekMGzxRPig": "hi I'm dr. Dani Gordon and welcome to\ndr. Dani TV and this is the Cannabis wellness show where I talk about all\nthings cannabis and CBD I'm a medical doctor and I specialize in something\ncalled integrated medicine which is\nevidence-based natural medicine and in cannabis medicine and I've treated\nthousands of patients with medical cannabis in CBD over the years and this\nis where I share all of that knowledge with you so in this episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about CBD used for chronic pain so how can CBD help chronic\npain conditions what kind of chronic pain conditions it helps with and which\nones it may not be so helpful with and then we're going to talk about how to\nactually use CBD and the experiences I've had using high CBD types of hemp in\nmedical cannabis with my patients with chronic pain so this is a question I get\nasked all of the time in facebook groups by email and of course with my patients\nis they really want to try to use CBD and usually in an oil forms of CBD oil\nfor their chronic pain now there's some CBD oils that you can get\nover-the-counter in some countries that are from hemp and they don't have any\nTHC in it or less than 0.2 percent THC so basically none and then there's the\nmedical cannabis that really has high high high CBD low THC but does it a\nlittle bit of detectable THC in it let's say 1% THC so in my medical practice in\nCanada where medical cannabis is legal I use a lot of very high CBD very low THC\noils to help patients with chronic pain now chronic pain it's a just a huge\nbroad area of medicine because there's so many areas where pain can come from\npain can come from the nervous system being injured and come from the nerves\ncalled neuropathic pain or nerve pain it can come from inflammation so if someone\nwho has an autoimmune disease or they have arthritis from just wear and tear\nthey can all get different types of pain and you have pain in the nerve endings\nand you have pain in the body and then you have pain that starts in the brain\nthat's again something called central pain so with all of these different\ntypes of pain actually one of the most important systems in our body to manage\npain is our own cannabis system in our body our endocannabinoids system so what\nthis means is that when we are facing pain whether it's chronic pain or acute\npain there's molecules in our body there's\nchemicals our body makes to help fight that pain and our body makes cannabis\nlike compounds cannabis like molecules called endocannabinoids it helps to\nreally regulate our pain perception how we kind of perceive pain and also how\npain really changes the brain over time so a really common question I get is you\nknow what should I do when I've already tried CBD from somewhere over the\ncounter from a hemp store for example for my chronic pain and it didn't do\nanything does that mean that cannabis medicine in general and CBD in general\nit just can't help me the answer is usually no usually the answer is that it\nprobably can be helpful somewhat but it really depends on the type of CBD the\nconcentration of CBD it's different for every person in every pain condition and\na lot of other factors like was it a full spectrum cannabis medicine product\nwith lots of different chemicals in it besides the CBD or was a just CBD\nwithout anything else like a CBD islip what I find with a lot of chronic pain\nconditions is because CBD actually interacts with our own cannabis system\nin our own bodies called the endocannabinoid system it doesn't\nactually turn pain off directly like a painkiller for example what it does\ninstead is it down regulates our perception of pain and the kind of tones\nour our nervous system so to speak so it can help with chronic pain over a period\nof time but often times it might take weeks or months to see in effect and it\ndoesn't cure chronic pain so you have to keep taking it so what can happen with a\nlot of people is they start taking a very small amount of CS CBD oil and they\ndon't really see much difference if anything oftentimes they have to use a\ndifferent dose a different product or sometimes adding a tiny bit of THC\nso using in Canada for example where this is legal a strain of cannabis oil\nthat has a tiny bit of THC and still very very high amount of CBD actually\nworks better for chronic pain in many cases because it actually binds directly\nto some of the the pain receptors using the THC and then the CBD makes the THC\nwork even better even at these tiny little doses so normally even at those\ntiny doses of THC people don't normally feel impaired or high so a lot of times\npeople think that CBD oil is going to work directly for their chronic pain but\nagain because CBD actually doesn't bind to either one of the cannabis like\nreceptors in our body the cb1 or the CBT receptor like THC does it works in a\nmore kind of overall toning capacity like a lot of herbal medicines it's all\nabout really toning the nervous system and this is where CBD can be helpful\nover time there's also still so much we don't know about CBD and about the\ncannabis plant in general we're really only at the beginning of our scientific\nunderstanding and this is really I mean I mean when I say the beginning I mean I\nread the most up-to-date cutting-edge research every week on this topic and\nI'm still feeling like you know we're really at the beginning so that being\nsaid how can you actually use CBD if you have chronic pain well one way that you\ncan use it is you can help use it to help decrease the anxiety that comes\nwith chronic pain because what happens when you have chronic pain is in the\nback of your mind even though your brain gets used to having chronic pain it\ntakes up so much bandwidth in your brain so much mental and brain energy to\nbasically dampen the pain signals so you can just go about your life and not feel\nlike you're in constant trauma that over time it can cause a lot of brain anxiety\nand it can cause a lot of fatigue so what I find seem to be helpful with when\nsomeone has chronic pain one of the ways there's many but one of the ways is\nhelping to decrease the brain anxiety levels so basically it helps kind of\ncalm their brain down which dampens the fight-or-flight response or you know the\ndanger response system in the brain and that also dampens pain signals and it\nalso dampens our pain perception because when you have chronic\nyour nervous system is on edge all of the time it's like you're caught in this\nfight or flight running away from a saber-toothed tiger cycle all of the\ntime and everything is heightened so your awareness of everything of sounds\nof smells of bright lights and of pain everything gets amplified so basically\nit just helps kind of calm everything down a notch and even in itself that's\nreally helpful with chronic pain sufferers another way that can actually\nhelp chronic pain is if the chronic pain has an inflammation component so that's\nactually most types of chronic pain even indirectly if you have nerve pain\nsometimes there's an inflammation component as well so what CBD does in\nanimal models we know and we think in humans although we need really bigger\nresearch studies to say exactly how this works but it's probably very similar to\nwhat we're seeing in animal models is that CBD actually works on inflammation\nthrough a number of different pathways in the body so it can shut down\ninflammation in some pathways so if pain is coming from inflammation CBD used\ndaily over time may help reduce inflammation and that kind of pain as\nwell another factor in many forms of chronic pain even if you didn't start\nout this way is the longer the pain goes on the nervous system tries to adapt to\nthe pain and basically your own endocannabinoid system in your other\npain control systems they get out of whack they just don't work as well and\nthey kind of reach this new baseline this new kind of dysregulated baseline\nof I'm okay but actually the nervous system is really just regulated so this\nis where CBD may be able to help again because it may be able to help rebalance\nthe endocannabinoids system when it's gotten out of whack so the last thing\nthat I'm just gonna mention is okay what types of chronic pain do I see enjoy\ntreat with medical cannabis and high CBD strains especially so I see quite a\nvariety of chronic pain conditions one of the really interesting things that\nI've noticed in my clinical work with patients and this is not something\nthat's really in the published literature yet is after someone's\nreceived chemotherapy for cancer in many cases they use different drugs that\nreally affect numbness and tingling and burning sensations of burning pain\nthe hands and the feet and this is kind of a neuropathic or nerve type of pain\nthat specifically people get after a lot of chemo therapies especially the breast\ncancer chemotherapy regimens and what I've found is when patients use CBD oil\nafter they finish their chemo and they keep using it their pain their burning\npain in their hands and their tingling pain in their hands and their feet tend\nto tend to go away a lot quicker then I would say on average so it may be really\na place specifically receiveed II show some promise there's some animal studies\non that type of pain specifically using CBD and we need more research to say\nexactly how it works in humans but it's really promising another type of pain\nthat I treat is fibromyalgia I also treat arthritis pain and pain that's\nassociated with a lot of other chronic diseases so I'm gonna talk about each of\nthose in another video specifically but in general I think for chronic pain CBD\nholds a lot of promise especially when it's combined with other\nchemicals in the cannabis plant and potentially with other herbals and other\nmedications so if you like this video please subscribe to our Channel and

lot of chatter about medical marijuana but one doctor here Marin says it's not about getting high it's about getting well and he thinks he's on to something yes dr. Michael Moskowitz believes he has identified a rare component of marijuana called THC V that he says is helping one of his diabetic patients a patient whose blood sugar levels varies between 50 and 1000 in a single day it's not clear but it appears on a preliminary basis for the first month that he that he did that his the the extent of how much he varied seems to be less THC v is found in this subspecies of marijuana called black beauty its leaves are much darker than most marijuana this is a single bud nearly 11 inches long and although she doesn't have diabetes Nina Murphy has chronic neck and back pain she used to treat with meds I was a little skeptical I haven't used marijuana before so it's not something that I was just gonna jump into I'm extremely pleased and I hope to be off my meds in the next couple of months dr. Moskowitz says more study needs to be done with a black beauty it's just having the opportunity to work with something that clearly has therapeutic value but figuring out how to optimize that and make that work the best for the most number of people that's very exciting the doctor travels to Miami next week speaking at a conference to discuss his findings in San Rafael Don Ford KPIX 5", "9p2UNon_dvo": "next into the den to entrepreneurs weary of one particular dragon we are worried about Peter because he's really scary oh he doesn't go for the kill but to survive in the den they'll also have to face the fire of four other dragons [Music] hello dragons my name is Michael Tkach and I'm Tim in skip and we're from Caron UK we're asking for an investment of fifty thousand pounds for 15% of our business we have the UK rights to the current portfolio products which are all made from cannabis sativa plant extract make how would you like to explain your story I am from the Czech Republic and I was working in the UK when industrial accident changed my life I damaged my arm and I lost several fingers on my hand amazing an injured surgeons transferred a tow from my foot to my hand during that times the pain was unbearable and the scarring was extensive visiting Frank from the Czech Republic brought me the car own appointment and another hemp products I started using them and their results was incredible so I like to share this experience with others and I approached current Czech Republic and brought these products to UK so we have 18 different products ranging from face cream shower gel hemp leaf tea and hemp seeds and they're all made from cannabis sativa commonly known as hemp we are vegan organic and totally legal as the products contain none of these psychoactive elements found in in cannabis but they're very high in the other elements known as cannabinoids which are currently proven to be beneficial in treating many different complaints we're passionate about cannabis sativa but we are plainly retail amateurs and we need the help of a dragon to guide us to manage our growth and fulfill our full potential thank you very much for your attention and we have some samples if you'd like to show what possible that we have the samples at the end is because I'm slightly worried if I have to take any of the samples I might make a wrong investment decision they have no suckers apical affect whatsoever yeah now they've reassured the dragons the products aren't mind-altering Tim inskipp and me Celtic arch can get on with the business of handing them out there looking for 50,000 pounds for 15% of their business selling cosmetics made with a cannabis extract but Pizza Jones is still confused about the legalities of the operation how can you convince me that this isn't a potential front for a big drug ring we have the we have EU sensitive all youth certification all the farmers are certified there's very strict law oversee these farmers what's stopping the company in Czech Republic the temptation to realize that they make a small amount of money on this but the real business behind the scenes is cannabis they grow into different blind entirely and it's it is illegal to grow different plants what Moe would make it restricted is the level of THC which is the psychoactive component of the hemp plant which it doesn't have so essentially it's legal it's not a restricted substance okay so I'm not gonna be an investor in some sort of illegal drug no absolutely not because of you're gonna go to our butter and you've given three different creams here the ones are bomb as let's bomb yeah and then these are its anointment is it all the same product sit no okay is this a cosmetic is it a medicine at the moment we marketed as the cosmetics we don't make her claims it helps people and we sell it out isn't that a major problem because a you can't tell anyone what the product does you just said it's an all-purpose hemp pointment I don't know if it's to moisturize and make my skin glow I don't know if wish to reduce pain for you know joint pain or injuries I've got this does have medical device certification in the EU in Czech Republic they have run the trials we are talking specifically about this product to get a medical device in the okay the point is that the evidence is that it does help in a very very wide range of different complaints and problems but we cannot say that we are going to cure any of this but you definitely can't say they don't have a medicines license to say that but what I'm saying is that you don't know what the products for who owns the company Karen know my friends in the Czech Republic your friends yes how much of the company do you own none none we'll check it probably nothing nothing basically our relationship is that macao developed some of the products in the Czech Republic brought them over to the UK and tell me what's your deal with this company they are my close friends so you've got to buy from them yes is there a minimum quantity of to buy no and your license with them is lost for how long - 2023 at the moment and can they terminate your contract early turn up now can I look at that agreement yes yes Tim what's your role in this business are you are you an equal share holder no I'm a minor shoulder at the moment the shareholders split how I only have 10% yeah I got a 90 and 10 I got a 60% of the company and we got another of my no shareholders which helped me on the beginning will be the start of the company and how much would they put in to help you from the beginning there was no more than 20,000 altogether I invest my owner over nearly 200,000 in in the business two hundred thousand pounds and what who's where has that been spent unwisely I did a lot of mistakes on the beginning I hired Ireland the warehouse ten and half thousand thousand square feet much big offices and hired people because I believe because I were watching the Dragons Den I want to do big it's all fall then there's Peters fault specifically no launching is for the SETI's well this is my time thank you so it's Peters that fall so he's not your favorite dragon that's good to hear so you made some mistakes in the beginning so how much would you write off of the 200,000 as a mistake [Music] a hundred thousand for sure right now you have absolutely no negotiating tools in here whatsoever on June the 3rd 2023 if you've done a cracking job you hand this business back to these guys there's nothing in here that gives you an automatic right of renewal from my point of view they will be only against themselves how they can do it without us after years well because you built their brand they've got a really really valuable asset over here why on earth were they renew mm-hmm job done market penetrated I'm not spending my time building somebody else's brand for them they won't be investing I'm out a lack of control over the future of the business has spooked Deborah Medan and it's left to KO suleiman wondering how an investor would get their money back my question mark here is the fact that you don't own the brand it's a distribution and there could be no exits yes well we believe at the moment the exit is to sell back to Karen check have you got agreement to that we are negotiate that agreement so you haven't got any grieve now look I'm not doubting the product amazing product as you say but you don't own the brand once you've created the brand the retail is what the brand I don't care about you I do wish you all the best because you're gonna make your friend rich I'm out okay touka Suleiman joined Deborah Medan in exiting over that controversial distribution contract antes Levani has some words of wisdom on the pair's plans to back up the potential benefits of the product products like this the most important thing is to show the effectiveness that it works you will need to do clinical trials and pretty much every region or territory that you launch it because it will have different licensing agencies and the cost of doing a clinical trial do you know much that costs in the UK to do a clinical trial like this about a hundred twenty thousand exactly to get them licensed will cost you a hell of a lot more you're gonna have to raise half a million pounds I'm at okay thank you okay thank you Michele Tim I'm concerned about the way that you've gone about setting this business up the hill particularly you where you've having friendships and in your home country is fantastic but what you should have done was if you had such a huge amount of money two hundred thousand pounds to invest you should have found a way to invest in the holding company in the Czech Republic I could have been potentially interested actually in something like this but ultimately you've brought a distribution agency style deal that I think isn't good enough so I'm out okay thank you Peter Jones's departure leaves Jenny Campbell as the last dragon standing is she able to see the potential for profit in a business her fellow millionaires have shunned so I mean this is a bit of a mess isn't it from where we're standing I'm sure you can see that you come into the den with a an exclusivity agreement you're halfway through and all sorts of issues on extending or minimum purchase levels how confident are you that you can renegotiate that exclusivity agreement on the book Alfie on a hundred percent confident okay so I think this is complex but I can see the belief in your eyes Mikkel and certainly you've come onboard to him with the same belief but I will make you an offer so I will offer you all of the money but because of the risk factors multiple risk factors in this deal I would want 25% of your business the garage for offer can we have a little discussion please go talk to the wall an eleventh-hour change of Fortune as Jenny Campbell backs her gut instinct with an offer but at 10% more than the entrepreneurs were offering they have a tricky decision on their hands thank you - for your offer be able to accept the offer [Applause] welcome to the cosmetic duo have given up a quarter of the company but leave the den with a 50,000 pound investment that's what we lost it I did say you shouldn't use their product before I can't wait to have a fancy yeah you'd like to meet Jenny as silly as possible it's pre share our excitement and our visions and maybe have a bottle of champagne yeah you", "_ABl8fOLuHw": "[Music] hello friends I am excited today because we're going to talk about a fun subject marketing I believe that as you start your CBD business one of the most important things that you need to focus on is what you're going to do in the marketing side of your business and there's nobody better to learn from than my son our chief marketing officer and our partner with joy organics and so Jared I'm glad you're here today to talk about some fun things that's really yeah we we sometimes laugh that we've got the two funnest jobs because marketing and sales are the two funnest parts of the company and then you know my poor brother he has operations and there's not much fun happening over there and of course your mother she's got a fun job too so anyhow let's talk about you know basically marketing 101 the very basics of what people need to be thinking about what they need to know as they're starting their cvd business many of these people are just getting started others have started and you know now we're looking for ideas on marketing so you know when you think about this topic what comes to your mind what's important yeah the first thing that comes to my mind and I just read this the other day is that marketing is all about finding the voice of your customer and you know in order to do that you have to first understand who you're targeting you know what ages are you targeting what demographic you know what are some other interests that they have because so much of what we do in marketing today is targeting specific segments you know we've moved well beyond just mass marketing where you throw up a billboard or a TV ad you took your marketing everybody you can really dial in on a specific segment of people and that's what you want to do first is you want to really determine who we're on a market ooh and then the second question that you have to ask yourself is where are these people right now you know how can I get for them is it and ratting a certain website that they visit is an email blast is it you know PPC or something else but those are really the two core fundamental questions that I would you know ask myself if I were studying business today you know it's it's interesting when we started we were kind of a one-size-fits-all company you know we weren't real clear on who we wanted to target because a lot of this data just wasn't available and now as I look at the the evolvement of the industry I think it is even more important than ever to get real clear on what you're wanting to do kind of what your specialty is going to be I saw that we had a new customer came in today from the golf business and I was thinking you know somebody could just focus on you know golf pro shops and that golf niche and you know we've got you know somebody as you know that focuses on one segment of the sports market and the gentleman in that area it is true the people who are very clear on who they want to target you know they can then begin to build all their messaging around that and make sure they're where these people are absolutely I mean you know it's it's it's a mistake that most people make because they think have to go after everybody in order to may have a successful business but you're exactly right I mean our number one I would label partner targets what I think is a very very small there is no segment in the market and it just goes to show you it's not about mass marketing to everybody it's about finding that core voice for your target market you know I think one of the companies in the industry that's done this really good is for you and you know they have definitely targeted the women I mean if you're a man you're pretty much feeling like you're on the outside there but they're doing great just targeting that women you know that that market you have any thoughts on that excitement we both read their emails on it's so true and it's funny you know they just sent us an email the other day and it was like the subject line was so uncomfortable for a man I was like I'm not even gonna open that because it was it's clearly you know they they have honed in on who they want and that's what you want to do we even talked to chief marketing officer of a very fast great brand the other day and he said you know so much of marketing strategy is determining what you want to say no to and that's exactly what they've done Lauria has said no to men and in doing so women feel like you're talking to me you understand me so that's what they've done a really nice job with that and so you know put yourself in the position of somebody who's just starting the CBD business or maybe they started one and they've not gotten real clear on this what advice would you give them on how they can kind of figure out what is their niche or what could their area special TV yeah I would start by really looking at yourself insane what skills do I bring to the market and where are my interests you know I had a conversation just a couple weeks ago with a with a gentleman who's becoming a private label partner and this particular guy you know how to identified a very narrow segment that he wanted to target in his background and his skill set was in sales in actually cold calling businesses and I said you know that's what you should do because we were talking about SEO we were talking about banners we're talking all these are the things and I'm like tell me about yourself where are your skills and I can just tell me about that I said listen if I were you I get a website set up and I would go after that small little market you could literally make millions a year in this small little market and just start cold calling these guys start knocking on some doors so I would look at you know where your interests are I would really narrow in on one specific market and then I would say you know where my skill stuff that's what we did my skill set was with us you know that's where we started that's what got the business off the ground was really just honing in and focusing on where I felt like I was best in the world that and I would encourage people to do the same and so if somebody says that you know I'm really good in this one segment I've got yours experience in this it's an area of great interest to me you know what should they be thinking about in kind of putting together all the marketing materials and you know beginning to watch their business or you know taking their business to the next level yeah well I would start by thinking about marketing first this is one of the you know common mistakes we see in just most businesses these days as they you know think about marketing last who they're gonna market to how they're gonna market to them and I would say it really used to be the first thing this this is before your label because ultimately your label should reflect the target market that you want to attract so I would be thinking about all of these things first and then after that together they'll put together your business plan put together everything else cuz it's all going to stem from the customer and who's gonna buy family you know just thinking saying here one of our top customers is another person who's just focused on the pharmacy market so using this as an example if I'm starting my business and for whatever it is I've got some background in the pharmacy world or connections or influence and I say that's what I'm going after and that's what he did and he had built his whole website everything is talking to pharmacist and so you know that's an example of hey if I'm gonna target a market I got to build everything around and I got to build on my imagery my content everything around that market I'm targeting exactly that's right in any any thoughts that go through your mind you know on that so that you know well you know it kind of goes back to my agency days so before this I ran an agency and I targeted primarily personal injury law firms and that's a very very narrow market most of the SEO companies when I got started retargeting everybody and so the the thing that makes that so attractive is that what a personal injury lawyer came to my website I spoke to that I said I understand you and I understand how to win in your market and that's what exactly what these guys are doing with the pharmacist is they're speaking to the pharmacy or the pharmacy fire and when they read the content there's so much more likely to buy and convert that prospect because they understand the language that they're using you know I've heard many years ago and that is if you have a headache would you rather have a pain reliever or a pain reliever for headaches right so you know when people feel like you're talking to them connecting to them that you specialize in their market they're gonna be that much more attracted you and even on an SEO side if you're let's just take the the you know the pharmacy market or you let's take your your specialty in personal injury law then all the keyword phrases everything you were targeting were for personal injury attorney exactly exactly and when that particular company wants to do maybe a mass email outreach to pharmacies they're gonna look like the experts and that's what you want to do that's what you want to convey to your prospects is we're the experts on this particular topic so that when you communicate that to them at residence well obviously this has been very insightful and for those of you who are running your own business I hope you've got some really good ideas at least from a standpoint of getting clear on what's going to make you unique and different in the marketplace what's going to separate you who's your market and I think you know when we just to kind of follow up when we were meeting with this chief marketing officer the other day of this four hundred million dollar value company one of the things he also said is go where your market is and so you know one of the analogies he used was Red Bull and you know Red Bull started you know obviously is an energy drink but then they were everywhere that their target market was at the marathon's at the boat races and everything else actly exactly yeah that's perfect that's that's exactly what you want to do all right well this is CBD marketing 101 with Jared Smith I hope you watch our other videos that we're going to record next on search engine optimization on website design and on label design so thank you so much for watching [Music] you [Music]", "WcbyFtWh7DI": ">>> >>> WELCOME >>> WELCOME BACK. >>> WELCOME BACK.\nWE >>> WELCOME BACK.\nWE ARE >>> WELCOME BACK.\nWE ARE HEARING

through my experience using CBD oil I've been using it for about a month now so I thought it was about time I share my experience with you guys and yet share if there's been any benefits for my skin so the CBD oil that I've been using is by Zen CBD I picked this up in Planet organic so any of you guys given the UK or live in London then CBD is stocked in Planet organic and yeah and you can pick this up I think the reason I picked this up is because it was firstly a really good price it would being discounted from I think 30 pounds to 20 pounds and I say a good price that it's still super expensive but yeah I went in there and actually spoke to a sales consultants and they taught me through the different options I'm I explained of what I wanted to use it for I liked the fact that I hadn't ever used cbz or before so they recommended this one it's a fairly low strength I think it's between 3 to 5 percent obviously it determines how much you use I've been using 1 to 2 sprays I started with one spray and I've built up to two so yeah this is the one that I've been using like with other supplements I think it's really beneficial to actually speak to somebody who actually sells the product or is experienced in using the product just because they'll be able to give you like an honest opinion or an honest review on which of those sort of things actually work which kind of brands might be more suitable for what you need them for so yeah like I said I started on a low percentage and that's what I've been using I know that you can build this up but for me I just wanted to start with yeah the lowest strength and just see how that worked for me first so the potential benefits because obviously there's a reason I wanted to try this in the first place I had read so many positive reviews on how this had really been able to help people manage day-to-day stress anxiety and a ton of other really great health benefits for me I've noticed such a huge correlation between my acne flaring up and like my emotional well-being like how much stress I'm under so I really wanted to find something that could help me yeah just manage the day-to-day stresses of life lots of people have reported that they've been able to lower inflammation that they've been able to regulate sebum production and tons of other really great things to your skin as well so yeah I wanted to give this a test see if it actually works and that's exactly what I've done for the last month so the lady that's we this in the shop instructed me to spray once two sprays underneath my tongue and hold it there for sixty seconds and that is exactly what I've been doing I haven't actually applied this topically to my skin because oil is for me really a clogging I know that some people have like miraculous results and are able to clear their skin using things like the oil cleansing method I've tried that but it just does nothing for my skin it just does not work it just makes me produce more oil it makes me feel really greasy and honestly I just I just know it doesn't work for me so if you want to apply this directly to your skin and see if there's any benefits for you then please come and report back because I'm just not going to put myself ones of that experiment but I'd love to know from you guys if that has helped your acne and yeah if you've seen any improvements in your skin so the first thing that I wanted to mention that I've seen as a result of using CBD oil is that my digestion has definitely improved now if you've been following my channel or you'd follow me over on Instagram then you will know that my digestive health has definitely been something that's been playing up since about November last year I've had all kinds of things going on from IBS to a chronic acid reflux and yeah I've just found that using CBD oil has really minimized any flare-ups I've had of those things like for example my acid reflux was really bothering me every single day all day from about January the first all the way through till the end of kind of April and it's no coincidence I've started using CBD oil and I've been able to just relax about it a bit more and I'm not saying it's completely gone please believe me it hasn't it isn't a miracle but it's definitely helped like I don't feel like I'm dealing with it all day every day it kind of comes in waves sometimes but yeah that has been the most exciting benefit I found of using CBD oil and yeah quite excited to see if I continued to use it and what will happen I've also noticed that my severe bloating which I get at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon every single day until I eat dinner and yeah it just continues to get worse and worse so that has definitely been something that's improved to I've also been kind of monitoring why I've been eating I keep a acne diary so I wanted to kind of when I'm breaking out the sort of things I'm eating how I'm feeling all the sort of things that could be tribute to a break out and I've noticed as well because I've been monitoring my in there as well that this is actually reduced as well since using CBD and again yeah it might be a coincidence but I really believed that actually the stress I put myself under about my health has reduced because of using CBD oil this is also really exciting because lots and lots and lots of studies have been done on acne and digestive health and they definitely have found correlations between the two so if you're somebody that struggles with your digestive health and you also struggle with breaking out then this could be a really really exciting thing for you to try and could potentially really heal up your skin another positive side effect I had for about a week was I started to have really great sleep like I was sleeping super quickly fall into a deep sleep and I felt very well rested when I woke up I wish I could say that this lasted throughout the whole month but honestly it didn't I feel like after the first month it sorry after the first month after the first week it kind of just sort of subsided and I just went back to my usual sleeping pattern I haven't slept really badly or anything I don't find that it's really kind of like given me that feeling before sleep where I just yet feel completely knocked out and just really well rested however lots of other people have said that this is an absolute miracle worker when it comes to insomnia and really bad sleeping patterns so if that's you then potentially you could give this a go potentially maybe I need to use a higher dose so I need to take it slightly further in the evening towards bed I've been taking it just after I've eaten probably like 15 minutes after I've eaten so that you're digesting the CBD oil with food I think actually on the bottle it says between meals and let me just check yeah it does actually say on the bottle to defy spray in between meals for best effects spray under tongue so potentially I could have taken this nearer towards bed as opposed to nearer towards dinner and maybe that would have helped me with my sleep better so the next thing the big thing for me that I really wanted to see some help with was reducing anxiety and just reducing like how you handle day-to-day stress so for me this is definitely the biggest one I've been wondering this very very carefully and I know lots of people have said that this is like amazing and has really helped them I honestly believe for the first few weeks it was most definitely helping I felt really well rested like I said and yeah just fell I don't know a little bit more able to cope with certain things and I just wasn't kind of like I don't know letting stress take over my life however for the last few weeks I just don't think that has been the case I would love to say that this has been like again a miracle-worker maybe I need to be taking a higher strength I don't know but yeah I haven't found that this is like miraculously help me manage stress and like I said at the beginning of this video if you're taking this because of stress it's also because you really want to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups you pads for me I've definitely noticed I've been breaking out around my jawline and around my kind of ears with the more kind of deep cystic spots so I haven't noticed a big improvement in CBD oil and my skin today I'm actually feeling like I'm really happy with my skin but this week hasn't been great but it's also worth noting that lots of things that help your skin that you take internally don't just work overnight and that is the case for like supplements that's the case for things like I keep saying that's the case for the pill nothing works within like a month usually so potentially if I take this for longer which I really plan to do to see if there are any additional benefits I think the three-month mark is really a good indication about whether something can really work for your skin however I also tried things for three months and they've absolutely not worked I'm looking at you best your book so yeah if you feel like something's actually making your skin worse than probably best to stop I've tried tons of other things that help me reduce my stress and my acne as well so I think the biggest trial for me was coffee like I am a coffee addict guys I know it can increase anxiety I stick to one cup a day but it really is something I look forward to and I love but last year I actually tried to give it up for two weeks and it was very very difficult guys I've actually filmed an entire blog looking at me quitting coffee the benefits I might have had in my anxiety in my skin and in fact our link it on screen now somewhere around here so go and check it out let me know what you think and I will see you over there I don't know if it tastes that nice I mean really no it doesn't taste like coffee that's for sure hmm just tasted", "oKQGYOtTPeo": "[Music] and now for this one like the title says I'm going to be using a crock-pot I'm going to do maybe a cup maybe a little more of the coconut oil and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw this coconut oil whatever your heart desires thanks for chilling on truebloods TV check out one of these videos click the link and i'll catch you on the next [Music]", "vTxhYYPIVB0": "hello y'all so we're also live streaming on the Internet so there's a bunch of people here with us you can't see and at the end we'll have a lot of time for Q&A so I'll work to speak with you all for about 45 minutes and and then have a good chunk for for Q&A there at the end and then the internet will be joining us for for Q&A also so well my name is Devon Alvarez and I am the owner and founder of this company straight hemp and that's a picture of me there and our hemp fields in Colorado I'm really happy because those plants smell really really good and I know they're gonna help a lot of people and we're actually cutting down our crop right now up there and and so we're gonna talk a little bit today about my personal background and why I'm here and I think it's probably a story a lot of us share unfortunately and we're gonna talk about how these things are making a difference for people and we're going to talk about some some foundational knowledge that really is getting at kind of clearing up some of the confusion in the industry right now there's a lot of new terms and concepts and our goal is to really have you walk away from this learning something and understanding how to better utilize all the products out there and also you know as well as ours and and get educated and then also if anyone here is open to it we'll open it up for testimonials at the end we had some really interesting things come up yesterday's talk down in Greenville so I so I'm a southern boy myself I grew up in North Florida and so being here with you today is really a dream come true I grew up in Jacksonville and I came from a long line of southerners long line of military leaders all the way back to the American Revolution and my career path actually did not start in him started in the US Air Force where I was a an officer training at the US Air Force Academy back in the early 2000s and I was following in the footsteps of my father's before me and I encountered cannabis for the first time in Boulder Colorado and it opened up a new it opened up a new way of thinking about about things and you know before I was training to kill men for the government and take over you know now you know control national assets and that whole sort of thing and it just started seeming she seemed kind of crazy after a while and and not really what are call tribe needed when I looked around what was going on in our culture it was clear that that we needed to do something else and cannabis and him are a tool that allow us to essentially you know fight a battle of hearts and minds I mean that's really how how wars are won that's something that I learned working with those people and what I saw happening in my own home and on the streets in Jacksonville was was just total atrocity and so we're gonna talk a little bit about why we're here today and so hmm well the picture didn't come up for some reason let me pause this for a second I'm actually gonna need to pull up a different something did not format hang on a second technical difficulties so here who here is currently using a CBD product almost everyone who isn't using a CBD product are you open to trying them maybe it depends on how tonight goes huh well if I wasn't sweating before I am now that's funny hang on a second Thanks okay let's start again hi I'm Devin Alvarez with straight him we're gonna be talking tonight about CBD it's did you know that CBD helps with public speaking like 9 out of 12 people and I can tell you right now it's working so why are we here today these it's these are some of my family members that's my grandfather there he died of a drug overdose alcohol took his life and made a lot of our lives living hell that's my stepfather Randy he was prescribed opiates for his back pain from the doctors never told they were that addictive ended up dying from a fentanyl overdose 2016 left my mother widowed s my best friend Spencer there from my time in the Air Force he died from a opiate and meth overdose my stepfather Billie also died from a drug overdose so it was really everywhere not only in my family but all over in the community I was from you know with the whole pill mill and the whole opioid epidemic and really just these these bad drugs and here are some numbers that are really shocking you know there are currently two and a half million people diagnosed in this country right now with opioid use disorder there are 80 deaths each day I just got a call from my brother last week about some people on his jobs that recently died from some drug overdoses and so it's not a good thing how many people here have been touched by this if you feel comfortable raise your hand yeah almost every one of us right and if we're all touched by that all of us are touched by that I mean two and a half million people is 10% of the adult population you know so we're gonna talk about some things tonight that uh I'm not gonna claim that this treats or cures any disease but but I am going to share some things that happen with my family that really are miraculous and can happen with others so CBD shows promise in in helping to treat opiate addiction and other types of addictions and many other kinds of disorders but first of all we'll talk about my mother that's my mother there she was addicted to opiates for ten years these were prescribed the doctor and they never told her how addictive they were she fell into that cycle she was a waitress worked on her feet she needed something to help her and if she if she used marijuana or HAMP or cannabis or anything you know she'd go to jail and lose custody of us right so she used these doctor prescribed drugs and it ruined her life for a decade and I have been I've actually not told this story uh and it's important that I'm here to share this message with you today and she used our products and she was able to get clean you know and it's not just our products there are other great hemp products out there that can help people in this way and we just frankly can't wait on establishment thinking anymore it gave us the opiate epidemic in the first place and it's not solving our problems so you know beyond this kind of message of you know despair there's a message of hope in here and my mothers are what really wonderful example of that she's been clean for over a year now and it's totally changed it's completely changed and if you look into the research out there CVD actually deletes two types of opioid receptors from the brain Kappa and the MU receptors right so there are a lot of there's a lot of doctors out there in the medical addiction field the addiction medicine field that believe that you know once you're once you have a opiate addicted brain you're just always gonna be that way but I'm here to tell you it's just not true you can change it fundamentally and CBD and him can help with that and so like I said we don't have time to wait on establishment thinking that's why I'm here today fundamentally is because I saw a need in our community and I decided that I was gonna go out there and get something for them and bring it back and so that's why I'm really happy to be here in the southeast in my home sharing this message so a little bit more about me and my background I just wasn't a guy that you know had a rough time with his family and decided to go go go grow him I have a so I have background in the military but from there I went on to earn a master's degree in biotechnology where I work for the Defense Department producing biofuels from micro micro algae and wastewater and that laid really laid the foundation for my scientific training which then led me to Colorado in 2012 four of all an American microbiology conference where I was talking about the microalgae work and there I met with a Denver cop it was 2012 and I was talking to him and he's telling me all about the changing laws and he ended up lighting a joint for me and having a conversation I was just like wow this place is totally different and I need to get up here and support these progressive policies if we're ever gonna you know help to bring healing back to our people and mm-hmm so I finished up my lab work and I got up there as just as quick as I could to get started in the industry and the first place I started out was with a place called Agri core labs it was a third-party testing lab so it was essentially it was when quality control was first meeting cannabis for the first time and so we had the privilege of translating pharmaceutical quality control into the burgeoning new industry and there was a lot of room to improve we'll just say that and it was through that experience that I really wasn't satisfied with the industry or the government's ability to deliver safe and effective products in a consistent way at that time so I decided I just set out and start a company myself and we could control the quality at the end of the day so ultimately straight hemp is mission here is to help healing by giving everyone access to the best remedies Nature has to offer and hemp is really just the beginning of a whole plant-based revolution in medicine that we're gonna see in the next decade and we're fundamentally here to make a difference in as many lives as possible and I'm pleased to announce that we've just formed a partnership with an addiction Center in Jacksonville Florida to initiate clinical studies on detox the deletion of these opioid receptors we were just telling you about and some of these other comorbid factors that happen with those types of disease states like anxiety and insomnia so it has a huge potential for everyone I know we've been talking a lot about addiction for a moment but fundamentally there are a lot of kinds of conditions that should be considered frankly now once again I'm not here to tell you it treats or cures or prevents any of these diseases what I will tell you is that the endocannabinoid system one of the primary systems that CBD works in modulates an impacts almost every single human disease State so the doctors at the National National Institutes of Health dr. pal Packer and dr. George kunos tell us that the endocannabinoid system modulates almost every human disease state so let me ask a question from these things listed up here on the screen who who here has any one of these challenges or know somebody with one of these challenges raise your hand for me yeah every single person every single person so fundamentally comparatively to a lot of the current pharmaceuticals available for the treatment of many types of things I keep saying things because I'm being nonspecific here for the FDA is there safe right CBD is safe the terpenes are safe we're going to talk about what terpenes are a little bit what we're gonna get into here is there's a lot more going on to this whole CBD thing than than just CBD and terpenes play a big role so fundamentally these compounds are safe so today we're gonna give a primer on some basics we're gonna talk about what cannabis is what hemp is what marijuana is what they aren't we're gonna talk about CBD what it is what it isn't what we think it is but what really is going on in there when we say CBD we're gonna talk about some other cannabinoids we're going to talk about terpenes we're gonna talk about something called the entourage effect now just so I can get an idea here how many of us have heard of the entourage effect it's raise your hand good number of us we're gonna talk about how to choose a product how to use a product and we're gonna talk about some of the risks associated with the space right now so we're gonna talk about some quality control issues we're gonna talk about drug testing issues and we're talking about drug contraindication issues so let's start for with hemp and marijuana so fundamentally they're the same plan period mm-hmm you'll see these two pictures up here and one on the right or the left is hemp and the one on the right is marijuana and they look the same because they they really are the same the only difference is that THC content so the farm bill in 2018 defined this statute you know in statute and it's 0.3% THC now the way that it's the way that it's measured has a lot to do with that and there's a lot of current regulation that we're working on to standardize a lot of those procedures for the country but hemp is not marijuana marijuana's not hemp but they're both types of cannabis and hemp of course is not as not saw non psychoactive it doesn't give you that high what like marijuana does not that that high is bad or marijuana is bad it's just different one way I like to think about this is they're kind of a kinder dogs right so marijuana and hemp are - cannabis as Rottweilers and chihuahuas are - dogs there are different breeds of the same genus right and just like dogs there are a lot of different types of breeds out there so there are many many many types of breeds of hemp many types of breeds of marijuana and we're really just starting to see what's possible we're really just starting to see the tip of the iceberg out there I'm the United States is far far far ahead of many other pretty much the rest of the globe in hemp genetics and marijuana genetics and cannabis genetics and a lot of us don't know that but we are now we're behind the times on regulations Canada is ahead of us Israel's ahead of us but we're gonna catch up and we're gonna be able to take these heritage genetics from our cannabis bread baskets in this country that have preserved them through these dark ages of prohibition and bring them into the light and fully utilize them and that is what you know there so there's huge economic and therapeutic opportunity in there for the entire country and the entire globe so let's turn our attention to CBD CBD really has kind of two definitions the scientific definition is cannabidiol it is a singular molecule like this one on the screen if you're into organic chemistry but when people say CBD in the culture vernacular li they're oftentimes referring to a hemp essential oil products period and there's a lot more going on behind CBD than just CBD and we'll talk about that one of the other major components of these products are the terpenes now there are other types of cannabinoids as well so before we get into terpenes I'll just explain those a little bit so they have found almost oh well they've found over a hundred different cannabinoids in the cannabis plant better possible there's over 700 types of terpenes possible so I mean there's really a cold cornucopia of opportunity and possibility in there and and so THC is of course the other notorious Kanab cannabinoid that we know about and it works together with these terpenes and other minor cannabinoids to produce something called the entourage effect and we'll talk about that entourage effect in just a moment but it's really it's really a plant based it's a synergy it's it's it's it's one plus one equals three so terpenes you're familiar with terpenes every one here is there are every type of plant and food there the smells flavors and aromas of life and they have some profound therapeutic benefits as well as anyone here ever used aroma therapy yeah so you know that's what's working in aromatherapy are these terpenes so if you ever get the essential oils from your natural food store or doTERRA or any of that you know that is concentrated terpenes and that's a type of essential oil right so cannabinoids and turkeys are all these essential oil fractions of these plants which is where flavor the taste and really the the medicinal chemistry is live so some of the some of the more some of the common or some of the common terpenes present in cannabis that have some pretty profound effects are things like beta carrion Faline which activates your cb2 system and ISM has a very profound and an anti inflammatory response things like limonene which has a cognitive enhancing effect things like piney same thing cognitive enhancing mere scene is another really popular one where it is it's literally a muscle relaxant it helps the GABA system release the tension and the muscles and depending on how much you take can help you know act as a sedative and help you relax and get to sleep but these are these are not dangerous set it is they're not these don't cause respiratory failure or all these other really crazy things that pharmaceuticals do in fact terpenes are generally recognized as safe according to the FDA so it's these terpenes that are working with these cannabinoids to produce this entourage effect it's one plus one equals three or one plus one equals six you know it depends on the mix that you have in your batch and so there is a lot of diversity out there in these products you know they're not all just a CBD product and not all created equal and just to kind of give you some visuals on this this was a this is called a buy this this this graph right here we let me just orient it to it so on the x-axis we have the dosing the serving size I'm gonna pull this table out of the way so I can see everybody's that alright so we have on the x-axis we have these serving sizes here and on the y-axis we have health benefits and we have a bell-shaped curve here that represents your response to CBD isolate and then we have this linear curve here that's up and to the right that represents your response to a full spectrum or a broad spectrum product something that's going to producing the entourage effect that is the entourage effect right there and let me explain this this this bell-shaped curve because this is something that we're not really familiar with in our culture you know we're typically more is better basically what happens is you start taking a CBD isolate pure CBD that singular molecule we showed you earlier and up into a point you're gonna start getting a health benefit from that but the more you take the you know the worse it gets and you know basically you know you start eliminating the benefit that you're getting right so it goes it's like it's taking nothing if you take too much but if you have a good full spectrum or broad spectrum product you're gonna get this entourage effect so you're gonna get a lot further for the amount that you're taking you're gonna get a better health effect and I'm I didn't just make this up I didn't just like draw this up here because we sell full-spectrum products this has been proven out by scientists and it's been proven out in the marketplace anecdotally so this particular graph came from a study that a lady named dr. Ruth gelila did and we can share more of those types of sources later so we've been talking about full spectrum broad spectrum isolate those may be terms you understand and know about they may not be we're gonna cover those a little bit but but but first I want to talk a little bit about understanding a label because there is no standardized way to make one of these labels and there are a lot of different formats in the marketplace and it can be really confusing and so you know you may be asking yourself well how do I know if I'm gonna get you know this entourage effect from the products I'm taking and there's a lot of answers to that but the first place to start is to ask ourselves you know let's identify it is it a full spectrum broad spectrum or an isolate and what that means is full-spectrum means it has some THC in there and it has terpenes present it has the CBD and it may very well have other types of cannabinoids present so it's really it's really the whole plant being presented right so it's gonna have THC as well as these other components full-spectrum products will always lead to a stronger entourage effect however some people have THC sensitivities either because you have never been exposed to it they need to become more familiar or because you actually there is a there is a genetic component to THC sensitivity it's for a very very small part of the population but it's out there so so one of the cons to a full-spectrum product is you know the THC and the strength if you if you need to be wary of that and then of course there's the drug testing which we'll get to later a broad-spectrum product is something that has undetectable THC zero THC or undetectable THC and we'll talk about why we use the term undetectable in a little while but fundamentally it's the CBD it's the terpenes and there could also be other minor cannabinoids there and then there's the pure CBD isolate so that's like this powder right here and it's supposed to just be a pure CBD compound nothing else no terpenes no other cannabinoids there is no entourage effect with these products and of course the pro is that you can get a higher CBD concentration and the products that you're taking and if you have an issue where you're dealing with drug testing this may allow you to bypass that as well as the broad-spectrum products may allow you to bypass that so when it comes to understanding a label you can you can look at that label and sort of hopefully if the company's done its job well ascertain whether it's a full broad or isolate and the way to do that is basically so for instance on our bottles we list exactly how much CBD is in there right on the front so how many milligrams of CBD we also put how many milligrams of actual hemp extractor present so for instance in our 1000 milligram bottle there's a thousand milligrams of CBD there's one thousand four hundred and seventy-five milligrams of hemp extract so that four hundred and seventy-five milligrams is the other component that has these other terpenes and minor cannabinoids so if you see a label that has a total hip extract or has another term like cannabinoids or phyto cannabinoids and that milligram amount is higher than the CBD in the bottle then you know you likely have a full-spectrum product now we also add a THC disclaimer to our product so if you have a THC disclaimer and you have you know that total hip extract defined and your CBD milligrams defined and you can be pretty sure that you have a full-spectrum product and then of course your whoever you're purchasing this from either on the web or at a retail situation you know they will either be presenting their certificates of analysis or the staff will have already reviewed those certificates of analysis and essentially that is just that term is just a it's just a testing certificate and you can actually see the various cannabinoids that are present in these products so another and something else to call out of CBD is sometimes listed as phyto cannabidiol as well so that's kind of the first place we start when we're looking at a label and understanding what kind of product we have in our hands so fundamentally the products are diverse and each product can have its own personality can have its own affect so if you've tried one type of CBD product and it didn't work for you you may need to reconsider how you're dosing or reconsider you know consider moving to a different different type of product but don't give up on it yet so fundamentally what we really want you to take away is it's more than just CBD there's a whole mess of other things going on in there and working with a great with a great store or a good producer to help you understand what you have it should be very clear frankly so hmm now let's talk about some of these other things that ultimately influence the products personality what ends up in that bottle it's the genetics so what we start with in that seed and what its potential is is is everything that we have to work with fundamentally and of course how it's farmed has a lot to do with how it gets expressed so the same strain grown in poor conditions or in a different environment can produce a different profile different chemistry in the plant so that's important to pay attention to and then of course how it gets harvested and processed has a lot to do with it too so for instance we hand-cut everything and we hang it in a dark barn in Colorado to cure and we don't but other methods involve cutting these plants down leaving them in the field to dry where they can get weather-beaten they can develop mold like this picture here on the right and otherwise lose a lot of that content through the process you know the terpenes are very volatile the little glands on the plant will break off easily so if you're not harvesting and processing it well you can have the best genetics you can farmed it really really well but if you mishandle it it just you lose a lot of that content along the way and then of course the extraction methods are also another huge component of this there are currently three major types of extraction methods there's co2 which is what we use there's alcohol based extractions which have been an herbal standard for for many many years but they they do not produce the same quality of extract that co2 does and then there are hydro carbon extractions things that use propane butane and other sorts and those can also those can be extremely dangerous and those currently aren't legal to extract him within Colorado so with let's take a moment here and talk about the extraction a little bit so even if using a great extraction method like us like a co2 method you can still go wrong all kinds of ways along the process so fundamentally it's the heat and the temperature that you're using to do these extractions and I kind of equate it to cooking right if you boil broccoli for an hour turns into mush and it does not taste the same as if you steamed broccoli for five minutes you know the flavor profile is totally different that flavor profile are those terpenes so I mean when you cook something really heavily for a long period of time all those terpenes get destroyed by heat and they volatilize and leave and so they're not present in the mix anymore so you know how you use your co2 systems how are use any of these extraction systems along the way really influence the the taste of the product and these components that contribute to the entourage affect whether or not they're gonna be present there or not the hydrocarbons most folks don't advertise that they extract with hydrocarbons they oftentimes try to hide it and one way to look for that in a product is to look for a residual solvent analysis so you can ask whoever you're purchasing it from you know was there solvent analysis done on this product and the reason that's important is a lot of these hydrocarbons that are being used for extractions are not pharmaceutical grade they're oftentimes industrial grade they have things like toluene xylene benzene and other components in there that are frankly carcinogenic and neurotoxic so extraction is very important and then of course how it gets refined is very important so after extraction there can be a number of different things that happen to it one of the steps that typically always happens is something called decarboxylation or essentially heat activation for the cannabinoids to be in their most bioactive form they need to be heated and converted into something right so THC or CBD the plant really makes them as CBD a or THC a it's a different slightly different type of molecule and it's not as active in the body now folks do make raw formats where they don't do this but we don't because we just don't find them to be effective and but during that heating process during that decarboxylation process is another opportunity to either really get it right or get it wrong you can cook off the terpenes and then go away if you're not capturing them as well as you can start converting some of that THC into CBN CBN's another type of molecule another type of Kanab that can be quite helpful it can help people get to sleep deal with insomnia and other types of issues but if you don't want it in your mix then it can be a downside and it comes from heating and heat converting that THC so along the along the path of production there's a lot of ways to do it really well and do it really poorly and and it's another reason why there's so much diversity in the products out there there's a lot of different types of genetics every year we're gonna see more new types of genetics has anyone ever been into a marijuana dispensary before yeah so you know how many different how many different smells did you smell in there about 50 yeah so those are all the different terpenes and all the different genetic possibilities which are ultimately you know the opportunity for therapy to be more custom fitted to people along the way and then of course there's quality control so how well is the quality control being done is it being third-party tested to ensure these these these production processes are in line with where they need to be so here at Strait hemp we use essential oil cultivars as our genetics so we use terpene rich cannabinoid rich cultivars these things were bred from marijuana strains and from lineage cannabis strains I mean cannabis used to exist with CBD and THC present in them then they were bred into high THC and then they were bred back to their native format and back to high CBD strains we're breeding that THC down so rather than using a fiber or seed cultivar which are totally awesome for making fiber and seed but not great for making therapy not great for making medicinal chemistry right so our essential oil cultivars have typically anywhere between 15 and 22 percent CBD by weight comparatively to a fiber seed cultivar which has a half percent to maybe 5 percent by weight so it's pretty dramatic the difference and then the terpenes and our essential oil cultivars are 2 to 3 percent where in a fiber seed cultivar they are you know not really not measurable or up to half a percent so the the oil weights are very different and the types of oils that they're making are very different so we start with really amazing genetics and this these are the genetics that I was talking about that that this country currently has access to that we're gonna be able to continue to bring out in this nascent hemp industry and in terms of farming we grow everything like we like to say Beyond Organic we focus on building a living food web in the soil we find that building a living food web actually that microbiome helps promote the terpene production in the essential oil production we don't totally understand why but that's feeding these things compost teas really makes them sing right we water them with clean water with snowmelt we grow them out under the Sun and they produce and then in terms of harvest as I was saying we cut them down by hand and we hang them up to dry now we're working on some new top-secret extraction methods that are currently being tested this harvest we can't release yet but here in the next couple months we'll be able to talk more about that we're really excited about it so right now we're using a co2 system and we're using it in a subcritical fashion so a lot most co2 systems are run is supercritical which is not bad but it's not the best for what we want to do so we want to run we run our machines low and slow and it's more of like an artisanal batch production we're looking to capture all of that terpene out of there and as much of the CBD that we can without pulling out all the other stuff in the plant you know these plants have a lot of other fats and waxes and things that don't really contribute to the medicinal chemistry but certainly make it taste bad and and then we don't want to volatilize those terpenes that we worked so hard to grow and bring and and so we run a subcritical co2 extraction and then for refining all of our oils all of our products are heat treated or decarboxylated so they're in their most active form we do not winterize our oils that's another thing that folks do they'll freeze it and filter it and get out all these little components of the plant but we've actually found that those are are quite meted medicinal and more giving you more of that full so we keep them in there and then of course we go well we go well beyond what is currently required in terms of quality control you know we we third-party test at the time of harvest along the way we third-party test before these things go into our extraction machines after they come out and one post infusion so we're testing at multiple points along this pathway and we're doing full panels so we're testing for well just put them up here so we're testing for heavy metals we're testing for solvents we're testing for pesticides microbial contaminants cannabinoids and terpenoids are important to get tested is because hemp is a while heavy metals aren't good to have in your body and hemp is a bio remediated can be really excellent at cleaning up dirty soils but also means it can pick up a lot of stuff that's out there and get that into in the product stream so we don't we don't want that right and that's another benefit to using an essential oil cultivar like I was discussing because we get to use five to 20 times less material than folks who are using fiber seed cultivars so the less that you have to run through the last the opportunity of exposure is to various types of contaminants we test for solvents along the way to ensure we're holding all of our partners accountable and nothing is leaking into the system and we encourage anyone who's purchasing these products to look for these kinds of analyses to hold the folks you're working with accountable we test for pesticides we don't use pesticides but there's always the opportunity for drift from another farm and once again just to hold everybody accountable along the way and then microbial contaminants we're testing for things like mycotoxins as well as yeast and mold and then of course for cannabinoid content to make sure how much CBD we say is in the bottles in each drop is really there and you know this is not like this is a seriously an issue in the industry right I mean sixty-seven percent of products tested recently online that were purchased were did not have the appropriate amounts of CBD right so if you can't get the amount of CBD and your product right which is the basic thing there's all kinds of other problems I mean it really is like an iceberg like a whole issue I mean even the folks that really are supposed to know how to do this for the longest time out in California and Oregon and Colorado I can't tell you how many millions of pounds of marijuana we had to seize and stop when I was doing quality control because they were laden with pesticides you know it's a it's a cash crop fungus is liked to eat it once it gets really hefty and a lot of times people go to desperate measures to protect that crop and in fact yeah and so I mean mycotoxins is a really important one to test for because if they do get moldy like this one here it's very easy for someone to run that through an extraction system you'll never see that you know but the types of micro toxins that mold produces can be present all right so let's talk about some of the ways to to take this stuff and how to use it and so the first thing that I think is important is to set some expectations is this going to be a little bit different than traditional medicine you know then then working with a Tylenol or something take two and call me in the morning I mean it really depends on creature and conditions so who you are what's going on with you what your metabolism is and and then I'm sure as as we build more data as here we'll be able to speak to more of these over time but it's all very nascent so we're all learning together right the good news is the stuff is very safe so it's not like you're gonna overdo it and have some big problem so first of all highly diverse products as we're saying earlier so you know if you haven't found something that works for you keep looking I'd encourage you to try our products and then biofeedback and self guidance so you're gonna be paying attention to your body and what it's telling you and how this is working for you so paying attention to that and helping guide yourself and then you're gonna be need to be patient and you need to pay attention to what's happening so there are three primary delivery systems we're not going to talk about you know suppositories and eyedrops in nasal sprays today we're talking about the three major ways that you can get this and we make all three of these delivery systems so you have edible which and you have you have topical and you have inhalable now our oil you can also use sublingually and we can talk about that a little bit but let's talk with edible so the edible format is the longest lasting so four to eight hours of duration and it comes on in about 30 to 45 minutes so it's also the longest onset it's really great for treating you know persistent chronic issues it's not great for acute relief when you need something right now so it's best for planned relief and then our the topicals are kind of in between and inhalable and inedible in terms of onset and duration so they're kind of medium lasting three to six hours and the onset can be anywhere from 10 to 25 30 minutes and then with an inhalable or vapes as I'm sure you've heard them called it's immediate I mean we're talking within seconds so you can see effect and I know that you may have seen some headlines recently about this whole vape crisis and vape illness and we can talk a little bit about that today as well and I can explain to you why we have stuck to our guns and and made of a product so the vape products the inhalable formats like I said are the they come on the fastest and they also last the shortest amount of time so something to consider with the edibles is because they have a long onset time it's really important to be patient and not just start taking more of them if it hasn't done anything for you in 10 minutes or 20 minutes because that is a good way to UM take a little bit too much and so the best thing to do if you're not familiar with this stuff is is is take it and wait an hour see what happens you know start at some of these lower dosages and we'll go over some dosages here to start and and wait so that's kind of important caution with edibles another thing to note that I don't have up here is some studies are showing that if you take these products with food particularly fatty food it increases the absorption rate can make them up to five times more potent so if you just happen to eat you know you know some I don't know scrambled scrambled eggs and cheese or something and then you just ate some you took your CBD it could have a different effect on you and that's likely because it's helping deliver it to that upper small intestine area and helping it get past the the stomach so the topical when taking when using are topical it's important to not rub it off your skin or speech sweaty and those types of things if it if it loses contact your skin will affect the transmission it's it's really awesome for treating tissue issues and specific areas so for instance I was playing jiu-jitsu a few weeks ago and I about ripped my finger off and had swollen up you know and I was able to put the topical right on there and within minutes I was seeing reduced inflammation and pain but at the same time it's systemic gets into your bloodstream and goes everywhere so I've had folks that have used it to treat mood disorders and other types of things as well and then of course the inhalable and we can kind of pause here for a minute and just talk about our product for a moment so we were really we were really particular about the kind of vape that we made and we really we got a lot of pushback for even doing this initially because it was hard to do the CBD likes to gel up and crystallize and not work in this hardware and that's why people cut it with vitamin E and propylene glycol and all that other weird stuff you've been reading about because it makes it actually work in these systems we have avoided that issue completely by using our own terpenes from our hemp plants as the carrier as the thinning agent so it's just hemp essential oil in there there's nothing else present additionally the type of hardware we're using is premium we didn't cut any corners here it's it's it's glass it's metal and the and the battery is premium it always produces the same voltage consistently allowing you to get us the same type of temperature that's all important oh and also the coil inside is ceramic so these are all and this is all very important because many of the hardware components in the vape world such as the coils are made of metal which degrade and leach various alloys into the mix which then get airlines and breed though in the the plastics are not generally non-fda-approved plastics they can have things like phalates in there which are endocrine disrupters and then of course the heating is very important because overheating these these these products can cause all sorts of weird heat byproducts to be formed and it's essentially like inhaling a chemistry experiment so we wanted to create a product that was pure this is basically concentrated aromatherapy right so you're just inhaling an essential oil in this case the hemp essential oil and we just absolutely had to make this and we decided not to pull it down during this vape crisis thing because this is the kind of product people should be using as opposed to these these other toxic products that are hurting them you know and if we don't provide them with a legal accessible option they're just going to turn to the black market and it's going to continue to create these problems that we're seeing right now so rather than hide in the dark and create more of a public health crisis we've decided to hold hold our ground on this and yeah so that's what I have to say about waves and in terms of suggested serving guidelines here are some numbers right here the way this works is you just take your weight your pounds multiply it by the milligrams and that'll get you an idea on how much you should start with and you can take that 1 to 3 times daily and we advise starting low and going slow and last year into extreme sports like I am if you're into extreme sports then you can try taking a heavier dose and seeing how it does you and determining whether or not you need to back off or go up I would encourage you though if it's something that you're trying for the first time to do it when you don't have an engagement to go to so that you can feel calm and study how it's going to work with you so let's stop here does anybody have any questions over some of the things we've been going over yes sir yes yeah so let's okay so you just brought up the sublingual application and I didn't have a slide up here for that but let's talk about that so sub sublingual is more like inhaling in the sense that you get a much faster absorption rate and it's more bioavailable so it can be very effective to sort of get more mileage out of out of your products the one downside to sublingual well it could be two downsides I mean if you don't like the taste that can be a downside but the other potential downside is you can't you don't get it quite the standardized dosing oh we didn't get him to say it on the mic huh do we need to go back over it yes so the gentleman was asking us if you know are we supposed to take this with food to increase the absorption rate and how does that impact whether or not we should take it sublingually is that what you're asking okay yeah so so so the sublingual application can be a very good one to get more mileage out of your products but it it's harder to get standardized dosing that way because it's you know you have saliva production you're gonna swallow some of that so if you're taking a larger dose sometimes it's hard to determine how much like ends up in your stomach and how much stays in your mouth so that would kind of be the only downside I think to sublingual but in terms of how that relates to taking it with a food if you're finding good application now with a sublingual a method and you had kind of have it dialed in I wouldn't encourage you to change that and you can experiment with eating it with a meal and seeing if you get a better effect that way does that answer your question okay any other questions yes ma'am oh yeah wait we're gonna give you the mic so everybody can hear and everyone can hear your question I wonder if one takes their dose when they're with food I think I was I was thinking that it would dilute the absorption because it would have to deal with all the stomach acids and the food and all the things that are happening in the gut which is why I really don't recommend capsules I'm wrong well right so it's interesting you know because different capsules are made or made differently and depending on the type of food that someone's taking that can that's going to influence how it's getting absorbed as well so it's probably best for folks to if they want to really standardize the dosages that they're taking to take it on an empty stomach or certain time after eating food right so they're not getting any kind of food interference because the kind of food that you're eating and what you're taking those are all things that can influence the overall effect of the product right so you might get a more profound effect but you may not yeah so it's going to depend on the types of foods that you're taking yeah does that answer your question ok any other questions okay yes ma'am so on the subcritical extraction do you reintroduce terpenes at all or is everything that's present leftover from that process yeah so we do so we do not take we do not use any other plant derived terpenes and are these formulations we use except for the bomb our bomb has a number of other other plant allies in there with it but we use our terpenes that come come with it so we capture terpenes when we decarboxylate so we have a big reconned entry condensation tube that captures all that vapour weari condense and we fold that back in with the co2 systems we just run them at a certain temperature to not drive them off essentially and work to capture as much as we can but we don't have a system to recapture them on the co2 system yeah does any answer your question yes mm-hmm yeah and the vape goes through another process it's called fractional distillation so there's another refinement step because we have to essentially pull the THC out of there because once it gets concentrated you know it has a higher THC percentage that we want to pull that back and through that process there's another condensing component that's capturing off gas yep any other questions currently okay keep going so some of the side effects and now these side effects are reported by the Mayo Clinic they're in the epidemic safety trials up dialects was that pure CBD compound that GW made mmm it's possible with other products but we see these happen a lot with CBD isolates and high concentrations of CBD isolates so with a full-spectrum product like ours you're not going to have to take a whole lot of it to get the effect that you need but things that could happen are dry mouth diarrhea reduced appetite drowsiness and fatigue it's possible however CBD in is not really a it's not a sedative and once again these reported with CBD isolates primarily and then there are some contraindications to pay attention to so there are folks running around like you know saying this is a panacea and you should take as much of it as you can and we generally happen to agree but fundamentally if you're taking a medication where there's a warning about grapefruit it should be a point of concern you should just talk to your physician about that it's not a show stopper there haven't been any major adverse effects reported from this but basically what happens is the way grapefruit interferes with certain medications CBD does a very similar thing and that can lead to elevated levels of certain drugs that one is taking in in the bloodstream so for instance this has been demonstrated clinically with various blood thinners and anti-epileptics so there's a lot of products that you can get in your natural food store and that have you know other contraindications Saint John's wort is a good example of that natural herb that has some interference with SSRIs and other antidepressants so fundamentally if they're you're taking a medication that has a grapefruit warning on there have another conversation with your physician and if you need more information product there's a website project CBD org and we can provide that later they have a whole primer on there that you can get and take to your physician to help facilitate a dialogue around that if you're unsure and then there's drug testing so this is another big one all of our products you will fail a drug test if you take them they all have THC now that doesn't if that's a concern for you but there's an opportunity to possibly negotiate with your employer on that we'd be willing to support that we have successfully got help we've helped folks get approved at their doctor's offices at like pain clinics and things and in employment board situations if you know basically help make the case that they're taking a hemp product and not a marijuana product and they'll allow that that THC I mean that's not standard yet but it is something we're seeing happen out there and then of course there are products that are THC free but I want to give you some words of caution around those okay so hmm the way that they measure the THC it doesn't really allow them to tell you that there's zero there it tells you that there's none they're up to a certain point because below that they can't measure it right now THC is a bio accumulator it likes to build up in your body sticks to fat and a lot like I kind of liken it to a peanut allergy so you can make a food in a facility that handles peanuts and not have any peanuts in the ingredients of your products but but still have an allergic reaction to that product and that's because they're sort of a peanut residue present right so there can be sort of a THC residue present in THC free products that isn't really accounted for that depending on how much you take what your metabolism is and how sensitive the drug test is you know can all lead to a situation where you thought you were taking it to each see for your product and now you fail a drug test right and then there's also another side of this with some drug testing methods that are somewhat really outdated but they use an acid in the process right and certain acids have been shown to turn CBD into THC so the metabolites in your urine or wherever they're doing this can they can actually turn them into what they're looking for right and that's a whole other side of this and we've seen a case like that in Colorado with a friend who recently had to go to a court over for custody over his child who was taking CBD and they drug tested it and turned it into THC now he won the case but it's something to be aware of that's out there so drug testing is still still a thing and and and and we really don't see another way out of this until one of two things happens either a company produces some clinically validated results that you know you will in fact not fail a drug test but fun or fundamentally we change the laws and I recommend that we change the laws and Nevada recently passed the law that no discrimination for drug testing and we can do the same right here and everywhere else so that's mostly the bulk of the material I'd love to talk with you all some more though you know what are you what kind of questions do we have about the space yes ma'am oh that's right I keep forgetting to do that I wanted some clarification about the fact that there's THC or no THC in the vape pen in the cartridge yeah so our vape pen does have THC in it it's Delta eight THC it's not Delta nine so it's a little less psychoactive and of course with with the CBD load in there it's it doesn't really have that psychoactive profile but it is a full-spectrum product there is THC present yep yep but it's still under that point three percent threshold any other questions yes sir so that I get the hemp part but then you see sometimes that's him and then it says CBD and then something say hemp but doesn't say CBD at all and it's just very confusing like is everything with hemp have CBD automatically and what's is there any difference between them and then you got the milligrams like one's a three thousand and one says 25 I think that's about the dropper but those two questions kind of about the difference between CBD in them and then the milligrams and how that ties in sure yeah so back up a little bit so you were asking you know you see on the labels hemp CBD how do you know the difference and then how do you determine the milligrams that are there yeah so I can tell you for for our products we tell you exactly how much TV is present right on the bottle and in the supplemental facts panel will list how much CBD is present and then we also have another mark on there that's four total hemp extract for that hemp extract component and so if you see CBD it should be referring to the actual amount of cannabidiol present and then the hemp extract should refer to you know the CBD plus all the other components so plus all the other terpenes and cannabinoids in other parts of the hemp extract now that can be that can you know that what that other hemp extract is can really very very can vary greatly for all those reasons that we were discussing so it's hard for us to really say ubiquitously in the industry you know it is x y&z but this the CBD so for instance we have in our one ounce bottle a thousand milligrams of CBD we have a thousand four hundred and seventy-five let's say 1500 we have 1500 milligrams of total hemp extract so I tracked the CBD content from that and that tells me I have 500 milligrams of other hemp extract components in addition to the CBD right and then on our products we tell you very clearly how much CBD per drop is actually present so we sort of dial it in per serving size for you and let you know general but like you know there's so many products out there and so many brands and so many labels and formulas that there is a lot of loose loosey goosy stuff out there you know so if it's if it's not clearly if it's not very clear about what's there and you can't tell you might want to move to a different product fundamentally because that lack of transparency has got to be indicative of other things as well so it should fundamentally tell you how much CBD is there tell you how much impacts tracked the difference between the two is are these other components that help drive the entourage effect and then it should tell you very clearly how much per serving size is there now some companies weren't putting the CBD on there because they were scared of legal actions so they were only doing the hemp extract and they'll just have him extract and you know how much him extract per serving they and and they they may have CBD present or they may not or it may not be you know who knows what it is frankly you know so if they're not gonna have it on the bottle they should at least have it on the website for review easily for you to tell you know but if none of that stuff is present and they're not being transparent about it I think it's a reason you know it's probably a reason to keep going does that help answer your question okay yes ma'am oh hang on let's give you the mic keep forgetting to do that we're just gonna have you sit up front Bonnie so there's not like a like on silver there's a mark that says that it's sterling silver or whatever right not anything like that for these products and it's really on the consumer to determine yes and no so for the first part you know there there isn't a mark per se like silver where the industry the total industry has accepted it right there are certifying bodies so there are certifications that you can look for as a consumer and then I'll say it's up to the consumer to really sort this out until the regulator's get there but also the retailers that are currently carrying these products you know they have a good reputation then they have that reputation uphold and they have done a lot of work already to vet great companies so you know going to a trusted retail partner that's in you know in the natural space and working to you know help you understand and kind of get to that knowledgeable place faster so it's not necessarily totally up to you if you have somebody you can trust that's been out there researching that sort of thing but other ways like marks to pay attention to of course or how the labels are laid out so if they're laid out in a way that's very clear like we were just discussing that's a clear and that's an indicator that's kind of a mark to pay attention to and then of course there are these um there are these uh well skip the COA so basically there's a US hemp Authority which we are currently under process for getting that certification that's sort of a stamp that's out there that helps separate the wheat from the shaft so to speak you know are they pulling are they getting their material from a licensed hemp cultivation where's it coming from it should come from someplace that has a state license or USDA license so that should be present also there should be state health licensing along the way so we have a Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment license for wholesale food manufacturing so um we also have another one from the Denver Public Health so they're these public health certificates you can look for as well so but until the FDA rolls out regulation or on a state-by-state level that that happens you know we're not really going to see a mark like that yeah does that help answer your question and sort of get us at some ways we can help find good products yeah there's a lot out there there's a ton to sort through I'm sorry but I love you so much and I love that product so much so I just want to say to people that are here if you not if you have any question buy straight hemp there you go yeah if you have any questions buy our products yeah don't even look at the other ones I mean there's one or two that I would also recommend but straight amp is the best we did not plant her I've never met her before but that's awesome thank you for sharing that so I'm not sure in regards to your labor alone I can't remember exactly but what significance if any does aerial parts play you see that yeah that is a so that is a artifact of old legislation so in 2014 the farm bill stated you know the languages was kind of obscure and one could interpret it to mean all aerial parts of the plant you know so we're sort of like you can't just take the little buds off you got to take the whole kind of plant and so mmm it was more of a legal shield so that if you know the feds came in prior to 2018 farm bill and we're like you know we're gonna shut you down you got marijuana over there boy and we're coming to get you we could be like no actually we're using the aerial parts we're following you to the letter of the law so that's really what that's about and if I you know the aerial parts here in this picture is literally everything above the ground so you know from right there up that's what it's referring to does that answer your question yep we'll get you the mic here that raises another question what part of the plant do you use yeah great so actually so we use the aerial parts except we strip it down from the center stem so basically what we do is we we cut these things then we hang them up and then we come in and we shuck them essentially we shuck them down and we take those axial branches all those you know all the other branches and we send them off and they get ground up and then that pulp goes into the extraction machines so the you know the flower or the Leafs the stem all that tissue is all present you know okay well what I really want asked you was have you seen any results from people using maybe the straight CBD oil the skin and I'm thinking maybe skin cancer and stuff like that yeah so I can't I can't speak to whether or not it'll help with skin cancer but what I can say is we've seen a lot of interesting things happen with the skin with folks and you know our topical product the bomb is really designed for the skin but but uh but then if you don't want something that strong or you know him seed oil itself actually has some really amazing properties for the skin we've seen we've seen some major skin issues cleared up with application of just hemp seed oil and and nothing else and but you know we had a we had a lady a few weeks ago that came to visit us at a talk and she had showed us a picture and she was just I mean from the face down red and leaky like Ozzie and puffy and she was in a lot of pain and she you know rubbed the grub the balm all over her skin like a spider bite or something yep recluse or something she showed us picture she looked like something like an alien like seriously her face was crazy yep and so it it's worth a try you know I would say definitely try it out I mean in terms of dealing with inflammation and and other other you know skin challenges there are components in that balm that are meant to help penetrate the skin help bring that healing you know property into the skin yeah I'm hesitant to go too much deeper because I don't want the FDA to come after me she was using the bomb yeah she was using the bomb so you can use the you can use the the full-spectrum oil it just doesn't not have the same penetrating power so that oils thinner and it kind of comes off and it's so it's just not designed to like get into the skin quite like the balm is of the bombs gonna go a lot further yeah so the THC is what gives it the I don't want to say hallucinogenic but that's the stronger effect is that correct I wouldn't say stronger but I would say that it is the component that gives you that I can give it the intoxicating effect so so you know that you know when you get hot if you get high or something or you get stoned or you know you have you get intoxicated from cannabis it's really being driven by that THC component right so it has the strongest psychoactivity right but it also has some very incredible medicinal and healing properties and so I'm not here to throw THC under the bus by any means and it THC in small quantities really supports CBDs effectiveness in the body does that any three that's the first part so that being said is your product since it contains that the full spectrum is it can you sell that in any state yes that's right because THC up to 0.3% is now legal it is federally illegal yeah now anything above that is not and we have to be really careful about that because it's really hard to grow hemp under 0.3% I mean and those laws will likely change over time and you recommend the best type of oil is the one that does contain some portion of THC yes definitely that's why we sell the full spectrum because we find that that has the greatest efficacy now I will tell you the only two places we don't sell it or Idaho and South Dakota because they're still arresting people there they haven't figured it out you know no up here get running around with a mic in a drug test for instance yes okay so how long will that point three percent THC remain in your drug I mean in your blood system to show up on a drug test I can't tell you that I mean I could tell you like back in college when I needed to like get a job you know I typically like wait two weeks or you know yeah so you think something as small as what this is would also probably take two weeks that's right and depending on what your metabolism is like and also what kind of drug tests they're giving you so it's really hard for me to tell I can't tell you how to use it safely and pass a drug test you know I really can't do that and I'm not going to because I think that would be leading you astray I think you know either let's get you know get it let's get a different job or you know we will happily get on the phone with your employer or write a letter and you know try to help overcome those kinds of obstacles yeah yes I have a question does Delta eight THC show up in a drug screen it's a good question yes it does yeah thanks if it really is the wild wild west we've got our our health centered store were approached weekly with folks that have bought some isolate in their making up a batch of Lord knows what putting a label on it can you speak to the more formal lobbying that's going on [Music] yeah definitely so currently the the two main regulatory bodies that are weighing in on this at the federal level are the USDA and the FDA now the USDA is like Pro hemp all-day rah-rah-rah I got to meet their marketing service which is actually who the folks who brought you got milk and beef it's what's for dinner and they're like preparing to launch those kinds of campaigns for him which is totally awesome and and they basically stepped in and the general counsel to USDA recently released his opinion statement which is hey guys hemp is legal don't get in the way of interstate commerce you can Rhett you know so at the state level it's possible for the state to create regulations that prohibit the production and distribution of hemp internally but they cannot prohibit the interstate commerce right so that's what the USDA is saying and then the USDA is currently working on you know all the rules that we need like how do we sample these plants do we take the top part to take the whole thing you know what is 0.3% mean and what are the what are the growing standards what kind of pesticides can use all that kind of SEP so all that's being worked out at the USDA and they are huge fans of hemp now the FDA is a whole nother can of worms I don't envy the FDA's position because they are sort of caught in a rock in a hard place they have you know the political will is stating that this is a thing and it's gonna keep going that way but they are like statutorily buy bound right now to to follow their their letter of the law so they'd have to make they're gonna have to either make a special exception or Congress is gonna have to pass a law specifically to like how allow them to have a special exception so there's just basically sitting on the sidelines and they're asking that we meet threshold FDA threshold requirements right now so for instance for us that is you know an FDA registered facility making sure we're doing an adverse event reporting working towards our cgmp standards mmm so that's what the FDA is looking for in a threshold basis and they're fundamentally just collecting as much data right now from everyone that they can they're trying to figure out how much is okay how much is safe really you know if this stuff is in everything if it's in our food and our water and you know all of a sudden everywhere what does that mean you know versus just taking it as a supplement should we have maximum dosages and concentrations and bottles or not mm-hmm and then of course they're trying to balance all of that with the fact that you know there is a pharmaceutical company that has achieved this drug patent on HEPA dialects and CBD and of course currently GW is position the pharmaceutical companies position is they want everyone to have their own swimlane they want to have the pharmacy channel and have insurance paying for things and doing it that way and they also want to support that you know the natural product space as well and mmm currently some of the best organizations to be part of are the ones that we are the USM roundtable is doing a lot of incredible work to move the industry forward and and and help on a state-by-state level as well and then there's vote hemp and there's the hemp industries association those are all organizations that we think are doing a lot and then of course there's there's just state-level stuff right so for instance I think here in North Carolina y'all are working on a smokeable hemp law currently and an evaluating kind of how some of this rolls out and I can't necessarily speak to the state-by-state level issues at this current time but if you're interested I can certainly send you some information on that and you know they're pushing the FDA hard because essentially until they roll out regulation we're all sort of left guessing on we're left with me having to explain all of these details to everybody when you know they can just we can get regulation passed with them and get that stamp that we need and sort of establish you know the line in the sand on what's good and what isn't and in terms of you know basically what we're looking at doing is translating the quality control from the camp the cannabis experiences in Colorado and Washington and Oregon to experience because the regulations already all there and frankly the FDA you know sort of just needs to look up from their shoelaces and see you know the safety of this plant for what it is I mean if we were gonna have any major adverse events we would have seen tons of them by now and you know it's gonna possibly you know there might be a hold another opportunity to create a whole new standard of medicine and pharmacy out of this at this point and you know pH a are in you know farming because there's so many botanical solutions out there and hemp can help us pave away with the FDA to establish like a whole new way to develop things that's sort of a blend between you know drug development and over-the-counter natural products which it currently doesn't and they're open to this sort of thing we we were able to speak with them at a recent Congress up in Colorado so there's a lot going on and we we fundamentally believe it's going to come out that all parties and players can continue to move forward and that we are going to get the regulation in place that we need does that answer your question great so speaking of advocacy do we have any champions up on the hill are you guys as a hemp growing coalition cultivating someone to speak for us because we've got to come up with some advocacy also yeah so love him or hate him Mitch McConnell has been one of the best advocates for the hemp industry coming out of Kentucky yeah and and so basically they have a bill that we have worked on writing and I say we I mean the hemp industry that we're working to get past I would essentially create this space for the FDA to do its job and permanently remove that roadblock so and then you have organizations like Appa that's another one the American Herbal Products Association and they're all over there doing an incredible job of you know essentially moving the needle in all these regulations so those are all good organizations to support thank you any other questions like how many plants does it take to make like that 4000 milligram bottle just yeah price point you know because it's on the pricey side just curious as to how many plants go into that size bottle gotcha so so well it's not a whole plant it's a piece of a plant to make that and it depends on how many you know it depends on how much weight you know how much how many pounds of essential oil you have on that plant but what it sounds like is what we really want to talk about is pricing right gotcha I don't know I've never been asked that question before you have stumped me I'd have to do a little back of the envelope math yeah yeah but I mean I don't know if I had to look at this I'd say like you know like the top part of that plant right there the cola you know on top about that big yeah I think eventually we'll be able to bring prices down but right now you know there's a lot of things to pay for we got to pay for lobbyists we have to fight the government we have to you know and continue to improve quality and fundamentally we would like there to be more access and once there is more supply and we have you know the whole thing stood up we'll be able to achieve greater economies of scale yeah and then hopefully you know what we'll be able to see is sort of an over-the-counter approach you know over-the-counter medicine approach and and be able to get the price down yeah do we grow our own or do we get it from somewhere else yeah so we currently get it from our friends in Colorado these are farmers that we've known for the last five years up there I used to farm this myself I farmed it in 20 2006 and 2007 and I did okay you know we were making okay plants but I fundamentally wasn't the best farmer I had it was better at a lot of other things so you know what we're good at doing at this point is going into our farming partners and assessing their supply quality and ensuring it is what we want it to be and sort of directing the development of those varietals to produce the kinds of plants we want to see in the marketplace fundamentally one way to bring the cost down is to partner with others in the economy that are doing it right and bring them to the table so we can all provide you know those pieces along the value chain to really produce the best the best possible product so for instance our farm currently the main farm right now is in place called Rocky Ford Colorado a group called the Kiehl's are farming it and we also primarily pull with pulls from some farms in Oregon we're evaluating some farms in Kentucky you know we would be open to farms in the Carolinas we think fundamentally it's it's very important to have farms in different places because any year you farm you know you stand a 20% chance of total crop loss right so it's important to have a diverse diverse mix so we're gonna take a break for a moment to do a raffle okay and then we want to move into testimonials and then we'll do some more questions Thanks okay all right thanks everyone get out your ticket okay I'm gonna read the last three numbers it's zero seven six zero seven six Oh Renee in the back all right okay this one's actually zero six seven I'm just this yeah that was zero seven six this one's zero six seven zero six seven going once going twice that's yours all right zero five zero whoo all right thank you so something really interesting happened last night when we were talking down at Greenville people just started up standing up and telling their stories about their interaction with these products so it's something that really gives us a lot of energy to keep doing this work and if anyone here does anybody here want to share how CBD has impacted their life you'll you will all right you'll start us off well CBD has impacted my life and my work life because I work in a natural health food store and learning about this and helping people has meant so much to me it is incredible to have a person who can't stand up straight leaning on their shopping cart come over to me and ask me a few questions about CBD of course straight hemp is one you know my first suggestion and then have them come back a month later to get another bottle and say and they're standing up and they're not leaning on their cart it's just amazing the testimonials that people have given me in the store it brings tears to my eyes it's wonderful to be able to help people this way and me personally unbelievable I mean just paint aches and pains that I always had where I'm sure we're from inflammation that they have gone down can walk I can lift I can I can sit here with my neck up and not worry that it's going to be killing me it's just I just love it and I love the heart and I love the the want to heal people that that straight him reflects thank you ma'am anybody else have any great experience this doesn't have to be with our products either just in general we'd love to know what's happening out there I'll make this pretty quick so for 20 years I was a heroin addict and I've been sober for almost six years but luckily but I wish this product would have been around a lot sooner you know it probably could have saved me a lot of a lot of heartache it's just one of you know one of the many tools I have now along with like a 12-step program addiction psychiatrist therapist all of that but it's amazing you know the before like the things anxiety and insomnia unfortunately the only things that work I can't take because I'll take them all you know so this is definitely something and it doesn't even you know I talk a lot about it with my psychiatrist it's not like I'm gonna sit there and drink the whole bottle you know it's not even it's it's completely different but you know and then you know to not only be able to share that with people who are struggling with addiction and I mean addiction it were alcoholism I mean that who's not affected by that in some way shape or form today so especially now working at a restaurant and you know just being on my feet completely all day you know it's just it's been nothing short of a miracle it hasn't and this is the brand that I do keep coming back to I mean I've tried probably 40 50 I mean but you know you always trying to find you always come back to that between me him and the dog everybody's on it so yeah it's just a good product it's it's a great product it is literally I mean I know thank you for being open about that yeah I'm sharing that anyone else want to share it's just more specifically about the product in general last year my uncle was diagnosed with a stage four glioblastoma and if you know what that is it's a terrible brain tumor and it disabilities your life very suddenly and you know doctors they try to narrow in on the medications and this that and the other and you know these doctors have trained for years and they can't get it right King in the medication right so we turned to CBD you know is very natural praying transgression to everything else with it going on in the media and the thing that I thought was the worst part about it was he couldn't figure out what to use you know there's the gas stations selling it like every multi lead media marketing company is selling it you know so like what's what and at the end of the day we couldn't even get his his doctors to get on board with a brand and tell us what would be reputable and what to use so one of the things that I found to be great about straight hemp was the transparency on the bottle and how easy it was to read and it was straightforward and like you said if it's all there then that those are the questions that you need answered so I just wanted to say that I I really appreciate that about the company and the brand as a whole thank you skin issues ends anxiety and I will just reiterate I tell folks we carry straight hemp and that's it and if there's a better way to create a CVD product I trust straight hem to it yeah we're on it we're on it pushing the envelope right now thank you my mom passed away last fall but I want to take the story back to November 2015 when she went to the hospital because she couldn't breathe they thought she had pneumonia but they never could clear it up so then they finally then anymore I found out she had a huge cancerous in her left lung it was actually bigger than my fist and so that was in November nobody thought she was going to leave the hospital we didn't think she'd lived to see Christmas they actually called the hospice into the hospital to get that all set up well I want a health food store so I started her own CBD right away and she actually lived three years longer than we expected her to live and I think most that was CBD and I think she might used to be alive today but I went over to her house shortly before she passed away and I saw a half a bottle of CBD which should have been gone months ago and she had just quit taking it and so I thought I think she was just ready to go at that time yeah thank you for sharing that sorry for your loss well how about that it's really it's helping people you know that's why I came out here today is to get in touch with you all and and and just see you know what's happening out there and you know we'll share this information that we've talked about here tonight you know you can find it on our YouTube channel and we'll send this out via email as well and we're gonna continue to work to make the best possible products for y'all and and keep pushing it forward I have one quick share um this past weekend I was with a friend who's a chiropractor and I really like to learn more about your company and he said cuz they see he sees my Facebook post he says sounds really like it's really high-quality so I told a little bit about it goes Bonnie God you know he's a chiropractor and he's my right hand has been bothering me so much I could hardly practice I'm getting numbing and my fingers he says really it's been debilitating for me I've been trying all different product lines different CBD products so I had some of the SAP in my purse I said well here let me give this to you and why don't you rub some in your hand right now I've I've heard incredible things about the SAP I mean I've had people who have neck issues headaches I've been at the trade show at Expo East I had friends using it they're like 20 minutes late they're like it's gone so I said here try this and then we were just talking and hanging out with different people and then 20 minutes later he came over me because Bonnie the pain is gone and the numbness is gone from my hand for the first time in like months he was blown away he wants to carry it in his practice that's amazing and I was just hanging out with him I wasn't even like looking to make a sale I'm just so I love I love these kind of shares you know that I hear in my work with the companies so thanks Bonnie and who was it over here we weren't we hadn't tried CBD yet you what do you are we feeling about it now are you more open to it I don't want to put you on the spot but I am oh really okay uh-huh okay both you all have that issue got it that makes that makes sense we're happy really and that isn't that just crazy that they can load you up on opiates and all this other very bad dope but you can't have a plant so that's gonna change eventually if I mean if you want to just contact us after this well you know if you want us to help write letters or anything like that happy to do that you know thank you yeah that was a real bear to get done honestly yeah well thanks for coming out tonight y'all if you don't have any other questions or anything we can kind of break up yeah yeah so we've been selling the straight hemp product family since 2017 August 2017 I have been involved in the cannabis industry in a you know badged and professional way since 2014 and we have we started farming hemp in 2016 so so we've been in space now for about I don't know I can do math right now but about five years personally and then our team in general has over 50 years of experience in cannabis so we have a lot of you know deep experience in that space mm-hmm any other questions how was this it was this helpful tonight awesome well thanks for coming out [Applause]", "wMWVmIfj_n4": "this is a review of charlotte's web full spectrum hemp extract cream their 750 milligram formula i've tested uh quite a few of their products in the past they usually have a bit extra i sent this one to two labs and it had a lot extra which is surprising for the biggest name in the hemp game we're gonna go over those lab tests the price breakdown the strength and what i think about charlotte's web full spectrum hemp extract cream right now my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow a beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy all right for forty dollars charlotte's web claims you get 750 milligrams of total cannabinoids they don't actually say the cbd quantity in this product which is a little complaint i have i do use affiliate links to help support these free lab tests i pay for the lab test i pay for the product and as you will see i cannot control what the labs say both labs gave it f scores fifty percent fifty point nine six percent more forty eight point four two five percent more the uh official lab tests are here and they claim 750 total milligrams we found over 1100 let's break it on down okay and they have over 1100 milligrams of cannabinoids and over 1000 milligrams of cbd this is a good full spectrum extract it just has a lot more let's see the uh the price break down here okay 3.8 cents per milligram of cbd that is very good but remember this is based on the lab results you're actually looking at according to their claims around five cents or more but the average topical goes for about 17 cents the oils the average full spectrum oil the kind you put in your mouth goes for around 10 cents so a premium brand according to lab results going for under 4 cents per milligram of cbd is great okay you got a bunch of natural ingredients in here some organic ingredients you got rosemary i do smell that a little bit i definitely smell the ginger and i definitely smell the hemp in this product one of the downsides to having a natural hemp product like this with all the terpenes those terpenes are thought to have some medicinal benefits they're basically like essential oils the problem with having a lot of terpenes in the natural ingredients is you smell the hemp the hemp smell comes from the terpenes which is earthy and pungent and potent it does not smell good and this product doesn't really smell good i would say it smells about average for a strong full spectrum extract so you definitely have to want a natural product like this and want all those extra terpenes now the uh the look of the cream it it does not look good it's a brown um and it has that that strong smell the hemp smell goes away no it doesn't go away it goes starts to go away and smell just like something floral after about five minutes but even even if you have it on for an hour you still smell something like a flower not necessarily hemp but you you still you still smell the hemp it's still there and the uh the oil once you put it on there's a little bit of a brown tint to your skin and that that goes away after about five minutes but i wouldn't say it's sticky after five minutes even after an hour it there's still a film uh feel to it i put some on my legs this morning that was hours ago and i still i still feel it on my legs a little bit it's not sticky it's just i know it's there um it doesn't feel great now the bottle itself looks really nice it's uh which is typical of charlotte's web i mean it's a premium brand it has a nice matte finish and then the text is raised with uh it's got a shiny text and you got foil on the front it's it's a nice bottle you got the us hemp authority certified on the back it's nice and moving down to their gram breakdown on about 14.5 milligrams of cbd per gram a gram is about a milliliter you can apply it over an entire body part it ends up being quite a bit and this is a good full spectrum a lot of the full spectrums that i test are three milligrams five milligrams of cbd so 15 milligrams is higher i've seen them go up as high as what our re botanicals had like 50 milligrams very potent little guy a lot of the ones i like are over 10 milligrams but with the cbd and cannabinoids you really have to try them out and look at the cannabinoids and ingredients because all of these creams are going to affect everyone individually and differently because your absorption rate your endocannabinoid system everyone has a different um experience and it would be misleading for me to give you my experience because it's going to be different from yours the thc that's a decent amount of tac it won't enter the bloodstream but might relax your your skin a bit the 0.45 milligrams or more almost 0.5 milligrams of cbc that is a decent amount this is a well-rounded full-spectrum extract you got some trace levels of other cannabinoids this is really good even though it has a bunch more cbd and cannabinoids in it than you expected okay so there's a bunch of stuff i don't really like it came with way too many cannabinoids uh they don't even specify the cbd levels in it uh the the brown look the the texture that stays on there the smell that kind of lingers none of that's great but if you're looking for a quality really good full spectrum extract with a lot of different cannabinoids from a brand like charlotte's web that's pushed the cbd industry forward this is a good option i can't recommend it because it doesn't have accurate lab reports but it's a good product and you you have to be okay with the hemp smell and the naturals the natural terpenes in this but a lot of people are looking for a natural hemp product with the full entourage effect with all these cannabinoids and this would be a good product for them i will see you next time you wonderful person you", "3qY5KHkuH7w": "The use of CBD oil is becoming one of\nthe hottest trends in the health and wellness community, for good cause. It has\na growing number of scientific articles that have been published on its\npotential health benefits as well as a growing number of anecdotal reports from\nboth clients and doctors alike on its potential health benefits for pain, for\nmood, for sleep and today I'm with someone that has some experience with\nCBD oil. I'm Dr. Ryan Shelton and I'm really honored today to be with Angela\nDavis. Angela is a registered nurse and she is also a representative for a\ncompany that manufactures and sells CBD oil. So Angela thank you so much for your\ntime today.  I'm treasured to be with you, just a few quick questions for the audience, again I value your time and I value their time as well, do you\nhave any personal use with CBD oil. Yes for sure.\nI started maybe about a month ago started using it myself\nthere's multitude of different options you have out there for trying it but I\nhave been able to find some good relief with anxiety and to help with regulating\na sleep pattern for my life. I feel pretty good with what I've been using so\nfar there's a lot more interest in a lot of different types out there that I want\nto investigate using between THC and THC free type of products so yeah I'm really\ngood with it so far. And the forms that you use are they\noral drops are they topical creams? They are two different forms so far the\ncompany I found and I've invested time in and interested in is has two\ndifferent forms right now and one is it tincture that dissolves underneath\nyour tongue, okay and one is a topical cream. Okay now I\nknow from my own research that there are quite a few companies that market CBD\noil online in the marketplace so it's important to me to always choose a\ncompany that works with high integrity that works with products with\nguaranteeing potency guaranteeing purity. How did you come about to choose the\ncompany that you work with? Great question, I actually went to, I was\ninvited by friends to go, to just to talk about CBD and I kept hearing about it\nover and over again there from my parents or my patients each each morning\nwhen I was at work I kept hearing the patients were using it and the success\nthey had find with it my parents suffer from some chronic arthritic type issues\nand pain issues that I would really wanted to be more knowledgeable about\nwhat CBD is because people kept asking me my opinion on it so I said well I'll\njust go and listen to it just so I can learn what CBD is but the more time I\nspent with this talk I was very much intrigued by the company's grass roots\nmom-and-pop type style business that was literally selecting the exact seed that\nthey're using all the way to the seal that they closed it with it is an all\norganic company they manage every aspect of the growing process to the selling\nprocess and I found that really intriguing that they took out any\nmiddleman and you know it's U.S. grown, it's straight from North Carolina you\nknow where it's coming from and that was very intriguing to me\nbecause there is so many different products out there that you would have\nno idea where it's coming from or what you're getting right a big deal for me\nwith it too is that each of our products have a quality code that everyone can\nlook up and scan and see exactly what you're getting in your model or your\nyour topical cream so it's very important to me to know where it's\ncoming from what's in it in the purity of it so you use it yourself and you\nhave recommended it there's are there reports that you're\nhearing back from others maybe have not seen yourself but others may be\nreporting some benefits that you personally have not seen yeah for sure I\nmy family member one of my family members that's using it has had a\nsignificant decrease in the need for other medications to help her sleep she\npretty severe sleeping issues meeting multitude up to four different\nmedications to help her get a full night sleep never still actually getting into\nit or REM type sleep and feeling rested in the morning and she started with this\ncompany she thought about trying it before to this hesitant not sure what\nshe was getting into so she also actually join me at the meeting and\nlearned about it and purchased the products that night she also is very\ninterested or intrigued with this company and how they're doing things and\nshe is down to one to two of those medications and the CBD oil to help her\nsleep now so when these were all over-the-counter things you know we\nnever would suggest her to get off of a prescription medication unless she's\ntalking with their doctor about it but she was able to get herself down from\nthe over-the-counter stuff by using CBD and it's feeling much more arrested than\ngetting full REM sleep and getting back into dreaming\nmuch more well rested Wow that's fascinating yeah it's pretty amazing\nMike my father as well has also found some great help with sleeping he has\nsuffered over the years from some PTSD and things like that that had a really\nhard time with his sleep patterns he too is using a multitude of things to\nhelp him get some solid rest throughout the night he would always tell a story\nof how he would wake up at a particular set of time throughout every night for\nyears which is kind of an amazing story wake up at the same time each hour\ndirectly throughout the night but that's been going on for as long as I can\nremember the most recent time I checked in with him on how he was doing with the\nCBD oil he says I don't make up with those times anymore so it's it's been a\npretty significant relief for him as well.\nWow so positive benefits do you have any\nconcerns about its use the research I've done shows it to be safe with little\nreport of adverse effects is that what you're seeing reported that to you as\nwell yes I mean my just coming from the medical field and being a nurse I you\nknow I always been doing research on and I'm reading a lot about it\nthe more I read about CBD and the benefits it has for such a wide\nmultitude of problems the more I'm impressed with it but I worry that\nthere aren't enough clinical trials out there that there have the solid\nbackground research on what it's doing with actual human patients you know\nthere's plenty of research out there on this beautiful plant and what it\nactually could do for your body we know what it does and how it helps them\nattend get yourself back to homeostasis but the clinical trials just aren't\nthere and published and that's the piece that always worries me a little bit I\nwant some some proof in the pudding I want to see it on paper but no I have\nnot had any personal negative you know feedback from it so far I think\nsomething that people always are a little bit concerned about a question\nits functionality is you know why didn't it work instantly for me whereas some\npeople do feel that they have some pretty immediate relief from it\nespecially the topical creams with the menthol and things in it for aching\nmuscles and sure joints and things but everyone is completely different with\nCBD oil and how it's going to affect them and how long it's going to take\nit's kind of a based on how does it make you feel like do you need a little bit\nstronger milligram dose do you need to take it twice a day instead of once a\nday so in every one you know some people don't get into a full effect until a\nmonth of having used it consistently so I think that's probably a challenge for\nmost people is how do I figure out exactly how much I need and how long is\nit going to take until it fully affects what I need it to affect mmm in the\nbeginning of the video I described it as a hot and trending topic are you are you\nseeing more and more people be interested in CBD oil\nyes for sure it was when I first started kind of jumping in it researching more\nabout it I was it was this huge explosion of people asking about it over\na really short period of time like I had nurses talking to me about it I have\nfour or five patients that week talking to me about it one of the ones it really\nsticks out of my mind I was just amazed by I was reading over her medications\nthat she takes reviewing it with her and it was on there and I just asked her\nlike you know how are you doing like this evening I'm curious about it I've\nbeen hearing so much and she was a chronic pain patient she was a\nrecovering addict she had been the poster child for addiction she had\nchronic pain she started with pain pills needed to go to the stronger ones to the\nstronger ones and she done into stronger medications because a narcotics didn't\nwork any longer but she luckily now in is a survivor and she said works an\naddict Recovery Center with other addicts which is amazing but she said\nshe still had her pain even though she got through the addiction until she\nfound CBD oil and she says it to her it saved her life she said she even her\npain is significantly less and that she knows she will never have to relapse and\ngo back to some type of pain medication that she finally son found something\nnatural that could take care of her pain yeah that's me\nit is her all right Angela I thank you so much for your time today I value the\nfact that you spent some time and opened your schedule so that we could inform\ndamaged you can inform me about your experience with CBD oil so thank you so\nmuch available my name is Dr. Ryan Shelton. I'm with Zenith Labs, you can\ncheck our website out at Zenithlabs.com we have a Facebook page and\nInstagram page, subscribe and check in each and every week because we post\nvideos for you so that you can learn more about your health and wellness.\nThank you so much!", "AqGwJd5p3yg": "we've got a fun one today I sent restorative botanicals to a lab to see if it's real this is one of Amazon's top-selling CBD products which is funny because Amazon specifically says that they don't sell CBD so is the CBD real or sorry is this hemp oil really CBD let's see the lab tests by the way I bought this one for 20 bucks and I've gotten no affiliation with this CBD company or any CBD company these are the results of an independent lab that I paid directly if the CBD company pays for the lab tests it's not independent shocking I know you might want to let the rest of the internet know about that okay 20 bucks they claimed 400 milligrams of unspecified remember Amazon doesn't sell CBD so they're not gonna list what this is so 400 milligrams and they had a cord indoor lab 433 milligrams of total can monoids or 8.5 percent more cannabinoids men claimed they're even more accurate if you base this on CBD because they had 411 ish milligrams of CBD and it's a high quality full-spectrum extract meaning all these other cannabinoids 13 milligrams of THC not enough to get high by any means but to provide some extra effects and some CBC and CBG I've got to say I was shocked by these results the whole package in a good way kind of confusing way I suppose best CBD on the platform that doesn't sell CBD you can see the labs are here as always the links below for this whole review look at this it's below 5 cents per milligram of CBD and it's also below 5 cents for all of the cannabinoids it's extremely cheap I bought this for 20 bucks on Amazon to get below 5 cents per milligram of CBD for 20 bucks is crazy the average is like 15 cents some go over 30 cents and you're often spending over a hundred dollars to get those price points the more you spend the better deal you usually get not in this case it's cheap let me first say that I don't like that this company or any company sells CBT on Amazon you hear that restorative botanicals you're this close from a timeout Amazon has a specific policy that does not allow for the sale of CBD and I feel this misleads people so they get around this by saying that their hemp oil and full-spectrum to suggest they have CBD they also make some medical claims which is not allowed for CBD companies to say but they don't say they're a CBD company which is a long debate that we don't have time for here here's the craziest part restorative botanicals is US hemp Authority certified it's considered the best cert you can get right now for showing that you're a legitimate company that produces high-quality CBD come on US hemp Authority this company hasn't even transparent about what's in their product how can you give this award to them I also did an extensive review on restorative botanicals and found no negative reports so that's my review and I just realized I'm a little biased because my whole website is about transparency it's all about accurate CV labeling and well this company would fail miserably in that aspect but I can't really knock them they're playing the game they've got an extremely accurate product if you take their hint that they are in fact CBD and the cost is ridiculously low thank you for spending a few minutes with me here today if you want to see more of these independent lab tests and reviews please do me a solvent and lightly tap that subscribe button in like button I'll see you soon", "ARzat3MViEQ": "CBD OILS AND TOPICALS ARE NOW ON\nSTORE SHELVES THROUGHOUT GREATER\nCINCINNATI, AND JEFF MCELFRESH\nCOULDN\u2019T BE MORE PLEASED. >> YOU DON\u2019T GET HIGH.

CBD massage the treatment I'm getting today is a CBD soak combined with the CBD massage and I haven't seen this at any place else I'm really excited to try this treatment come along with me let's figure this out let's see if CBD really makes a difference [Music] my name is Daisy I am the owner and founder of Despard spa it is a very popular service so she will be getting today soaked we are using Cecil combined with CBD we are gonna add some bubbles I'm a central oils to make it a little more fun and relaxed and fluffy she would be in there for 30 minutes and then we're gonna follow her move her into another room and then she's gonna be getting a nice relaxing sport deep tissue massage we're gonna start using our massage oil which is the carrier CBD massage oil though such that we use for the CBD infused massage is 50 milligram per 1 ounce and for the soap is 100 milligrams per 1 ounce the CBD you can get all the fun medical benefits but you're not gonna get high you're not gonna get a positive on drug test for so you can just get all that fun stuff without being high some people some people experience a little tingling sensation everybody's different the benefits are the next day when she goes home you should go to sleep she's gonna wake up like a brand new woman I'm let into this room with this gigantic copper tub candles burning low light huge bubble bath and there's a smell in the air that's a little bit different than a normal bath smell it kind of has a herbal medicinal smell a little bit strong but still looks super inviting the smell is interesting because it smells like well it smells kind of like weed frankly like smell but it's definitely a strong smell the minute I put my toes in the water it was super warm and I immediately felt warm tingles in my legs and once I settled in I started feeling warm tingles all over my legs are fully floating and like tingly warm and tingly not mad at it okay guys just leave me here to soak I'll be here for the next thirty I'm at work right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after the soap go into the massage and that was a very welcomed experience after that warm bath she's using a CBD oil and the CBD oil right when it goes on it immediately you feel like a nice warm tingle and it's mainly afterwards that I still feel that warmth and that tingly feeling from the massage and she left the oil on and I still have the oil on so I still have that heavy warm deep feeling of relaxation I would say it did feel extra relaxed after this because of the CBD which was surprising I actually didn't know if I would feel anything at all I worked out yesterday I worked out pretty hard and I would say all that soreness is gone please let me know what I can be your guinea pig and try next because I'm down to try any beauty treatment so let me know using the hashtag ET style feed [Music] [Applause]", "bfORGbe6f9Q": "how's it going on its Michelle lives in the karate honey and today we're going to be doing something super fun one of the things that I love to do when I'm in training camp and I'm sore for recovery is take a nice hot absent so bad just kind of wraps up my entire day so I thought why not wrap it up and instead of just epson salt bath let's do CVD bath bombs so I'm gonna be using my sponsor CBD CBD distillery and they have this product that is a CBD isolate powder and so what CBD is great for is is a plethora of things so many things but when we're including it in our bath bomb it is going to absorb into our skin and it's gonna help make it helps reduce stress it helps reduce anxiety it helps reduce inflammation it helps with your small eggs in the bruising in the joints so a lot of benefits for athletes or even somebody that is just super busy all day on their feet or he didn't you only have to be physically active you can be mentally active because CBD helps with anxiety it helps with depression so it helps with all sorts of stuff so we got the CBD and then you're gonna need some essential oils essential oils also help with determining what kind of mood you want to be in so if you want it to help you know brighten your spirits and invigorate you you can use sense like orange and maybe some flowery scents and rose up if you want things to relax you you can use things like lavender and cedar what if you want things to help invigorate you you can use sense like spearmint and eucalyptus so the sense that I'm using today gonna be eucalyptus because I just love the fresh smell of it lemon because again it is just a fresh smell um and I think it just ties everything together and adds just a bit of summer Flair and then lavender because the majority of the time when I'm doing bath bombs at the very end of my day and I need something to help lined me down so the lavender does exactly that and then we have all these dry ingredients and wet ingredients so I'm just going to get into it and let you know the exact amount of each thing that you need so here we are and we are going to use the CB distillery I split powder and I use about half of this product so I use half of this product and then we have three tablespoons of Epsom salt Epsom salt is also an anti-inflammatory and it helps with your muscle aches and strains and then we have 1/4 cup of citric acid okay and then we're gonna have 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of baking soda not baking powder baking soda okay so that's all the dry ingredients also I have these very pretty shimmery mica powders and it doesn't stain your bathtub but it does add some color to the water and also to the bath bomb which I love because color can also you know affect your mood and so I'm gonna mix this really pretty green color and this pretty blue color cuz my favorite color is turquoise and I think it will be just very calm and relaxing so we have that and then we have our wet ingredients which is just almond oil and that's just super moisturizing and will help create the right consistency that we need for the bath palms and then so with the with the almond boy oh we're going to use one tablespoon and then we're going to use a half tablespoon of water and then with the with the eucalypt with all of these essential oils we're just going to use I like to get to really smell so I do like three drops of each all right so now that you have all the ingredients let's get started you have to start by mixing all the dry ingredients so here we go half a cup of baking soda 1/4 cup of corn starch 1/4 cup of citric acid and three tablespoons of Epsom salt all right and for the magic ingredient Seaview distillery I flit powder and I've already done a batch of these and I so I use the other half so I'm gonna just pour the rest of it into here all right now for the shimmer oh so pretty I just love shimmer so this color right here is the sky blue and I just ordered these off of Amazon and it came with a bunch of different variety colors so I'm not gonna use the whole thing because my I don't want it to over for wordpower the bath bomb so I just use about not even I think I use about a quarter of the powder and you use about a quarter of this powder oh so pretty alright so now we have all of our dry ingredients and we're gonna mix it so we're mixing it up and it's such a pretty color all the other powers make sure you get it nice and mixed up some people like to grind up the epson salt if you're like bigger chunks got some salt just so that it's easier to break down when you're taking a bath but if you're taking a bath in pretty hot water in a milk pretty fast so now I have a very pretty light blue tart turquoisey color and so my dry ingredients are all mixed up I'm just going to set that aside and put together are my wet ingredients so and I have this little baby spoon that you get from coal stoves after you try the samples so we have the it's a tablespoon of almond oil and you can use any type of oil you can use coconut oil you can use castor oil you can use a Coco oil whatever kind of oil you like and then we got a half a tablespoon of water now once you start doing mix it into your dry ingredients and you feel like the consistency isn't right you can always add more oil and water so here we are I have lavender and I'm going to do a two for party foul alright so three to four drops of lavender one two three what what okay and then we're gonna do some lemon mmm one two three it's so crazy how smells for me anyways bring memories back like certain smells remind me of Thailand de Flor whoops certain smells like eucalyptus remind me of eucalyptus always reminds me of weight cutting because I always liked that smell - to keep me focused and keep me invigorated while I'm cutting weight because it cutting weight can sometimes be quite stressful so I liked using eucalyptus to kind of keep my mind fresh and sharp alright let's bring back our wedding or dry ingredients and we're just gonna slowly pour this in - in and mix so you'll see a little bit of the dry ingredients start to bubble up because of the baking soda and that's exactly what's gonna happen when you put it into the bath and so with the bath bombs there's all different kind of sized molds but I would get the biggest mold that you can find because I mean my bathtub was super huge and you want to have enough ingredients for for it to be effective so you just pour and mix see it bubble up a little bit that's okay and you'll start to feel the powder get a little thicker alright here's the last bit of it and then we mix and mix and mix it so again the consistency should be like damp sand and once you have the right consistency you can go ahead and start filling up your mold your mold here is that is that right your mold the your mold yeah so some people they like to put like flowers some people like to put oatmeal um you like to mix it with milk some people like to put big chunks of lotion in the middle you can put us up like if you're making this for your friend or something you can put like a cute little surprise in the middle I don't know get creative all right so I got my consistency and I'm gonna go ahead and feel yeah so so when you pick it up you should be able to smash it and it will stick together so if you can smash it ahead and it sticks together that's the right consistency okay and I'm going to use my big mold in the in the and the molds that I got I got three different kinds so that the big mold is basically four baths and then the medium mold or for pedicures and then the small molds are firm miniatures so you just go ahead and fill it up feel a fill fill fill it up okay so once you feel that we're gonna Pat it down nice and tight hey gosh is such a pretty color okay so I Pat it down nice and tight one side okay and then you're gonna go ahead and do that to the other side fill it up Pat it down fill it up pat it down okay so now that they're both the both sides are filled up what I like to do is I just like to overfill it on both sides and then you smash them together so then when you smash all together you're just gonna turn turn turn turn turn and just keep turning it until you hear them grinding together and you have to give your bath bombs 24 hours to dry okay so if you have like if you want to double this ingredient or something if you have a group of people you want to make this for just you know double the ingredients but be careful when you're taking these out of the mold let her try for 24 hours so here's what the mold looks like and so I let it dry for 24 hours and then when you're done and I actually I like to put mine in the refrigerator just helps helps it dry up so now I'm gonna have some extra left over so I'm gonna put it in my pedicure one and again I'm just gonna I don't know maybe is this do I have enough powder left no let's do the manicure one see some when you take it out it is already pretty hardened so you can definitely take it out of the mold and set it aside to dry for 24 hours but if you're only making a couple I would just leave them in the mold okay so now we're going to the manicure one so this is perfect for like for me because I was wrestling yesterday and I dislocated my ring finger on my left hand and it hurts so bad and I didn't even bother to look down at it I already knew it was out and so I just snapped it back into place and that's probably what would have happened anyways if I waited any longer it probably would have start swelling so I snapped it back into place and it seemed fine but when I got home it started to swell and even today I don't know if you can tell but it's swollen this is my finger it's swollen so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use one of these bath bombs just for my hand and let my hands soak so that it pulls some of that inflammation out and helps reduce the swelling of my finger so anytime you're swollen up anytime like if you heat and cold or are really good so but for for instances like this you need heat so you can circulate get new blood circulating into that I went a bit too long but we're almost finished anyways so I got my bath mold set together and then I just did a little manicure one so that's enough and I have just a little bit left so when you're done putting in the mold and you want to use a mold for more you just get a tap the edges and then carefully take the top off and again carefully turn it over and then it should just pop out and it'll be a perfectly smooth remember guys give it 24 hours to dry and then what I did was I wrapped them up with some tissue paper I put some cute like confetti in there and put a little cute tag on there and I'm gonna give them to some of my teammates as gifts because we all beat each other up on a daily basis so it's only fair that I them something to help with their recovery I hope you guys enjoyed it remember I use CB distillery isolate powder for this CBD bath bomb if you'd like to try it all the ingredients are down below and if there's anything else that you think would be interesting for us to do as a fighter mom slash wife let me know in the comments below I hope you guys have a lovely day and enjoy your CBD bath bombs one love", "pf7uWK-slHQ": "[Music] hi it's Madame ruffle studios and welcome to cannabase ik's today we're making a cannabis infused pain relief topical this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at pharmacies and also online if you'd like to learn where to get these ingredients and to see the full written recipe please check out our blog site for free on the link in description or here on the screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles and joints and other general topical useless and to answer this inevitable question in advance no this does not get you high it's a simple old-school home remedy that is not intended to produce any psychedelic effects this

properties not only just for skin conditions but the things that they're used to treat is absolutely phenomenal this shampoo right here is sulfate free there's no artificial dyes or since its parabens and falafels eats and I'm sure I just showed that word but it's a right there it's free of that stuff too and it's most importantly not tested on animals this I'm not sure about the CBD amounts on this they did make it public when it first came out and I had a screenshot of it which I lost I believe that the shampoo is either 25 or 50 milligrams of cannabidiol per bottle but let me tell you what I'm super excited about is all of these steam distilled essential oils in here and herbal extracts this is high-quality stuff guys you should see the list it's huge and you can actually go to my

this is high-quality herbal extracts in here I mean it's got licorice mulberry leaf mmm peppermint lavender obviously they have oil and then there's this long list the scientific names of all the herbs and all of these don't have an English name they're all from China and they are just absolutely amazing what they treat you know both on the skin and inside the body eternally to which I'm sure that some of that will be absorbed through the pores on your skin and get taken into your body so this stuff smells amazing man and I've actually I've been using it in my beard and it's been making my beards smell nice and fresh and extra soft too so I'm kind of got a bonus out of that so yeah there's the cyber derm hemp clean shampoo and here is the hemp CBD sob I know for a fact that there's 40 milligrams of cannabidiol in this and this is for minor aches and pains I was told by a friend that it works great on migraines that he actually put it all on his forehead on his temples and it worked fantastic I knew that with other products similar to this that have Hemery in them that they recommend that you melt it down a little bit kind of put it somewhere warm and get it to almost liquefy rub it in I don't know if that would make this work better or not it doesn't say anything on that but again the the list thermal extracts in this is long and impressive as well so yeah you guys can check these out I have the full line I have the shampoo the conditioner the body care or the body wash the hand cream the soft on top of offering the law selection of 100% federally legal CBD rich creams

where I teach you all about Young Living Essential Oils and today we're going to be talking about a product that Young Living has not come out with yet it is called CBD oil hey guys welcome to the channel normally I start with like a box and I'm pulling product out I'm telling you how I use it and how much I love it and or you know whatever but actually today we're gonna be talking about a product that Young Living does not have yet we will be seeing it in 2019 from them so um we're gonna be talking about CBD oil but before we talk about that let's talk about some things that I think need to be addressed let's talk about hemp versus marijuana let's talk about CBD versus THC let's talk a little bit about the history and uses and things like that okay so if you're ready to nerd out with me this is the channel for you alright so a CBD oil what is CBD oil CBD oil is oil derived from him okay Young Living CBD oil will be organic hemp that then we derived the the CBD from so let's talk about let's talk about cannabis and hemp in marijuana because those are words that we hear and a lot of people I think think they're exactly the same thing so cannabis is like the umbrella term okay it's like the overarching family of the plants and then you have him and you have marijuana and they are not the same plant okay they look similar and everything they're in the same plant family but they're not the same plant so you've got cannabis and you've got him and you've got marijuana now the main constituent of him is going to be C B that's canna been like stink at pronouncing things I apologize canna Biddy all can a vide all and I may be saying that I go quickly because I usually do canna Biddy all is CVD oil and then over here we have marijuana okay same cannabis family different plant marijuana has the main constituent is THC I will try to pronounce this for you it is tetra hydro canna bin all tetrahydrocannabinol THC is in marijuana in him we have CBD okay CBD is legal in all 50 US states marijuana is legal in 30 US states okay different they're different things so recently the fda approved CBD like as a drug called at the dole x Epidaurus for treatment of to specific epileptic orders and so what does that say that says that that people are taking notice that CBD can help with specific things so these specific synthesized drugs that were created are to help these seizure disorders now I'm going okay wait where did they get the idea to use CBD for that well that's because CBD has been used like around the world for a long time to help people with different things it's got antidepressant properties anti-anxiety properties and there are protective properties alright so um it's used oftentimes in the management and treatment of like chronic pain PTSD anxiety issues depression type 1 and 2 diabetes seizures brain trauma and even for help with the side effects of chemotherapy okay so how does CBD oil even help like how does it work so let's let speak out together for a minute and toxin chemistry and biology okay CBD actually binds to the specific receptors in our brain it's like the information pathways of our brain it's like our brain talking to our brain okay and then our brain talking to our body these are these information pathways and so the CVD oil actually binds to those and helps with the communication there so what are some things the neural protective effects brain neural brain protection there's actually been studies done where CVD helped hinder the development of Alzheimer's symptoms which Alzheimer's is literally the breaking down of the brain it's the degradation of our brain so CVD has actually been shown to stop the degradation the breaking down of the brain in Alzheimer's patients imagine what it can do on a proactive level for healthy people who have healthy brains imagine that that's amazing to me all right also there's analgesic effects like pain killing effects from CBD so it's proven itself useful especially for chronic pain sufferers because it inhibits the neural transmission that would cause what's called analgesic tolerance so if you guys have ever heard of people getting addicted to painkillers and they need a higher and higher and higher and higher and higher dose in order to feel the same effects they used to fuel down here that's because their brains are going okay I need a that little bit isn't doing it anymore it's called analgesic tolerance they build up a tolerance to it a higher tolerance and then they use mourn and they build a higher tolerance and that's how people get super addicted to painkillers but CBD has not been shown to have any analgesic tolerance meaning it can be really good for chronic pain sufferers because their bodies won't require more and more and more over time there's not those addictive properties that you would find with with actual like street drugs right or even pharmaceutical drugs that we have the market today so um CVD can can really be beneficial for chronic pain sufferers also CVD has been shown to have an antitumoral effect and that's a big deal guys um studies have shown that high doses of CVD has no toxic effect on humans but that with patients with related tumor conditions um that it can be extremely amazing for its antitumoral properties cancer patients this is like I mean breast cancer lung cancer any tumor or cancer this is this is a gate this can be a game-changer for you right on a more like maintenance basis CBD oil has proven very effective on anxiety and depression so it has been shown to reduce anxiety and patients there was a study done with CBD oil and placebo oil and the CBD it given to patients and I want to make sure I'm gonna read this so I make sure that I get it totally correct I don't I love to give you guys like the best information but like accurate information from the studying that I have done a 2011 study the test was administered to 24 patients with social anxiety disorders so an hour and a half before the test the patients were even either given CBD or they were given a placebo and it was found that the anxiety the cognitive impairment and the discomfort of the patients with the CBD was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group so the patients who actually ingested the CBD found that their anxiety that their cognitive ability and that their discomfort all improved right they were more comfortable like more cognitively able to function their cognitive function was higher and their anxiety was lower the so for for a study of this like this obviously more study needs to be done 24 patients is not a large amount sample size but it does lead us to believe that there definitely could be some really positive effects there now many people will claim of their own that yes this is what CVD does for me so this is just a small test that was administered to see if that potentially could be the case and they are seeing really positive test effects in that way so CBD also affects our serotonin system your serotonin system is actually what helps regulate your metabolism right your cortisol levels of cortisol is out stress hormone that causes weight gain right so it helps regulate your metabolism your reactions to stress so that's the serotonin system also your social behavior this is what we're talking about those anti-anxiety effects right those antidepressant effects your mood your cognition your appetite like these are all very positive things to be regulated and to help your body regulate because CBD actually targets the serotonin receptor that a one receptor it it can help with all of those things so a lot of people have said to me April why is Young Living getting in the CBD game right like what is going on there well as of December 20th 2019 CBD oil is now given the a-ok the agricultural Improvement Act was signed December 20th of 2019 so hemp was actually removed from the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 which means it's no longer an illegal substance under federal law now it's going to be over overseen by the FDA the Food and Drug Administration so you may be going wait a minute why was it illegal in the first place I'm glad you asked my history buffs take a tour with me let's go way way back so researchers believe that hemp might have actually been one of the earliest plants cultivated by man traces of him found it like a specific Japanese archaeological site that's over like 8,000 years old all right it is believed that humans started like actual agriculture ten thousand years ago so this could have been one of the first right plants that man cultivated hello very cool but more than that hip traditionally over the centuries over the millennia have been used up has been used for things like rope guess what guys Christopher Columbus on his ship his ropes were made of hemp because hemp made it all the way through it's very prolific in the northern hemisphere it was very prolific in the northern hemisphere growing wildly so it was use rope clothing paper guys the Gutenberg Bibles printed on him early draft of the American Declaration of Independence printed or written on him the final draft was on parchment but the early drafts were written on him also it is believed that the first u.s. flag was hand sewn with him and you Betsy so obviously it has like a very long history and in the Americas in the USA it has a really long history him was grown throughout the USA like commercially right as a cash crop and and actually King George required the colonists to grow it and then taxed him on it in order to support the crown but at least seven different US presidents grew hemp as a cash crop now him also grew wild here in the US in Jamestown hemp was growing wild and there's reports that like Native Americans were already cultivating hemp here in the United States when colonists arrived um also it's been used over the years medicinally as farm feed in textiles right all those things that I already mentioned for so long livestock cows chickens pay were grazing on him wild growing him and it was part therefore of the standard us diet right because all the animals were eating it and then our we're getting it in our eggs and in our chicken and all that and so the benefits are all affecting our body so April get back to the elite illegal ization what's going on there 1937 the marihuana Tax Act happened which taxed anybody who was growing any kind of cannabis hemp or marijuana why conspiracy theorists take note that the passing of the Act - is believed that it was literally just to destroy the hemp industry there's speculation that Andrew Mellon Randolph Hearst which you guys might be familiar with he was a newspaper printer and the DuPont family and if you're going wait I know the name DuPont plastics and nylon that they were all behind this marijuana Tax Act in order to destroy the hemp industry so that trees could continue to be used for paper thank you newspapers and the newspaper manufacturers that had huge stock in forests and the forestry industry and also the plastics and nylon industry which was very up-and-coming in the 1930s so conspiracy theorists go to town on that one I don't know the truth of that but it follow the money right ok so we go from hemp growing wild hemp being used by our presidents seven different presidents growing him him being used commercially right like all of this - there's a huge tax on it well then according to reports not only that the tax was was actually really opposed by doctors and pharmacists who then obviously they're being taxed on it they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa CBD hemp is really helpful for our patients it's not it could add rug and it's not addicting why are we doing this right and so they really opposed it it's still passed well then in 1970 that marihuana taxation Act was actually just adopted into the Controlled Substances Act so him marijuana were we're always kind of lumped together and they just got put right in the controlled substance act and guess what it made him on par with heroin and ecstasy as far as being a schedule 1 controlled substance so you in the u.s. we we couldn't touch it we couldn't do anything right well it was the ban was lifted for final product so you could import final products of hemp like clothing and things of that nature but you couldn't be the producer because that was a schedule 1 controlled substance so I mean I asked my husband if this would lend me any credibility in this situation at which one he said no but I thought it timely to mention that April's always been a pretty big supporter of him because this is my actual purse and wallet that I used as a teenager god I feel old right now this is 20 years old um I bought this when I was 14 I remember where I was and who I was with I was in ninth grade and I bought this hemp purse made in Nepal and a hemp wallet and I carried this literally it held up so well I carry this from ninth grade through sophomore year of college like until I got married I carried this for literally like what is that like five six years like six years I carried this in a hell so nicely quite honestly really really well-made product look at that it gets got this little hemp rope connector right here that this is all woven him on the the actual back it's lined with cotton but um this baby has held up it's a little crossbody satchel do you know what it was the perfect size for holding when I turn it when I was 17 I became a Christian and I got a Bible this is the perfect size from my Bible no joke and I felt like so so super blessed I was like obviously this is meant to be this Bibles from the Lord because it fits perfectly in my hip bag I have made two international moves and literally have almost nothing for my teenage years quite honestly like very few things no clothing at all which really do I want clothing from the 90s but I did keep this I have kept this for years and years and years lending a little credence to my hemp history here but ok so you couldn't grow hemp and you could not sell Hampton you could not do anything with him in the United States um fast forward 50 years 2019 the president signs V what is it Colin I make sure I use the right term agricultural Improvement Act it is no longer illegal to grow and sell and produce hemp products yay so people have said why is why is wild getting into this game we have been waiting for this to happen as an international company as a right as a company that provides product to all 50 states we wanted to make sure that everybody in the US could have access to this now um people have also said mmm April why are what's going on here is like you I want you guys to know that for me personally I have done research on CVD for years and I never pulled the trigger and here is why you guys know this sourcing is so big for me trusting that what I'm paying for is what I'm getting is such a big deal to me and that's why I chose to join Young Living when I got into essential oils because there were so many essential oil companies on the market I was buying my essential oils from Whole Foods and when I found out how unregulated that industry was I was like wait a minute so you're saying when I buy my oils from Whole Foods that say pure it only has to be like 5% essential oil and the rest can all be chemical synthetics and it still says pure yeah that blew my mind like how could producers do that well because it's a really unregulated industry and CBD oil is very similar there's so many companies springing up producing and in having CBD oil but I have no assurance of the sourcing I don't know if it was really truly drone organically if that workers were paid a fair wage if there's pesticides like you don't really know right young living with our seed to seal promise always consistently over and over again they put everything they're named behind the behind the production of their products from planting the seed all the way until sealing that bottle Young Living says look we're gonna do everything we can to make sure to bring the highest quality product to the market so Young Living is going ok here we go this is how we do this this is how we bring our people the best quality oil is that we make sure that we're taking care of the production the seed of steel standards way above and beyond the standards of any other essential oil company this very unregulated industry CVD very unregulated industry young livings way we can provide a really high quality product the highest quality product for our people organic hemp non THC organic hemp derived CBD oil infused with essential oils why why would they do that two reasons one you get the benefit of the essential oil and we've talked so many times that's why you're on this channel of essential oils and the benefits for your body in different ways okay but then too here's something I found so interesting and Young Living hasn't come out and said this but in my own research this is what I found and I think that it is really awesome CBD oil there's been studies done the beet oral bioavailability bioavailability is how your body can use the product okay the oral bioavailability of CD oil is somewhere between like 13 and 19% the inhalation bioavailability is somewhere between 11 and 45% with like the mean that you know the average being 31% so if oral ingestion the oral bioavailability of CBD is 13 to 19 percent and we know there have been studies done that essential oils increase the bioavailability of products so all of our supplements are infused with essential oils because you get the property of the essential oil that beneficial property but also it increases the bioavailability of whatever that supplement is so Young Living is going hey cv DOL is an amazing product our oils are amazing put those together and it's exponential the essential oils actually help the CBD oil to be more available to your body which means you use less with a greater efficiency hey yo thank you Young Living so I am super duper excited like I said I never pulled the trigger on CBD oil and the main reason was I didn't know who to trust there was never anybody where I went oh yeah okay you you're transparent about your practices your trans paranoid about how you farm I know where you're growing this I know who the supplier is you know what I mean nobody does that in essential oils or CBD Young Living is the only one that's doing that you know blooming doing one that's going look we're gonna control the whole supply process in order to make sure that there's no fudging anywhere because when you you guys know when you it's like a game of telephone right somebody starts it somebody produces it and then they pass it on and there's a ability for it to be corrupted in that and then the next person doesn't know that it's been corrupted and they think they're getting the original pure product and then the corruption potentially could continue and so other essential oil companies other CBD oil companies can say oh that supplier over there we didn't know that they were doing whatever practice that is undesirable we're just not gonna work with them anymore we're gonna work over here with these people now the only they will never do that to us because they put their name behind everything they own the farms or we have partner farms that work exclusively with us and adhere to our seed to seal standards which I set told you are above and beyond the industry standards like so far above me beyond so now that there's finally a source that I can trust for CBD oil I am super duper excited and you should be too Organic have CVD oil infused with essential oils this is going to be the utmost highest-quality CBD oil on the market and I am so excited so here's the deal if you've not yet joined Young Living if you're like mmm now's the time here's why this is

hemp well so hemp oil being let's see not a huge portion of the self it's about 10% of my oils but it's a very dark oil and has some really great benefits for your skin I'm not fragrancing this one so I'm leaving it natural you might get some of the nuttiness off the hemp oil has a very distinct odor to it but it's not it's more gonna be an unscented soap and for colorants I'm going to do part of this in a French green clay I have mixed in with some of my soaking oils and for the uncolored portion I'm using not titanium dioxide but I'm using the sweet rice flour which I've used before in soaps and if you do some reading on it you'll see that the the geishas used to they may still use the sweet rice flour in their skincare regimen it's great for lightening the skin lightening any blemishes so that's what I'm doing today so we're gonna get things going here I'm gonna pour most of my white or should I say natural color in I'm gonna swirl with the French green clay leaving white on the top and then I'm putting on some hemp seeds after I texture the top I'm just gonna run a little bit of hemp seeds down the side so that is my plan I'm just straightening out my little swirly to earlier get my goggles on and we'll get to blending this adding my lye in it's always nice once in a while just to have a nice unscented soap like this something that's good for your skin but you know you don't have the perfumey fragrance oils or essential oils in there just just a nice soap to clean with [Music] you can see the color already it's just a lovely creamy color [Music] [Applause] I'm going to pour some of this off to make my green with not a lot just a bit like so just enough to swirl in the batter so we'll pour there the green in there get my spatula that's gonna be stirred in my hands and then the portion with our rice flour as well this one I'm going to blend a bit with the hand mixer just to make sure I get that rice flour incorporated really well [Applause] you can see it's not changing the color it's a white car it's just adding the rice so that that is good clean this off is it just a very basic simple soap nice and fluid so far look at the green in here from the French screen clay it's about a heaping teaspoon full I put in here and blended with my soapy oils so bring this bring this over occasional hemp seed fall in here I'm just picking those out here I've got these wonderful hemp seeds if you can see there we go beautiful beautiful the little something-something to top this with okay so I'm going to pour pretty much all of this in I'll save that much to put on the top just in case there's some green that shows up on top and here we go with the green and clean that out we'll get this swirled and I'm gonna stamp it with one of the victor stamps another one that he sent me and I'll link you in the box below to his shop on Etsy but I figured since I'm doing green kind of in this soap we're gonna make it for March first st. Patrick's Day and I'm gonna use this stamp to stamp it with after it's a little four-leaf clover so anyway that'll be cute so just giving it a swirl like so cleaning off my tool that's best I can there okay and then we'll spoon in the rest of this white onto the top pour it in I guess it's still pretty fluid hopefully we can cover pretty much all of this green cuz I like to have just the white on the top speak the rest of this in here trying to do this at an angle where I'm not blocking your view so I think we're pretty good here see if I can scrape this bit just so just trying to get every little bit I can out of here okay now I'm just gonna kind of cover the top I'm going to texture this I think so that green might show back up on the top anyway bang this down onto the floor here still have my glasses on cuz you're doing every you want to bang yourself down you wanna make sure you protect your eyes okay so there's that nice clean spoon at this point I'm gonna take my glasses off because I'm done with this with the blending it's such a etc I'm just gonna tidy my area here and I've got my hemp seeds and these these are edible these are food grade but you don't want to eat your soap naturally so we'll bring you in a little bit closer and hopefully won't take too long for this to set now just give it a little a little texture on the top and see if let's see if it holds or if my soap is still too soft as you'll know if it starts to disappear down into itself after a minute or two just trying to get some interest here it's so delicate and I just I can't help I love to play with the soap anyway I think that's alright that's gonna hold so now I'm gonna take my gloves back off and we'll sprinkle some of our hemp seeds on top I'll just bring you in just a hair and I'm just going to aren't they lovely they're so natural looking and just the perfect addition to the top of our hemp soap like I said I just want to go down one side and then we'll be back it'll be tomorrow for me and we'll use chopper to cut this beautiful soap and and then we'll do some stamping with our little clover stamp I know Victor does have a hemp stamp too I believe anyway I think I saw that on his site but I wanted to do something like I said in honor of st. Patrick's Day when I see my booboo but that's what we've got and we'll be back in just a moment to do the cut okay we're back and ready to use chopper to cut our hemp soap and I'm just going to cut the end slices off just to get to the color under hopefully and take that first slice off so there's our little end slice you can see the pretty little swirl I really like that don't worry I will we'll zoom out and get a good shot here when I'm done cutting and we're ready to stamp I'm just gonna adjust this actually let me get the other side and slice I'm cutting with the hemp seeds slide down so they don't drag through the soap when I cut it I love how chopper works look at that beautiful swirl with the French green clay it's just gorgeous okay so let me finish I'm going to measure my loaf and and then I'll see how many even slices I can get about 8 and a half inches so I think if I do for sure one inch and then I'll have a little bar left for myself so let me set this for an inch right about there tighten that down and we'll start cutting you get these beautiful bars oops see I almost cut wrong side I'm gonna have my hemp seeds facing down so there's a beautiful beautiful bar look at the pretty swirls and I have I haven't decided whether I want to bevel these or not I know I want to stamp them though with Viktor stamp so pretty we have a beautiful sunny day here but very cold a nice so it'll be nice to go shopping today it's Saturday and we'll have nice sunshine and it will just have to bundle up we had tons of heavy wind last night so pretty I just love this can't mine there we go love the swirls love love-love-love such a nice natural bar with no fragrance and here's our last cut very pretty so I'm going to put you on pause and I'll get a range to do some stamping and we'll be right back alright so we're all set up and ready to do our stamping and give you a better view of the lovely swirls that are going on in this soap period of natural I love the natural colorant the rice flour and the French screenplays wonderful so okay I've got my four leaf clover stamp here from Victor and it's soap stamps for you and I'm going to spray that again with a little bit of alcohol and we're gonna place our little stamp right in the center of each bar like so beautiful you can't see it like a lot because of the color of the soap but it's just gorgeous and we'll zoom in for a close-up here in a second but you can see cute little four-leaf clover and it's just adorable give it another spritz and finish these last few bars and like so let me Bob them up a little paper towel here just to get that shine off a bit so you can see the stamp it's so pretty and we'll put these right back by each other they kind of you kind of got a little bit of a butterfly effect going so anyway I'll take this out and you can look see so there's our little four-leaf clover I like that one almost looks like a bat or an O or somebody standing there with wings spread out that's kind of cool another one here and here's some good swirling going on in this so again this is the the a four-leaf clover stamp from soap stamps for you on Etsy I'll link you in the box below to his Etsy store stamps were provided to me at no charge Victor song gonna highlight a different one every now and then in my videos but for now this was our hemp oil soap and we put in sweet rice flour and the green is from French green clay no fragrance just pure natural with the little hemp parts on the top really pretty and thank you for watching I appreciate you tuning in and we'll catch you on the next video and we'll say bye for now", "DFGeBTuz-XY": "[Music] my name is Greg I'm a firefighter/paramedic 44 years old we're currently sitting here in my my CrossFit gym but across the gym when I work out I try to do a lot of competitions as much as I can like a set of 44 years old I'll consider our masters athlete what I was looking for in the CBD product and I had tried - there was a roll-on with methylate a minute and then I had some mom and I really had no idea how or how it was gonna work or how it may or may not affect me or how what it would feel like I'm pretty good about knowing my body and how it feels when I do try something it's kind of like either it works or it doesn't but I did find with the CBD is the lasting effects kind of chill your muscles out and so I was using it when I wasn't working out especially it worked when I'm running calls all day you know aches and pains from sitting and moving patients picking up people in difficult positions and you'd get you know a crick in your neck or whatever like a muscle spasm or cramp and I would throw it on there just to see if it would work and and it's kind of passive it's not like it wasn't like immediate I kind of realized that yeah my muscle chilled out and I was feeling I was feeling better [Music] my hands get tore up as well really really sore from gripping a lot of things it worked really well on my hands because it was muscular it was the surface of my my skin and whatnot and it really did chill out my hands pretty well I spent a lot of time in the gym outside of work trying to keep myself healthy mentally physically and then also with nutrition like I said I know my body well so it's pretty easy for me to tell you if it's working or not for me [Music]", "WOTXvwksUAU": "hello everyone today we're going to be making lotion we're going to be taking you through it step by step the first step that we're going to do is we're going to fill our sink full of very strong bleach water everything no matter if it's clean will actually pre wash it so everything goes in there with dawn antibacterial detergent and bleach everything gets bleached you want to put out paper towels and you want to put everything out on those to dry um then it doesn't matter if they completely Drive it's good to let them drip good then you will take ninety one percent alcohol hang on in a spray bottle and you will then spray everything down and dry it with paper towels the alcohol makes contact with the water and it causes you to be able to get every bit of water out of your containers and then you want to set those not under a ceiling fan and in a clean sanitary area on top of your paper towels until you're ready to use them and it's sort of good if you can do this ahead of time and leave time for evaporation okay here is an example we've just washed this pot it has a residue of water in it and we've added alcohol see it doesn't have the shiny appearance of any moisture the alcohol causes the water to be completely removed all right then we're going to set our jars out and I've got a little clip showing you exactly how to take care of your jars okay I have my jars here fresh from the plastic bag I made sure that I had alcohol with my hands we keep 91% alcohol in a spray bottle now I'm going to get over the top of them and I'm going to spray them then we'll let that evaporate and then these jars are ready for the lotion to be added all right and then after we've taken care of our jars let them set over there and and evaporate then we're going to measure it by our oils all of your hard all will go in a double boiler and be melted all of your liquid oils that means they're liquid now they don't have to be melted will be measured and put into another container of the sanitary containers every time you touch something that is not sanitary you must rewatch your hands and we alcohol your hands okay all right so you will put your liquid oils in one container you'll put your hard in a double boiler if you're using stearic acid and I know you'll be using emulsifying wax you'll put those together into a pot those don't have to go into a double boiler but if you overheat them they burn if you if you let them cool down to cool before you add them to your lotion you just have little knobs of stearic acid and emulsifying wax floating all through your lotion so they have to be warm and melted when they go in your oils for emulsification all right so the first thing you will do get your liquids all in one poll your hard oils and your stearic acid emulsifying wax on the stove double boiler dereck acid in a pot and your massa fine wax in a good thick stainless steel maybe copper bottom pot those you will hate gently slowly because we don't want to diminish their values for skin by overheating them and while that's happening you're going to measure up your glycerin and vitamin e your preservative in separate little containers and any other ingredients that's needed I will be adding a recipe for the I'll be adding a recipe ingredients at the end of the video right now we're going to talk about safety safety safety we must keep our hands clean there's two rules of thumb put on gloves but then when I put on gloves and I touch my face I don't feel it I forget that I've done it I don't realize so I just keep scrubbing my hands and alcohol in my hands in bleach water and don't dish detergent is how I wash and then alcohol and using paper towels constantly through the process because if bacteria is in your oils and lotion when you put your preservative in there it's not it's already got something it's got to fight right there so we want to make sure that there's no bacteria or germs goes into our product so another example of that is when you have a brand new bottle of olive oil that's what you want to use to make lotion not one that you poured back some into when you were measuring to make soap you want to have a brand new block of shea butter brand new contain our cocoa butter if you're using it you want all your liquids to be fresh bottles that have not been opened and possibly poured back into or there are 3/4 of the way down you want fresh intake oils that you're just opening up we cannot have bacteria when we're working with lotion everything is sanitary as possible as fresh as possible is the way to go all right ok so now we're going to get to the process of mixing it all together but I do want to talk to you about your water when you're bowling your water your water has to boil for at least 20 minutes if there's going to be a vibration during that process so you want to put way more than what you need to boiling so that you'll have the right amount when you get ready to measure and even in the pot when you're measuring it into your lotion pot and you're going to make lotion I always put a little bit extra because once you put it in you just see the steam coming up carrying your water away so because of evaporation I always add just a little extra to my water pot all right let's start making lotion okay so now we are measuring the water into a bowl sitting on a scale and we're measuring out how much we need our bowl will not hold all of it if you can see the steam from evaporation occurring as we speak so that means water is dissipating from our Bowl as we're adding it so get that to a flat ounce so that's 40 point one will throw the point one in for our extra so we write down 40 so now we'll dump that into the ocean making pot set it back on our scale and so now we have 80 in our pot and we need how much 160 160 so as you can see she is measuring 240 and by doing a flat amount it's just easier to do on a calculator so she's going to go up to 40 each time there she goes she's going to write down 40 I'm going to add 40 to the calculator because we can't clean this because it's my phone so now we have 120 all right so we needed 20 30 40 50 60 so we need 40 exactly more and then we're going to put in two extra ounces for evaporation okay so 42 more - yep 42 and that's because we're using a large batch if you are using a small batch you would add less extra all right we have our melted oils they are warm we have our liquid oils they are room temperature we have our vitamin E and our glycerin and our two preservatives that I use we have our water over here in the water pot and we're ready to go okay the first thing I'm going to add is my hot oils being careful I've kept these on low on the stove on warm excuse me once I got to melt it to being sure checking with a thermometer not to get them too hot so that I don't diminish their skin print properties then the next thing is our room temperature oils if you're doing a liquid oil only recipe you need to heat these oils but because the water is warm or hot and the oils are hot there was no need to heat these oils alright now we'll need the stearic acid I've kept get on the stove on low excuse me warm once I got them melted because it goes back to a hard state in seconds all right you'll pour that in and there goes lotion sit it back over there on the stove but off of a hot I jump and turn that off now if we look now we have little floaties of oil floating on the top of our surface see those sometimes you have to add more emulsifying wax then you originally thought you would need if that happens you just add a little bit of time until you get it fully emulsified but you also have to process this with your stick blender for a good period of time and so it was time to be watching and waiting for unsupportive five or unmod okay now we wait we're going to wait and as this cools we're going to keep an eye on the temperature but as this cools we will watch this for temperature and we want to get it down to 160 degrees for our essential oils and 140 degrees before our preservative goes in now I'm using unrefined organic shea butter and unrefined organic cocoa butter sometimes you will have things that will float to the top like little husk particles and things of that sort so this is a good time to get those out as well so as I'm watching for the temperature I will watch for things like that as well okay guys I'm going to bring you in it might be difficult for you to see but there is some floating oil cocoa butter particularly is one that's very difficult to work with for full of most of vocation okay so I've added one ounce of stearic acid and see how it goes back to a solid very easy I think let me pull this back now okay right there it's going back to a solid so you have to be really cautious with this once you ain't but you can't overheat it it burns I like to definitely have my stick blender on it when I'm putting it in to a already made lotion for the bulk of it not to go flat to the bottom set that on an off I've added an extra ounce if you're doing much smaller batches of course it would be much smaller amount all right we will measure our temperature again we're well under 160 so we could add our essential oils at this point right here is 140 and we're sitting right on it we're not going over so we're ready to put our preservative in so I'm going to go ahead and do that step okay so now we're going to add our vitamin E and glycerin after the temperature has been brought down some and I just like to not put it in when it's super hot and I use paraben and formaldehyde free preservative I try to keep things as natural as possible so jarm prevention because I'm not using what's considered a full broad-spectrum preservative trying to go more natural I'm not not using a preservative I'm just not using one that is acid rain to most of us and that's me pacifically I break out okay now I'm going to add my essential oils okay we're under 160 and now we're going to add our essential oils I'm using tumeric in this one so it's going to turn my lotion yellow being very cautious with how much tumeric you use if you use it giving things a thorough beating with your stick blender did you see that last little drop that fell out of my dish all right giving everything a thorough blending is very important okay so now we're going to fill our pour our pour spouts okay I bought these from a you can get these from Amazon I forget where I bought these and then somebody told me you can get them from Amazon um I like to use something with a handle that I can hang on the side because I'm going to fill this and then hand this over to b2b take it from that side so it won't drip on our clean dishes over there alright and for for us to start filling our containers over on the other table but then I can just hang that and it's waiting on me for when I'm ready to refill more so there you go don't leave any in there because it'll start thickening okay so we're tilting slowly bringing it back to level and going all the way to the fill line okay now to prepare our lids we're going to prepare our lids on a clean surface that has been bleached and alcohol and dried with paper towels fresh paper towels just opened up the plastic off of the roll cleanliness is next to germ free lotion mm-hmm all right so we're going to get them like that we're going to take our pump bottle and we're going to miss them just like that and then we're going to set them to let that evaporate an air dry okay here is our beautiful creams all laid out and ready to go these will sit overnight here on the table don't add the lids if you add the lids Moisture will come up and get on the bottom of the lid and then fall down on top of your jar and you'll have a water layer so they need to sit overnight until room temperature and then you add your lids alcohol your jars and add your labels all of these jars are four ounce jars I don't make bigger than four ounce jars because I use a more natural preservative if you want to use a broad-spectrum preservative then you can do larger jars okay I got just a little bit of the cream from the bottom of the container this is my night cream so this is heavier than my day cream of course 100% natural when it comes to know preserve I mean no preservatives that are full broad-spectrum with formaldehyde and parabens and no Vaseline petroleum fillers 100% oil that kind of thing okay so this is our heavy cream it'll take a little bit to soak in it'll lay on the skin just for a few minutes before it soaks in because it's meant for really dry skin I also make a day cream I'm going to give you the recipe for the day cream okay we are on wholesalesuppliesplus.com this is their batch calculator I'm hoping this video comes out good off of my screen I'm going to print the recipe and also add that clip to the actual just of the paper so if you can't read this we will add that in a moment so I talked to you the fact that we were going to do the day cream recipe so when you first get on the page this is the wholesalesuppliesplus.com you will add the the name of your recipe so this is day cream okay then we want to add our ingredients and we have shea butter coconut all those get melted olive oil can go in without being melted as long as you have melted oils you're adding in so at room temperature olive oil we have our water then our vitamin E and our glycerine our stearic acid our emulsified wax our preservative that goes in at a hundred and forty degrees so I wrote preservative 140 and essential oils that go in at one hundred and sixty degrees so I wrote essential oils one hundred and sixty just as a reminder for y'all guys and then we have here it shows you though that we have managed to put in enough numbers to make it all the way to a hundred you can add notes as into what essential oils you added or any of the cooking or tips so that you who excuse me to remember all right so we have our shea butter at 4% this is a light day cream you would increase the oils and decrease the water to make this a heavier lotion so we have 4% shea butter we have 2% coconut oil and we have 2% olive oil well let's say you'd like to add avocado right avocado right here and take a point from your olive oil since it's a liquid oil and add it right here so then you'd have 1% avocado and 1% olive oil on your water it's 75 point 4 excuse me 75 point four so the reason we do that is because on our vitamin E we have point three and our glycerine we have point three that equals up under the ounces category at being point three on your scales now if you would like to decrease the vitamin E or increase the glycerin or vice versa you would make sure you put your point in or you're going to end up with a whole one percent which is too much do your point here change it and then just decrease or add to the point four on the water remember we are adding slightly more water whoo excuse me slightly more water than it's called for because of evaporation just a little bit all right so then we're going on down to our stearic acid we're at 2% and our emulsifying wax we're at 9% now let me discuss that with you every company has a different percentage of emulsifying wax required to emulsified oils so I buy mine from Soper's choice if I use cocoa butter sometimes I have to increase it to 10% so but I know that I have seen on I think Brambleberry an emulsifying wax that it only required I think four percent to emulsify oils so you know yeah I might be wrong oh that it's been a long time but I do know that different companies have different you know how much is required to be used to emulsify your oils remember your step to wait and watch for floating oils to rise to the top that did not get emulsified blend well in case you didn't blend well good enough the first place if it happens again that they float up add more emulsifying wax while it is hot your preservative one percent I do not know of a preservative out there that requires more than 1% and some of them only require a half a percent but you will find a lot of wishy-washy answers as to how much preservative you can you should use on a particular price they'll say well it depends on your recipe it depends on your recipe I found that 1% always makes me happy and always takes care of everything alright on essential oils 160 I have put this in at 4% 4% is safe for everybody but children I pregnant women so if you wish to use 2% it's considered safe for children and for women depending of course then 2 on the type of essential oil you use if you add peppermint of course we're not going to put that on babies or fragile skin or you know blah blah blah especially you know 4% peppermint would be too much too you've got to limit that that's just too much of a irritate a skin irritant same thing you don't put citrus essentials in here lemongrass is not a citrus my favorite ones is rosemary lemongrass lavender and tea tree that's my favorite ones in lotion and I add more lavender than I do lemongrass I just a little bit of lemongrass and because lemongrass is over what overwhelming rosemary is about a middle of the road it's not as not as weak in scent as lavender when it comes to sticking in your lotion but it's no strong live aggress lemongrass is very overwhelming and will overtake the smell of your soap tea tea tree can only be put in at 1% in a lotion because that's all that's safe if a person rubs it over their entire body and a lotion is meant to rub on the entire body and even if you're selling it as a facial lotion people might rub it all over them so stick to 1% unless you want to put warnings on your labels all right so 1% is all that safe for tea tree for something you're going to rub all over your body ok so we've got 4 percent 1 percent 9 percent 2 percent point 3 point 3 7 point 4 - 2 & 4 now if we wanted to make this a night cream a heavier cream we would double the oils and reduce the water air we could also double the vitamin E double the glycerin but the rest of this would pretty much stay the same ok but this here now and on this on your lavender at 4% you can add a touch more lavender it's one of the most benign essential oils even if you're doing 2% you can go over a little bit you know with lavender okay so anyway so now how do we get these things to work because if I sit and take out my batch size volume and hit calculate look at all the zeros well let's say you want to make a 4 ounce tester bottle hit 4 and hit calculate and then you're gonna want to do it in grams because it's so tiny okay so there you can do a 4 ounce tester jar all right well let's say you want to do 25 for hours jars that would be a hundred ounces and you click calculate and there you go we've got 4 ounces of shea butter 2 ounces of coconut oil 2 ounces of olive oil seventy five point four ounces of water point three ounces of vitamin E and glycerine two ounces of stearic acid nine ounces of emulsifying wax one ounce of preservative and 4 ounces of essential all so there you go that's how you do it that's how you do it now uh-huh so now let's just take that and let's print it let me see there's a button for that print recipe and we got everything here where does the prop print this page it's not easy you got to go through a couple steps and hit print and there you go all right now if you just want to do you know four four ounce jars four eight twelve sixteen you could do 16 ounces calculate you see you just tell it how much you want debt what if you want to do this in pounds mark it over here in pounds but now it's gonna do 16 pounds you say and then there it is but I like the fact that you can look at it how much it needs to be how much you need announces pounds milliliters and Gramps because sometimes like let's do this here 100 oh I've lost my screen let's say I'm doing 56 ounces let's see if we can get some barriers calculate okay two point six nine well I'm just gonna bump it up to two point seven you see six 675 ounces I'm still on pounds point fifty-eight well I'm going to do point six you know I just I just try to even it out to what the scale would do when it's just too much of a variance then I look at the grams and I do grams for that one okay so there you go we'll put that back on ounces back on 100 I'm gonna hit calculate and there you go there's our recipe and I'm gonna take and and scan this for you and let you look at it", "E15C1PhSIP4": "[Music] hi welcome to hemp lucid University my name is Nick Van y and I'm gonna count strategist here at hemp lucid today I want to talk to you a little bit about whole plants CBD hemp loosens whole plant CBD there's a full spectrum

thank you you", "BBCDrNDF_N8": "matches my eyes hey guys and welcome to another ready review I'm Matt and this week we're gonna be reviewing hemp daddy's therapeutic hemp extract hemp daddies hip extract is a full-spectrum CBD oil which essentially means that it helps alleviate inflammation depression anxiety and helps with sleep so this is gonna be a little bit of a different review especially since this is CBD oil it's more of a supplement than it is actual gear so it's kind of different to gauge and I will give you my experience as best I can put it before working with hemp daddy truth be told I did not know a ton about CBD oil and its effects how it can help as a supplement but we had a chance to sit down with caleb simpson founder of hemp daddies he does go into full detail on the benefits of CBD oil and specifically how he himself came across it in his podcast episode of the reddy 80 podcast I highly recommend it we will link it up in the description below I had the chance to use this for about two weeks I was a little skeptical because this kind of stuff is something that I'm obviously haven't really used before especially CBD oil but I have to say has really helped with at least sleep that is the most immediate thing I've recognized I do feel a little less anxiety obviously we're up in Vermont so we're doing this big promotion there's been a ton of work as fun it has been and it is great it has been to kind of see the different mountains and just enjoy my time back in Vermont having the CBD oil to try out and get acclimated with and help alleviate some of my stress has been really really nice I would say that with this type of thing you might want to consult a doctor if you're thinking about getting CBD oil as a supplement keep in mind that it may affect different people different ways I don't think that I felt a very very distinct change but I just noticed certain patterns in my sleeping and just my stress level that I really do think this can be attributed to I did use the hemp extract twice daily for about two weeks I will say that it's kind of strange just drinking oil or ingesting oil but the mint flavor really does help to make it a little bit more enjoyable and it does taste like real mint it doesn't taste artificial or anything so it wasn't bad at all to take tailee in some cases I looked forward to it because it just makes your breath a little fresher if you get the mint flavor if you're someone who struggled with sleep or anxiety I would definitely recommend checking out hemp daddies I think it's really done a lot to help me out in the past two weeks and it could potentially help you out they do have a ton of information about CBD if you want to educate yourself and just get a little bit more acclimated to how it works I would definitely recommend that as well especially just jumping into anything new that you know might alter your brain chemistry or something like that obviously you're gonna want to read up on it they do have other CBD infused products they have capsules as well as a topical cream in addition to the hemp extract the topical cream is more for obviously like

we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "14_66pYuQbU": "all right everyone let's talk about anxiety and depression okay two of my favorite topics now we'll also be talking about CBD which has become one of my all-time favorite topics specifically we're gonna be talking about finding the right dosage of CBD for anxiety now if you follow my channel you know that I have battled depression and anxiety for years really for most of my adult life and I've been on different antidepressants and none of them has really worked as well as I wanted them to and the side effects were pretty bad as well now that all changed when I started taking CBD now I get a lot of questions about again I become a big evangelical for CBD I think it's it's great it has really helped my anxiety and depression now I still have days that are a little you know a little touch-and-go but nothing nearly as bad as as before you guys know last year I got 5150 I was in a horrid relationship but that's all beside the point so what I want to get to is you know what's what what dosage should you take I get that that question a lot from people that know I started I've been taking CBD now when I first started out I just I just had the vape pen so it was really difficult for me to to determine you know how much I was actually taking I just kind of took it as I needed it and I remember to take it probably about I don't know maybe 20 20 hits a day something like that maybe less than that but someone that I'd say 1500 15 but again I really had no idea you know no way of really determining what dosage I was I was taking so then I started getting the tincture and this has really changed everything for me so one of these droppers is 15 milligrams so I take one in the morning I put under your tongue two in the morning one in the afternoon and then one night and then during the day I hit the vape pen so that's what 3045 probably about 55 60 milligrams a day and that seems to work for me now when I was looking at at some of the studies that some of the research they recommended 150 milligrams so when it comes to anxiety you know the CBD dosage has a what they call an inverted u right so the lower dosage has more more of an effect on on anxiety the lower and mid doses have more of an effect on anxiety than the higher doses right so you got that kind of bell curve so the farther you go out the higher the doses the less effect it has on your anxiety now having said that the studies that I saw they looked at people who were just about to give a speech right so public speaking is one of the the biggest fears that that most people have right I don't I'm not okay with that obviously no I think that's that's a really specific anxiety and that's why I think that doses were so high 150 milligrams now my anxiety is much more generalized right as kind of this impending sense of doom as it were I mean it kind of stays with me the whole the whole day so for me around like I said 60 55 seems to be the optimal dosage now we get to this what the research is called the Goldilocks and so on right so everybody's got to kind of find out what their dosage is you know you know not too much not too little but just right now I think starting at at 50 milligrams per day it's a good place to start you know try that for you know a week or two see how you feel and if you need more you know up the dosage but if you need less obviously you know scale it down because here's the thing it's just expensive you know this little vape cartridge was 38 dollars I think with tax so some of the bigger bottles of the tincture are anywhere from eighty to you know one hundred and some odd dollars so you had to be you know as economical with it as possible that's why I recommend you know starting at a lower dose and kind of working your way up I do have a free trial I found a company that will send you a free two week trial at this size of bottle all you got to do is pay for shipping I think it's like seven bucks 695 $6.99 something like that so I'll put a link in the description below you guys could take a you know get a ball for free newspaper shipping try it out and see if it works for for your anxiety it has worked for mine as works my depression I am thoroughly amazed at how well it works and if you go back and look at some of my old videos on this channel you will see that I was a mental emotional wreck last year you know I wasn't always the put together suave gentleman you see before you now but if you look back at some of those old videos man who I was going through it let me tell you and this has really helped immensely I can't I can't praise it enough so again start out with like 50 milligrams I wouldn't go over a hundred and fifty in the day you know space it out morning noon and night and you should be you should be fine now the reason I take the the vape in the most is because when you vape CBD oil it gets in your system faster so there any times I feel kind of anxious or you know maybe a little down I'll hit this and within a few minutes you know that that feeling of dread that feeling of anxiety that feeling of sadness you know definitely goes down so taking the tincture takes a while to work they say up to two hours but normally it's like maybe 30 minutes now 40 minutes max but uh yeah so I use a combination of both you know do whatever I can to uh feel better you know I want to get this this anxiety and this depression under control because it was really ruining my life last year my my life was just constantly burning to the ground and I could not deal with with anything you know I said I was in a bad relationship I was trying to get sober I was you know trying to start a whole new business and there was just more and more pressure and stress and anxiety and it got it got really bad up to the point where again I said you said I got 5150 so Wow it's kind of hard to you wouldn't even talk about but yeah I'm past all that like I said I feel better and I don't want to say owe it all to to CBD but this has definitely helped immensely the first time I took it I felt better within you know maybe half an hour 45 minutes so if you're suffering from anxiety from depression any kind of you know mental or emotional illness I really highly recommend taking that taking CBD just to see how it works I think you'll be you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results again you get a bottle like this for about seven bucks to pay the shipping and yeah it's good stuff so that's all I got for today I'll be back with some more CBD themed videos here shortly like and share this video subscribe to the channel and I will see you guys later", "8gBX5sbaa3Q": "woohoo first 45 mile week in a long time that's what i'm talking about i even got a peek day in and seriously it would not be possible without this [Music] hey y'all welcome back to biz live i'm vivian camille and today we are talking about hemp daddy's transdermal cbd cream this stuff right here is no joke i am not kidding when i say this has been the difference between me going out for a run and me not going for a run um with how effective it has been for me cbd was not something on my radar i really was not comfortable ingesting it so when caleb who is the owner and founder of this company reached out to me i said you know i'll give the cream a try and see how that is and i'm really thankful i did because like i said this has been the difference between me going for a run and me not being able to finish my run due to my knee and hip injuries and so this pretty much just like alleviates the pain and allows me to push through those runs i think it's a combination of this cream and just my body healing itself but i know that this makes a big difference caleb sent this to me for free in return i make a review video um however i didn't feel comfortable making a full review video based off of one cbd experience so i've tried two or three others to get a better idea of how topical cbd works and to better review this one and compare it to kind of the others i tried one that had like magnesium in it and like a cooling cream in it and it was good it worked well but it just it like ran down my knees there was like dripping wetness that would run down my knees as i ran and i didn't like that that was really uncomfortable another one i tried was a little cream that went on and it didn't work at all i didn't see any difference when i went running and the third one i tried was also a cream of sorts the first one that magnesium one was a roll-on kind of one but the third cream i tried it worked all right but it was like a lotion and again it like it stayed on top of my skin so when i started sweating when i ran it began to sweat off it didn't drip as bad as the roll-on magnesium one but it was like a lotion and if you've ever run with lotion on in the sun in the summer in tucson that's like the worst feeling on the planet i didn't know there was such a wide spectrum of cbd this one is the best i've found or i guess i could say this is the best one that found me um i met caleb at band at the bandera 100k and he kind of introduced me to his cbd company i figured out that it's all organic and it is tested by a third party to make sure that everything is consistent and the batches are all the same if you don't know a whole lot about cbd and are considering whether or not it could be a good thing for you he has a youtube channel i think it's called hemp daddy's i'll link that down below you can check out and he's got some really good informational videos that kind of explain it explain what it does explain the process and what have you so this hemp daddy transdermal cream the reason that it rises above all the others is number one because it actually works the first and foremost thing that i love about this is that it actually absorbs into my skin the importance of that is number one i don't feel like i have a second layer of skin on me my knee which has the cbd on it right now and my shin which doesn't they feel almost identical it's not like a gross layer there's no fragrance to this there's no dye in this there's no added anything it's just the cream and it absorbs really well the second reason why that's important is because it actually works some of the other creams i tried didn't really work at all this i put on about five to ten minutes before i go out on a run and within that time this stuff is jiving i mean i start like i am able to run and i think it lasts i'd say probably two hours on some of my long runs i've brought it with me and reapplied um but it works really well it works quickly and it absorbs into the skin there is 10 milligrams of cbd per pump this is the extra strength it's called extra strength for a reason it works i'll show you what you get in one pump you get that much sumo so i usually do one pump for both of my knees and then i kind of spread it out to the back of my legs um and then i do one pump for my hip to make sure that i am covered and that i don't have any problems um a lot of people use this for recovery after their run and they've said that it's helped them with their recovery but um i kind of use it as liquid gold and so i just use it on my run so that i can make sure i get through that run another reason why this is such a good product is that there are two ingredients in it lipoderm and hemp extract and hemp extract is number one there's about 60 servings in here i've been very disappointed with the other cbd i tried so if you know a product works then you stick with it so i am very very excited to share this product with you if you want a discount i will link a code down below and you're welcome to use that do your own research always um this is my review this is my experience with the cbd i would tell anyone who's comfortable using it to use this one because it actually works and it's third party sourced and it's organic and it's from colorado hand-picked family farm and those are all reasons why i would support this product and i'm endorsing it now but like i said do your own research try out different cbd figure out the one that works best for you but if you're interested in this one you can check that out with a link down below thank y'all so much for watching really appreciate it thank you for supporting my channel please like this video and subscribe if you're interested in more fun videos they're not all review videos but when i find something i like i enjoy sharing it so yeah

we could see if we could make that happen okay can't wait to see that list [Laughter] yes you", "Gu-fdHzzoc0": "hi everyone this is Judy Murray and today as promised I wanted to share a little bit about my experience so far with my brand-new hem fat and the South Devon defined self that has CBD oil in them so here's um the hemp app and I'm sure you've seen it around and it heats up pretty quick and so it's pretty simple to use comes fully loaded comes with two different containers full of the oil and also a USB charger so that's pretty cool I'm sure it's much like many of the others that are out there and it's really the product that I'm testing and also here's the south and you can see it's pretty green smells okay smells a little bit medicinal but still pretty good so these came last night and we my husband and I immediately began to test them and before we started using the product we both checked in with ourselves to see where we were cautiously and physically if we had any aches or pains or anything like that going on and then we each tried by taking a couple of hits off of the that pen and I'm not exactly sure if it's supposed to be called a hit or not but we inhaled a couple times I didn't notice anything really immediately although I did feel sensations in the brain and nothing much pretty much anywhere else in the body Stephen however had more of an immediate reaction to it which doesn't surprise me because his metabolism is so much faster than mine so he immediately said wow I love this I really like the sensation of well being that I'm getting i really like that in fact he liked it so much he asked if he could sign up under me and purchase his own hemp app which is pretty fun because I knew he would want his own anyways so I'm glad he did we took care of that then i had a couple of calls to make in a conference and we had we did a mini bio meditation session and our usual things that we do and then later on what I was feeling tired but it was really too early to go to bed it was probably about 7 30 and I noticed I was yawning and feeling a little cloudy headed so I decided to try it again and I did two separate sessions where I inhaled and I obviously don't take a really big inhale but a good-sized one and learn to heat learn to hold it and then probably after the second second inhalation that is when I really noticed the sense of well-being and just being at peace and a lot more clarity and I was no longer tired so I think that was pretty awesome and and that was the end of it for that last night you", "fs4YpfxgblI": "Well, Buenos dias from San Felipe Mexico\nguys! Hope you're having a great day. It's Sunday for us.We just enjoyed a nice\nbreakfast here at Vintage cafe and crepas.. And... Not bad at all! Pretty darn good!...So here's the interesting thing...I really have no idea what we're gonna vlog about\ntoday. Do you have any ideas? Just life I guess. And see what happens...Let's see what the brings...We're good at that!... Well somebody needs a haircut\nand we bought this here at the bodega. And there wasn't a price on the shelf. So....\nI ended up paying like twenty-five dollars for this. I was thinking it might be like ten. Even\nthough we have some at Beck's mom's house. We thought... Yeah! Let's give her a\nhaircut here. The interesting thing is going to be seeing how the return process\nworks. I do have a receipt. Okay! well it looks like we're just gonna get in-house\ncredit! And yeah.... 20, 25 bucks no big deal! Because we do come to this Bodega quite\noften. Because they have a little bit of everything here. You know a lot of the\nstuff in this store is a.... Looks like it comes from Walmart. They have\neverything from scooters, washing machines and I think a great value is\nlike a Walmart brand. This is something quite fascinating! Every time an employee\nbuys something like a pack of gum or a drink, they scored it with a shot a\nspray-paint. I guess it's an effective way to secure your inventory. Well concerns have been expressed that\nthe toilet paper we bought last time is a bit rough. And this is the stuff we got\nfor twenty one pesos. And I have no idea what is gonna be better unless I use\nprice as like a factor. I don't know! This stuff is ahhh.... 20 peso! Sometimes you just have to live on the edge when it comes to toilet paper. I really would like to\ncheck this place out...They look closed because it's Sunday...Volunteers without limits! We spend enough time here that we would like to do some volunteer work and sometimes it can be tough\nfinding out where to. But we were referred to this place but... It's Sunday\nand they're not open! We'll have to come back. Look at all those motorcycles...Wow! Beautiful motorcycles to. You know this place is always busy. We\nneed to eat here one day. I'm like totally not hungry now but they're\nalways busy..... Good stuff! Guys this is a really.... Thank you for shaking on me!... Nice day here in San Felipe and the dogs need to get out and play.\nShelby, she's just gonna sand bathe. The dynamic between these dogs is pretty funny because the Springer, Gabe he loves to swim. The Border Collie Sichael, he will\nonly go out about to his chest. And then he gets all jealous that the puppies are\nout there. And just.... It's just a big game with these dogs!\nAnd then Shelby just likes hanging out on the beach. So this is all just a\nlittle bit of hearsay from, I think it was like Victor and Lily. But I guess at\none point they were anticipating cruise ships coming to San Felipe.So.... Some of\nthese ahhhh... Kind of more resort skyscraper looking buildings were developed and\nthen it got canceled out. So.... There's a lot of half-finished hotels. I,  It's like\na double-edged sword you know! You think it would be great for the economy for some cruise ships to come in. But yet it would change the whole dynamic of the town and probably take away some of the charm! Well we're gonna round this afternoon\nout with a trip to the sweet spot.They're not always open but Monica yesterday\nsaid that they have really good margaritas! You guys are a salt on the rim type of\nperson or a no salt? I just love that contrast with the salt... Well you gotta get a little sampler platter to soak up the alcohol. This little dog\nis getting mighty hungry right now! She's taking a couple whips off just in the\nhopes that she'll get some food. I am so glad we ordered a little bit of food...\nBecause these guys, they snuck some alcohol into that picture Margherita's!...Oh oh! Mom's intoxicated! Fortunately grandma had some dog food in her trunk. We attained the monster! Mom what are you doing ordering a whole slab of ribs?...That's what we are having for dinner....We are hungry! Seriously this has to be the best\nhomemade potato salad I've had in a long time! I think mom just didn't want us\ndriving intoxicated. So she knew we had to like soak up the alcohol! Wow! And we also just totally hung out with\nVincent the chef here...He's awesome...Yeah....The Sweet Spot.... Worth your ahhhh... Stop here in San Felipe! Alright guys! I got to give you a shout-out on my youtube channel because this food is great! We have Vincent.... What's happening?....DeAndre!...\nDeAndre... Quincy and this is the guy that adds tequila to those margaritas.\nHey! Great meal guys! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you for coming...You gotta love leftovers...I like the oranges...And grandma wants the oranges. I'm not safe to drive right now! That CBD oil must\nreally be giving her the munchies. Because.... Shelby has not let up.She is\nwanting all of what we are having... Our dog is a weed freak!...There's worse things to be in life.... But on\na very serious note! We have started Shelby be on CBD oil. Which is the\nnon-intoxicating, anti inflammatory aspect of hemp or marijuana whatever...And she has like an autoimmune condition with her spinal cord where it's all\ninflamed. And it has just been amazing! We've seen this burst of life come back\nto her personality! Like she's getting into shit and stirring up trouble. That's\nthe Shelby we know and love!...Like before she wouldn't be stirring stuff up! Like\nit really warms our heart to know that this CBDoil D oil... CBD oil is really\nhelping her. And if you guys have a dog with some type of an issue related to\ninflammation, I would highly recommend giving it a shot! And you can get it in\nall 50 states guys.... I think we found our designated driver! Ah Sitka, He's a good boy! Well, when the music is good and the\nseats are comfortable and the margaritas taste good.... There's just no reason to go\nhome! So.... We're gonna finish out here for the\nday. But be sure to hit that subscribe button because I'm sure we're gonna be\nup to something fun tomorrow! And....Thanks for joining us!

I've had so many people say there showed up today so I want to take a minute and show you how to use it and what to expect because I know so many of you are gonna be having questions so this is the one ounce bottle that you have received today tomorrow sometime this week if you order and I want to show you how I take my hemp oil every single night what I do why I do it and and give you a little bit of what to expect all right so super easy I'm gonna keep this short either you ordered the full spectrum like this or the isolate and in it you are this is the bottle that I've been using for the last couple of weeks in it you're gonna have a dropper and it goes to one milliliter okay so you're just gonna go ahead and if you just give it one full suck it usually fills mine to 0.75 the first month that I used my oil I only used a half of a dropper the reason why is because number one so I use just a half of the dropper the reason why is because number one I didn't know how long it was gonna be before I could get another bottle and so I wanted to like conserve it and make it last and I had also heard that you can have some detox symptoms with it and to start slow so I thought okay that's fine so I messaged my friend who was really really knowledgeable about hemp and I said you know what happens to me if I use the full dropper like what's gonna happen to me and she's like nothing nothing's gonna happen to you use the full dropper so the only reason why I really we used the only the half a drop of the hemp oil to start was because I was trying to conserve it because I didn't know how long it was gonna be and I wanted to make it last for a full month so the benefit though of doing it that way is I did have some detox okay the detox that I had was exhaustion I was completely exhausted for a couple of weeks I remember just like in the afternoon sleeping all night and being so tired and I will link the call that Jamie Foote did for us last week on our leaders retreat team call so that you can hear why that happened why it's a good thing and I just took naps you guys it's your body basically coming back into homeostasis and healing itself so I've been through detox before it was an enjoyable detox it was not uncomfortable it wasn't bad I mean you just drink an active or take them ed a burn or take a nap all those things are gonna work great so I'm gonna show you now you can start off at a half a dropper and after a week if you're feeling great go up to a full dropper I am up to a full dropper now and and you'll you'll be able to just navigate this and it's just something new but it's nothing to be afraid of it's not like normal detox where you're gonna be sick none of that I just had extreme fatigue as part of my detox so I don't want anyone to be nervous or scared like start with the full dropper but I just thought I'd share with you what I did and what I experienced in case you have that too Sean is gonna start his tonight because we've got three fresh bottles he's gonna finally get to try it and then I also got the isolate for Mackenzie so I'm gonna give her I'm probably gonna start her off on a quarter full like a little quarter of a dropper or maybe even half a dropper and I'm hoping that it really helps her with her anxiety so more on that later but I'm gonna show you how to take it so this is just a half dropper because I'm gonna take another Huff dropper again tonight I thought I'd show you what it looks like to just take a half drop right now so what I want you to do is I want you to put up under your tongue and then I want you to hold it there under your tongue for nine seconds why do I want you to do this because that is how it's going to absorb most efficiently into your body its fat soluble so the fat is actually gonna make it so that it's absorbing more efficiently anyway but you want to hold it under the tongue for 90 seconds now I don't sit and count to 90 in my head what I do is after I've brushed my teeth I I'm in my jammies I go to my bedside table I just keep it inside of my little sock drawer and I pull it out I put my chapstick on I put half of it I put a full dropper and I do a full dropper but I put a full dropper under my tongue all right and then I walk around my house I make sure all the lights are off again I'm just holding it under my tongue this whole time I turn off all the lights in my house I set my alarm on my I set my house alarm I go downstairs I check on the kids and then I come upstairs and by the time I get back upstairs and I get in bed I figure that had to have been 90 seconds and then I just swallow it at that point the full spectrum tastes like berry guava I think the isolate is like a mint but I'll let you know because it's coming today still I had that one shipped to my mom's house because I got on her account so I'm gonna show you now what to do and how to do it and I want you to do this at bedtime if you're someone who who wants to use this if you're like CrossFit and like super into exercise and fitness and weightlifting and all of that I want to know what your experience is with the hemp oil if you take it right before your workout because I've heard that the MCT oil inside of this those are multi chain triglycerides I've heard that it can help with workouts so for those of you that are like really inch bodybuilding or CrossFit or things like that I would love to know if you notice the difference but I just take mine at bedtime so just do just tell us all the things and how it goes for you because this is also new for us okay so this is what you do under your tongue but uh uh and uh hum well ninety Saturn's okay Oh it's like who's people under your tongue for like 90 seconds Brennan you're gonna hold it under your tongue for 90 seconds don't talk to anyone like don't do what I'm doing right now again this is why I do it right at bedtime at night who's gonna hold it under your tongue and then after you hold it under your tongue for 90 seconds you're gonna swallow it and then you're gonna go to sleep you're gonna have the best sleep of your whole entire life it's gonna be life-changing like I'm gonna swallow now just because I want to build talk normal to you guys what the the best way that I can describe the sleep that I have with my oil is I feel like I sink down into my mattress halfway and a cocoon closes up over me and I don't move until I wake up the next morning like I thought my sleep was good before this hello it's amazing so super excited for you guys cannot wait for you to drive it out cuz I know everybody's oil is coming today these are my three bottles that I ordered on my account chanson count my reentry account then I ordered one on my mom's account too so and I got the isolate on my mom's account so I'll let you know how that goes I'm gonna just easy not with Mackenzie I want the full spectrum for myself and and I just wanted to buy a nice alit and see how that goes and I'm gonna I'll try it too I want to see what it tastes like but um make sure that whatever results you're having with this post them here in the team page even if you're like oh my gosh can it do that can it work that fast yes it can yes it can and I want to document all of it in our team page so that we have a wide variety things for people to just just showcase everybody's different experiences with it if you remember too when you put your story in there use hashtag CBD hashtag hemp so that we can find all of these stories really easily all right guys Callie Tara goes

oil back bombs so bath bombs with CBD oil are very relaxing even people that don't have pain issues or whatever really enjoy using them so let's get started what we're gonna do first is use this big bowl I like it to be a little bit flat just so I can reach better when I'm actually shaping the balls and you're gonna need this strainer I like to use a metal one I find the plastic ones break pretty easily on me to wait so we're gonna start off by running our dry ingredients right through this just so that there's no lumps and bumps that we have to get out later on it's just kind of a pain in the butt and that way we have good consistent back bombs so we're gonna start out by adding 2 cups of baking soda and we're just gonna run that right through use your hands it's not a big deal I always wear gloves I find the citric acid it's a little bit hard on my hands and just run that through get all the lumps through add your next ingredient so the next thing we're going to add is a cup of citric acid and this one is almost this consistency of like a fine salt so it does take sometimes a little more work to get it through the strainer but it gets through there and it's worth it in the end as you can see there's quite a few bumps and lumps and stuff in there so you want to make sure we get all that out and you meup with bumps at the end you can run as much of it through as you can if you have any leftovers you can throw them out but for the most part we've got all of it here so now we have other ingredients that aren't going to require the strainer but we have one more to do first and that is a quarter cup of every room powder obviously I buy it in large quantities because I make a lot of these but I have some linked because we're gonna run this through there now so all our dry ingredients are in here we're going to give them a good mix together and then we're going to add in a quarter cup of salt so the salt you can use is you can use Epsom salts you can use pink Himalayan sea salt you can use regular sea salt you can use dead sea salt sometimes the dead sea salt comes in pretty big granules and it kind of looks pretty but it's a little harder to get your hands on today I'm going to use fine pink Himalayan sea salt you can use this in your food too which is nice less sodium so we're gonna take that mix it around now if we weren't putting any color at all into these bath bombs they would it would be really pretty having this pink sea salt in here I don't know if you can really see it's got you can see all the little pink crystals in there but we're gonna add some color the air so I'm going to use this color I got from crazy colors it's a little tiny when I wasn't sure on the color so I just ordered a little one but um this is the royal blue this is from crazy colors and they do a very good job with their color it now color is really up to you you can use as much or as little as you want I don't think you need to go to bananas I'm going to use just shy of a half a teaspoon and we'll see how that looks they're very very concentrated so you generally don't need to use a whole lot which is nice so we're gonna just mix this all together it does look like a very pretty color it's gonna actually get a little bit darker once we wet put our wet ingredients in so you're just gonna mix this around until you don't see any white powder anymore just then we know that it's well mixed there we go okay so now we're gonna add our wet ingredients which would be CBD oil and scent so what I did I wanted something a little bit more earthy so I used a half of a tablespoon of patchouli oil and I used a half a tablespoon of sandalwood and amber the other thing you're going to need is some high strength CBD oil when I make bath bombs I like a higher strength because you can't use a lot of oil or it's gonna ruin your bath bombs they won't set so I like to use a really high strain so that I can use a smaller amount of oil so I use two tablespoons of CBD oil in this one I don't recommend using any more than that unless of course you're making a recipe bigger if you double the recipe you can double your oils so I have two sandalwood and amber the patchouli and the CBD oil all mixed in this little cup so we're just gonna pour it in just like that get all that goodness out there we go alright and we're gonna mix this around now so we need to mix this really really well there cannot be anything that's not mixed so anywhere where those dry ingredients get your hands in there and give it a really good stir this is definitely a hands-on type of project you can use your mixer I use my mixer all the time but for the purposes of people that may not have a mixer especially a stand mixer I'm just gonna use my hands and it works just as well it just takes a little bit longer there we go so we've got that all mixed up this looks pretty good the consistency is not bad as you can see it's a little bit dry when I squeeze my hands together it should stick and it's kind of coming apart a little bit so we know that we're gonna need some witch hazel you can use a spray bottle that tends to work the best or you can use just put a little bit in a spoon and just slowly put it in I have I'm just gonna use one without a spray bottle on it so we're just gonna add this a little little bit at a time I've got a little spoon here I'm just gonna spoon it in the thing with witch hazel is that when it touches the solution you can see it's kind of starting to bubble a little bit so it's very important that you start stirring it right away because you don't want to activate your bath bombs before you get them in the backside of it so you put a little bit in as spritzer works fine usually that's actually how I do it but I also go through a lot of witch hazel so might have it big giant bottles all right so this consistency looks pretty good so what we're gonna do now is we're going to get our molds so these molds I use quite often I actually have a press as well but that's a whole other story so your bath bombs will be about this big so you drop in the tub it's not too much it's gonna smell lovely and if you get to go you can also use I don't know if you've seen them but you can use the plastic Christmas ornament balls and you can get them at Michael's or they have to sell them on Amazon as well I have links to everything you need to make these including the metal and the plastic bath bomb molds on the Canadian weed forum website so if you go there go to the recipe section every ingredient has a link to pick it up on Amazon that sometimes the easiest place to find all your ingredients some are harder to find that other citric acid I find a little bit hard at least in my area to find locally so it's much easier for me to order it from a distributor or in a smaller batch on Amazon so let's get started doing our bath bombs so we're just gonna take a bomb we're gonna squish it a little bit flat you don't go too tight but you want it to be overfilled okay then you're gonna take the other side and overfill that as well so now you take your two sides you squish them together give them a little bit of a twist when you hear them touching you know that it's nice and tight and closed so now we gotta get this thing out of here so what I do is I use a spoon I tap on my mold both sides not too hard dent your molds and there we go flip it over pop the top off and there you go you've got a beautiful CVD bath bomb and here we go now if you want to be really tidy about it you can clean your edges off as well so as you can see on these ones they've got a little bit of what's called they call it in a Saturn ring which is a little ring around it but you can take that off as well I like to keep it on I don't think it matters either way so but we'll make one this one I'll make it and we'll clean off the edges a little bit just so you can see a difference [Music] that top they're so getting your outside or your edge off it's pretty easy you just push on your edges and they'll either partially fall off or they'll just get stick right back into your backbone so you'll still have that Ridge there but that's okay it is a little bit neater looking this way so what you want to do too is just keep checking your consistency if you're finding that they're not sticking together as well then you're going to want to adjust and put a little bit more witch hazel in if you need to now if you don't want to order these molds you all certainly don't have to there's lots of things you can use as molds you can make your own you can make them look like pucks cut the bottom of a Pringles container up or something like that you can use muffin trays although if you're going to use muffin trays I do find it's a little bit harder to get them out so basically what you'll need to do is once they're made you're gonna just leave them in the mold you're gonna let them set and then you're gonna take them out of the mold flip them upside down tap on the bottoms lift up the tray and that will release your will ear balls for you well I guess they would be more like pucks wouldn't they all right there will clean these edges again just so you can see what I'm doing here all I'm really doing is I'm just pressing really lately on this outside edge that just cleans it out just a little bit there [Music] perfect here we go so we got seven bombs out of this recipe but like I said you can double it triple it as much as you want if you're making a really big batch though you're gonna really need to keep your eye on the consistency you want to make sure that when you squeeze it and you pull your hand away that fat piece sticks together once you start finding that it's starting to fall apart a little bit more witch hazel and you do that any time it's not a problem at all and then you can make as many as you want so the other thing you can do is play with color or split your mixture in half you can do half white half blue or half pink and half green or whatever you like the possibilities are endless you can split your batch once you've made it before you add your color you can just split your mix into as many bowls as you want and add a little bit of color into each each about them and they look really pretty when they're done so what we'll do next is we're gonna leave these bombs to sit overnight 12 hours is about all you need if it's a little bit humid in your area today our weather is it looks like it's going to be a little bit rainy today so what I'll probably do is we'll put a fan on them just to keep them drying very nicely otherwise they take a lot longer to set if it's humid outside or if it's wet or damp so we'll put a fan on them we'll leave them overnight and then wrap them up and give them to our friends or keep them for ourselves or put them in the bathroom so to wrap them is very easy the easiest way to do it is to put them in some plastic wrap just wrap them up or you can put them by some pretty little candy bags at a dollar store they're very cheap I think you get I don't know 20 of them or something for a dollar and you can just wrap them up and tie up the tops and give away as presents especially Christmas coming it's a good opportunity to get some stuff made for people stockings so what we'll do now is I will go fill this bottle and we'll try one of these bath bombs just you can get an idea of what it looks like when it's they're all done in when they're in your tub so buddy I don't have a tub here so we're gonna use this big bowl I'll fill it with water and we'll drop one about bombs in and see how it looks all right so let's drop one of these bath bombs in look how pretty [Music] look at that disappeared so the water is a beautiful color it looks super nice you can see some of the oils a little bit sitting on top there are ingredients you can add if you want that to dissipate you would add an ingredient called polysorbate 80 that's a little harder to get your hands on if you need to just message me in the on the website in the recipe section and I will send you a link to buy it if you need to but all in all you're sitting in the tub you've got beautiful blue water you've got lots of the CBD oil we're just going to make you feel phenomenal you can't ask for much more than that alright so you got to see how we made the bath bombs you see how love out there when you're fit when you're finished with them technically you can use these right away but you do want them to be a little bit harder because otherwise they'll get a little bit denty and they won't look so pretty but if you are dying to have a bath and you want to try these out and you make them and you haven't let them sit that's totally okay if you use them for yourself go ahead and throw it in the tub and enjoy your soak and if not let them sit overnight they should have a pretty hard consistency when they're ready to go and you know wrap them up give them to friends saving for later whatever you like to do store them in a fairly dry area if you can it is they will keep a little bit longer if you rock them up even if you're keeping them for yourself wrap them up in a bag wrap in a zip wrap them up in some saran wrap whatever works for you but wrap them up keep the moisture off of them keep the moisture away from them Stormin mason jars I'm sure you've got lots of those around and if not throw them on the table and enjoy you're soaked thank you again for watching this episode of martinis cannabis kitchen and we hope to see you next time if

it's going on here to tell you a little bit about a product that I recently purchased online it's called hemp oil by pure green labs I have a lot of issues like falling asleep and soft so I was looking for products to help with that well naturally because I've tried like Advil PM's and ibuprofen PM and stuff like that and nothing really seems to help be helping me and in fact they felt like they were doing more harm than good because these products just would make me feel groggy the next day and I really don't like to take any kind of tell us that our medication or anything like that I try to just do the long natural thing if I can I've even tried melatonin and that didn't work out so well with me so I'm like why not give this a try so far I've had a really positive expect is organic and GMO free it's a full spectrum hemp oil and it's 1,500 milligrams and this one is see how many oz one ounce 30 milliliters has ah the supplement fact in the back so serving sizes one dropper so that would be 30 drops there's 30 servings per bottle for only 4 calories and a serving so that's literally nothing ingredients pure cold-pressed full spectrum hemp oil 1500 milligrams of cannabis sativa based on a 2,000 calorie diet these statements have not been evaluated by the FDA this product is a dietary supplement and is not intended to diagnose treat her or prevent any disease so a few things I was I did read up a little bit on hemp oil before I purchased the product of course of course my main thing like I had brought up in the beginning and that I definitely have issues sleeping and it does affect my mood I'm a pretty laid-back person for the most part and I still am but I would get like blog I just hate being tired it just changes your whole day it makes you feel you know usually I'd be like I'm so excited to do something and like when you wake up and it's like it just feels more like a chore to do anything so it's just like I'd rather just like stay in bed today but they can't I would sometimes go through moods like that which was really hard on me and it was mainly just because I was tired and for no reason other than the fact that I didn't sleep the night before so that was something that was becoming really really hard on me but there are other great things about hemp oil that it could do for you if you don't have issues sleeping for example a little bit about the product it's good for pain relief cannabis sativa has been shown to promote pean relief and help manage chronic pain you may be experiencing and is done through an all-natural method it's good for anxiety and stress relief hemp oil has the added benefit of helping manage your anxiety and stress allowing you to feel calmer and more relaxed it helps you sleep if you have trouble falling asleep you're not alone hemp oil has been shown to dramatically improve your mood and ability to fall asleep and stay asleep which I have to say I've been taking us about thirty minutes before I go to sleep at night and it's certainly been helping with that and I haven't been taking any ibuprofen TM or anything like that anymore it's organic and GMO free some companies like to add cake sugar and preservatives to their hemp oil not this one they provide 100% natural hemp oil and its purest form and it is made in the USA they're cold-pressed have oil made from cannabis sativa is made and manufactured in the USA for the freshest and highest potency hemp oil so it's erections one full draw for 30 drops under tongue for 30 to 60 seconds before swallowing and may be used up to twice per day and then again has been non-gmo Livan THC free made in USA and manufactured for extreme Nutrition LLC Albany New York so I'm just gonna unscrew this and I want to show you guys what it looks like Oh another thing I just wanted to add like a first when I first tried it I was like and like the taste isn't great it's like it's hemp oil so it's not like I'm not expecting it to have a great flavor anything like that are you having a hard time doing this just one hand wavers really not not it's not horrible but it's just it's not great it doesn't taste great I don't really know how to explain to you what it tastes like but it's like and it's not the worst thing you have in the world I mean I've had medicine that tasted a lot worse so that's probably the worst of it but yeah you put like one of these because you would put a full dropper look at this amount the size you could squeeze it under your tongue leave it there for 30 to 60 seconds see it's like a yellowish color and so you drop it in under your tongue like that after a 60 seconds you could swallow it I'm not really sure the reason we're leaving it through 30 to 60 seconds I don't know maybe it's just allowing your mouth or your body to absorb it before swallowing I'm not really sure the reason but I do what the directions tell me and I've had a really positive results with it like I said the worst of it it's just it's not the most pleasant taste but it's not bad either they feel like it would taste the same if you swallow it any kind of oil you know so it just tastes a little bit of getting used to but it's totally fine and I really like it a kind of great results it's easy it's natural organic GMO free and it's honestly so good for so many things like I mentioned the pain relieve the anxiety and stress relieved I'm helping you see so that can improve your mood and everything so I would really if you're having any kind of issues like that I would definitely try out pure green labs hemp oil so really awesome products and they're definitely a judgment product and something I would recommend to people so I hope you guys found this video useful and I hope you try out pure green Lam's hemp oil another good one guys you [Music]", "RyyKvATLFOM": "what's going on people Sam here with Berryhill and I want to take this time to answer a question that we've been receiving a lot lately and that is the differences between full-spectrum CBD and broad spectrum CBD now I'm gonna answer this question in a way that I like to get questions answered and that is the easiest way possible so I'm going to try and do that for you guys as well now the main differences is this when I think full-spectrum CBD think about the full cannabis plant and all the components inside of it into an oil now and that includes THC now THC is the component that actually causes psychoactive effects on the human body so for some people that may be anxiety but some people are just relaxing and you know kind of seeing things and hearing things that they kind of want to hear in their minds but for me personally I like to avoid THC just because I like to have that control and with full-spectrum CBD you have a chance of having high rates of THC now a broad section of CBD you have all those components as well the terpenes everything involved in the cannabis and hemp plant but without the CHC component now the broad spectrum CBD is what can be sent and shipped out all across state lines all throughout the country and all throughout the world because there is no traces of THC in it so that's the kind of CBD that you guys are going to be getting especially if you live in the state that doesn't have a medical marijuana program and also does not have any kind of laws that have to do with having cannabis in your in your home and in your hand so we hear a very oh we want to make sure the best options for CBD if you have any questions about CBD feel free to reach out to

other products on ulta.com because there's more than just what i'm showing you right now i'm just showing you their brand new launch which i think you guys without even trying anything they all look beautiful so i'm very very excited all right so let's just get started okay so the first product i'm gonna take right over here is this blueberry kush 300 milligram cbd body scrub this is a detoxifying and illuminating body scrub that you use in the shower so this is awesome because if you look at the packaging you can easily tell that they are cruelty free they're organic they are like they don't test anything on animals so within this little product is actually a thousand blueberries and and it's in every single one of their blueberry cush line which is absolutely amazing this oil is proven to boost your ahas bhas which is amazing there's also vegan collagen cannabis sativa organic coconut and it's just so good so cbd it might scare you guys but honestly there are so many proven benefits to cbd that you guys can look up for yourself but from what i know it's actually proven to reduce anxiety and helps brighten and illuminate the skin so essentially this will help detoxify and as i said illuminate the skin their whole entire goal is to illuminate the skin to make you look and feel good healthy and glowy this is a sugar-based scrub so it really gets off all the dead skin cells that you just don't want on your body and with fall and winter approaching us new englanders and anyone up north you need this because my skin gets so beyond dry in the fall and the winter time so i'm definitely going to be using this all the time so not only does this nourish your skin but also hydrates your skin at the same time and you will find this in a common theme with all of these products within this line just because of like the cbd asset to it it really just truly helps nourish and hydrate the skin and i don't want to seem like i'm repeating these terms but honestly i just really love these products and i just want to be honest with you guys so it totally is nourishing and hydrating when i first tried it out smells absolutely amazing if you look at it and open it it literally smells like candy like you are gonna smell so good like look at the color so cute so when you put it on and just scrub in the shower you literally smell so good and i found the smell actually lingers for a lot longer than like i initially thought like a lot of the cheap drugstore brand body scrubs this little guy literally lasts on your skin for so long so definitely 10 out of 10 for me on this product for sure okay so moving right on i'm gonna review this guy right here for you this is the blueberry kush cbd body lotion i love the packaging on it if you guys can see it's like gold and the coloring is absolutely amazing so it smells it's a little less so you'll notice here that the smell with the body lotion is a lot less oh it smells so good it's a little bit less than the body scrub so this will definitely help enhance the body scrub smell but the lotion obviously still smells like blueberries except it's a lot less like low like it's a lot less like overwhelming than the body scrub is and i personally like the way the body scrub smells a lot more but the lotion is so beyond hydrating and it feels like it's really truly moisturizing your skin if you guys can see that like it has an oil base to it it feels like so it's definitely gonna stay on your skin for a long time and definitely benefit you throughout the day from like when you put it on so if you put it on before bed oh my gosh like after you shave ladies and then if you do oh my gosh like this is definitely gonna be a game changer so once again it's formulated with 300 milligrams of cbd oil which again is very beneficial for your skin and the oil of a thousand blueberries a thousand blueberries that are going to help hydrate nourish and illuminate your skin of course this is a common theme as i already said throughout all the products in this line so i personally would use this lotion right after i shave and with the body scrub totally use this before you shave which you guys are going to be like huh but like no you definitely want to use this before you shave to help get away all the dead skin cells before you start shaving and then you could obviously use it again after you shave to make your skin extra soft and then once you get out of the shower i'm going to follow up with this body lotion right here to maintain that hydration that this body scrub helped you achieve okay so next product is this blueberry kush body oil i love me a good body oil and i'm so excited because of the cbd at like aspect to this product because as i said cbd really really helps calm anxiety it is just overall a very calming product it just lays on your skin and relaxes your muscles and your skin cells and it just overall calms you down and i personally use a lot of cbd products so i'm very excited to add this to my routine so what i'm gonna do with this oil right here so i first of all the packaging hello packaging this is not cheap packaging guys look at it like how freaking cute it's also blue like what the thought and the generosity in these products are just absolutely amazing i love the gold i just overall love truly's just overall product standpoint it definitely does not look cheap so it's just this little dropper tool as you guys can see so what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna add this into the lotion that i just showed you guys you can also just add this after you put on the lotion to add an extra like shine to whatever body part you're putting this on for me i'm putting this literally everywhere after i shave and get out of the shower and use the body scrub so this also just hydrates your skin again nourishes it and obviously the blueberry aspect to it all the oil from the blueberries thousand blueberries if i haven't already said though and the cbd oil aspect is definitely gonna add a really nice smoothing hydrating calming relaxing aspect to it which is really really exciting so i definitely would add this into the lotion that i just showed you guys to really enhance everything that you just did so overall 10 out of 10. absolutely obsessed all right moving right along so i'm gonna show you guys the blueberry kush face oil yup i just said face oil so once again fall and winter are coming where your skin gets so beyond dry because of the cold frigid temperatures outside it is just not a fun time and if you're like me and you live in the city and you live in a very windy very cold area when it's like that kind of season i highly highly recommend face oil and this one is the way to go because one it smells good looks good and hydrates your skin so if i haven't already said this the blueberries do also help detoxify your skin so if you're having like any breakouts if you're suffering from any texture hi look at hair she's cute so this is a vegan clean high performing animal cruelty free fragrance free and harsh chemical free in this little face oil right here it is detoxifying and illuminating so you definitely want this what i'm going to use this for is i'm going to actually mix it in to my skincare routine by adding it in the moisturizer i personally do not enjoy putting oils without any moisturizing base or you can honestly just plop the oil droplets in to the palm of your hand tap it and just pat it on your skin i'm obviously going to show you guys how i use it so highly recommend very excited to use this for the very cold winter coming ahead hopefully it's not that cold but you know what i mean so this is definitely very very helpful when it comes to us new england girls so in boys alrighty guys the last and final product i'll be reviewing for you guys is the heartbreaker jelly lip plumping mask i'm so excited for this look at the packaging obviously packaging is a very very ideal for me and just look at it look at the color it is so cute so right when you open it it's just this jelly consistency as a lot of cute like little heart little confetti things in there so cute and this is awesome for a mask because one you can have a lot of fun with it take cute pictures with it it is just so cute and obviously it's not going to stay on your lips for a long time so don't worry about the confetti little droplets in there so this moisturizes your lips and temporarily plumps your lips which what more could we want nowadays i love the look of plump lips i think it's really really cute and really trendy right now this also minimizes fine lines and creases within your lips which is amazing keep your lips looking young and plump and hydrated so this is awesome because it's anti-aging and it heals any like lip marks or you know what i mean like you know what i mean like i feel like we have like weird lip marks that we like don't know how to handle so this is definitely the cure for that

bye", "-2j8GUQYU5A": "[Music] hey guys my name is Kat and today I want to review a CV product line and I really enjoyed its benefits so far so I want to share with you my experience with it and how I can help you and if you are open to the idea of using CBD as an alternative botanical medicine for your ear health so why should we consider CBD well it's been around for a very long time I think since the 1940s it's been discovered or or recognized and only recently in the last less than a decade I would say less than a decade that we have been using it publicly so it's been available to the public in the United States so only a few states left that don't have legality over it but it's almost there okay so what is CBD CBD is Kenneth video Kenna video is a cannabinoid it's a type of one of many one of a hundred cannabinoids in marijuana so it's the one that doesn't get you high you can pass a drug test and it doesn't make you feel any psychedelic effects or any kind of conscious altering effects it's not addictive that you don't feel the addiction the next day or anything like that neither with cannabis or or the one you smoke to get high but I mean there's been many many studies now proving that and it's a wonderful alternative for many many drugs out there so it's good for many many things it's anti-inflammatory it slowly kills bacteria it's good for promoting bone growth its antipsychotic so if you have psychosis it's really good for that so it's also lowering sugar in the blood so it's great for Dennett diabetics it helps prevent blocked arteries it helps prevent seizures it's anti-anxiety it helps prevent tumor growth is perfect for protecting yourself against so many things oh and it's neuroprotective so it protects your brain and the reason it works so well with us is because we have cannabinoid receptors in our bodies everyone does even your pets so it is designed to work with us we have receptors like almost like a lock and a key fit together there's hundreds of them in our bodies so it works well so why have i started taking CBD because i have actually a friend in this company called Kanna hemp and they actually sent me a package of things to try and I've been trying them for a while and I have made a previous video of CBD and we've tried that that was our first time trying CBD that was a different kind that was water-based and even the lady at the store mentioned to me to one day get the oils like these because they have actually a longer lasting effect in within the body so water base compared to the oil the water base is fast-acting it puts it into effect faster in your body but I feel like it's a little bit more messed with so I prefer the natural oil where it's just extracted from the plants so I prefer the simple formulas I mean these have such a short ingredient list which I really love it's just coconut oil and chemical 'video terpenes it's so simple it tastes good I haven't had any kind of like negative side effects you know you do have to keep in mind how CBD works make sure you know how it works in your body before you go drive or you know you go try it on a day off if it's your first time you know make sure your nothing else is in your body so you can really feel the effects to pay attention to your body um I just feel calm I take it for anxiety I have a lot of things going on in my head I'm always working I'm constantly on my computer my brain is just buzzing so I'm actually a lot calmer right now than I usually a.m. maybe you could tell my past videos how exciting I am I'm excited to make you guys videos but it really does feel stressful sometimes just the pace that I'm going the speed that I'm going and cvd has really just kind of grounded me and CBD is actually wonderful even for your pets I don't know if you haven't given my cats any CDs there's actually a whole line on their website just for your pets so and then there's so many fun ways you can apply CBD now you could put it through your skin it's transdermal so they have awesome lotions there's a whole variety of smells that you can pick and it's just simple it's non greasy I use the harlot haze one and it smells divine it's kind of like a like a clean lavender II just a very nice purple smell I can't really describe it so you could put it right on your skin so let's say you don't want to inhale a vapor they do have vaporizers but they have lotions for those who don't they have also this great relief cream so if you have any discomfort like you're an athlete or you just go to the gym you're physically active and you just need a good muscle rub or you just need to increase circulation or just really just think right directly to that spot of pain so you don't have to wait for it to go through your whole body I think that's a little more immediate pain relief the CBD recovery and wellness cream the athletic one I feel that one work really well like I really put it to the test I had some lower back pain and I put that right on and I wasn't it was my first time trying it and I wasn't sure if it was gonna get cool enough you know it's like that icy hot kind of feeling and sure enough it just gradually slowly very comfortably warmed up and started doing that hot cold sensation that we love and it lasted quite a bit and I felt it work my pain was gone and I'm very happy with it another way I've been using this stuff and a lot of people don't think of this application is to use these oils directly on your face you know it's a wonderful moisturizer if you have any inflammation or bacterial growth it will help put that at keep that at bay so you should try it a couple times I used to calm one on my face because it's really calming sometimes I have puffy under eyes from waking up in the morning you can just do a nice gentle massage and it's the kind of oil that like absorbs it's not gonna leave you like a grease ball the product that I went through the fastest was the vape pen I love how fast it delivers the benefits if you like to be on the go you just need a little small dose you just need to maintain your your dropper full that you took in the morning the vapor pen is you know it's very easy it's very it's not very harsh it's very easy to use and it's just the cool pad it really lights up and it has this wonderful wonderful flavor it's very mild and those with the fastest check out their website guys I've linked to everything down below and the website you'll find a whole line of like I said lotions lip balms so guys I've left a link below for you for their website you could find their whole line of CBD and hemp products remember they have a whole line for your pets even they have lotions creams lip balms they have the fake pen they have cartridges they even have the oils so if you really want to check it out check out the link thank you so much for watching let me know in the comments below share your CBD experience the last video I made there was some wonderful comments and it's so good to hear that you know finally we have something like this that is really helping fight the balance of all this pharmaceutical epidemics you know I heard that there is this drop in opioid use because of the introduction of CB so what an awesome thing that is and we can really really I mean I don't think I need to mention this is like one of the best painkillers out there give it a try guys CVD is safe you could use it and feel good about it because it's good for the environment it's not going to have any negative side effects you know just everyone's gonna have a different experience some might be over stimulated somebody to tranquilised from it so keep that in mind there there's other kinds there's other blends there's other strengths maybe you don't feel the drop or fall all the way baby just use a little bit so just remember your body does have its own unique Constitution different from everyone in my range from day to day week

the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "kGQHY9DLWTI": "today Minnesota's Pharmacy Board discussed regulating CBD CBD is derived from cannabis plants but from a different part than what gives you the high that's usually associated with marijuana that's the THC CBD has been found to have the opposite effect decreasing your heart rate your blood pressure and anxiety but there has not been a lot of research done on CBD and tonight our Jessica miles goes in-depth to show us just how readily available it is and the growing concern over how it's sold this particular one is salted-caramel andrew freiburg owns one life products a kiosk inside Eden Prairie Mall a lot of people love the alternative of having something natural the oils lotions and edibles he sells all contain CBD from industrial hemp a chemical that some claim has significant health benefits people are using it for anti inflammatory people reason for sleep and just about everything else but mainly pain that's a huge one I would say that's 35 to 45 percent of our business this is one of Freiburg's products you can see the CBD right here the label also states that it is tested by a third-party everything that we have is third-party tested by trusted labs that will tell you exactly what's in there so there's no question as to what you're actually taking but that is a concern Quan Deer percentage of CBC and it's why the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy is looking into CBD regulations our concern is that these products because they're unregulated are not going to state accurately what they contain may contain things like herbicides and insecticides and heavy metals and that claims are being made that just aren't true executive director Cody Weinberg says CBD can come from both hemp and marijuana plants he says CBD products that are properly formulated contain only minimal amounts of THC the primary chemical in marijuana that gives that high feeling it does have side effects it does interact with other drugs if you're going to use it then just really exercise some caution he is expecting legislation this session 100 natural that Freiberg says he welcomes it I'm very concerned about some of the the vape culture I'm concerned about some of the smaller shops that are just throwing stuff up on the shelf they don't know where they're getting it they don't know the purity they don't have paperwork with it and it's giving you know the whole industry a bad name Jessica miles 5 Eyewitness News we can tell you why berg says he has not heard from any lawmakers yet but says if he doesn't in the next week he will reach out with the hope of getting a bill sponsored and ultimately signed into law regulating CBD", "6RyjjthK7VQ": "so one thing i really want to remind you of before we get into this video is that you are beautiful inside and out um greetings from the swirly couch my name is caitlyn michelle and today we are here to discuss ima so i experienced eczema as a baby and into my late teen years i was actually born with eczema and i can fully relate to the struggles of not only just the skin condition but also the emotional struggles that came with having um experience having experienced a skin condition and you know i noticed growing up i was very insecure i didn't feel comfortable you know putting myself out there you know meeting new people and even just speaking i was just so nervous because i was worried of what were people thinking of my face or my arms that were rashed out and red and you know my face that was you know covered in a rash and super dry and so for me growing up dealing with eczema at a really young age first of all they're already very limited treatment options and the prescription treatment options that were available um there were age restrictions on so given that i was a baby with eczema you can't just put anything on a baby's skin or even a young child under the age of five so for me i really struggled with finding treatment options that really helped my skin was so sensitive that i could only use specific kind of soap i couldn't use anything scented like i really had a lot of limitations in my skin care you know so if you're watching this i'm sure you or someone close to you is dealing with eczema and i just want you to know that you're not alone and that you are beautiful inside and out and that relief is totally possible and to allow yourself to be open to that possibility of relief and confidence in your own skin again so like i said relief is totally possible when i was growing up there were very limited treatment options and i was so young at the time that any of the prescription treatment options i wasn't a candidate for and i also lived in a family of six people so by the time i was of age to be a candidate for any of those medicines and those treatment options they were not affordable for my family and so therefore that was just not a treatment option that was available to me and now back in the 90s um when i was a baby um just a wee little taut um there were very limited treatment options which is why it's a beautiful time to be alive where we have so many different treatment options available to us so as much as there are many different treatment options available nowadays not all treatment options are the same not all treatment options are sustainable nor are all treatment options affordable which is why today i want to talk about cbd in the use of treating eczema as cbd can be an affordable non-prescription option that can help to manage the symptoms of the condition while also helping to improve your quality of life cbd can really help in the treatment of the condition by providing relief not only from the inflammation because eczema is an inflammatory response and cbd helps to treat the inflammation there was a study done in 2014 that had proven that cbd triggers an anti-inflammatory response in the cells of our body so when we're utilizing cbd we're working with something that is directly affecting the cells of our body it's not trying to just treat the symptoms but it's going more to the root of what's happening and treating the source of inflammation there which in my own personal opinion i feel that can be where we really start to notice drastic changes because we're working on a root basis rather than just working to treat the symptoms that we're experiencing so there's many different methods of how you can utilize cbd to treat eczema and you can just kind of test them out and see which one aligns most with you so you can utilize ingestion where you like take a tincture or you take a capsule of cbd and that helps to work from an internal place to manage the any internal information inflammation that you may be experiencing there's also the method of topical use where you can use like a cbd soap or a cbd face mask or even like a cbd salve and those are ways that can directly help to nourish and soothe the skin externally and when you partner that with the internal addition of the cbd that can really help to be working from an internal as well as an external place to manage the condition i'm very thankful that i did outgrow the condition however i do still experience symptoms of very sensitive skin as a result for people who have outgrown the condition it is common to still experience very sensitive skin afterwards so therefore we do also have to be mindful of what we put on our skin to find products that align with us and products that are free of contaminants free of irritants and any pesticides one thing to note is that not all cbd products are equal and not all cbd products are pure some may contain trace amounts of pesticides or irritants or contaminants which is why it's very important to get your cbd from a company that has their cbd third party tested because cbd is not regulated by the fda or by the government and therefore it can legally be sold with any of those pesticides or irritants in the cbd product and yeah like we don't need that on our skin so it's super important to make sure that you're using a third party tested cbd product which is why i only trust thought cloud for my skin because thought cloud is 100 vegan they are organically grown as well as they are lab tested to ensure purity and ensure that there are no contaminants or irritants within the products that you are putting on your precious skin so my loves if you are looking to see if cbd might be a treatment option that aligns with you and you are looking to try something new um you can use my code key at checkout and you can save some money as my darling you", "rO1Ob9qkl_Y": "what's up y'all this is Joe here at mad Dave's aboon giving you another review today today it's an exciting product I'm RIA my time truthfully really excited about this because I use their product and they produce something else that is going to help many people so what we're gonna talk about today is hemp lucid hemp lucid is the CBD manufacturer they grow industrial hemp out of Colorado and they produce a fantastic full-spectrum product they have an entire line from water-soluble CBD to hemp seed oil the oil based to the vape drip version to lotions to gummy bears to capsules you can take if you don't want to taste it or you don't want to ingest it orally other than in pill form so traditionally they produce a fantastic full-spectrum product which means it's using the whole point they Co to extract it so no chemicals are used and you literally get plant matter in a bottle now they have produced a new line and today we're gonna be going over the water soluble from their new line so their new line is Kalki Kalki what this is is this is a th free version so before with regular hemp pellucid they're their first line it had THC in it now it's a minimal amount it's below the federal legal limit which is currently stated at 0.3% it was below that but it still was a drawback for some people who wanted to try CBD but they didn't want the effects of THC now you would never feel the effects of THC in hemp lucid but they were still just kind of drawn back they don't want any THC at all maybe their job drug tests which you shouldn't fail a drug test on that but people are still cautious you know if I had a if I had an extremely high paying job that required monthly drug tests I wouldn't want to risk it and whether the person behind the counter is telling me I won't fail a drug test or not I don't want to risk using that product so now they have created a new line of CBD still using their traditional whole plant matter but it's an isolate version so it is THC free now with this you're still getting all the added benefits from CBD and a water soluble form I always choose water-soluble because in my opinion it's the best one they have the water-soluble allows people with GI tract issues or someone who has trouble digesting to use this CBD and it's fast-acting it digests very quickly in your system they estimate about 15 minutes and you should start feeling the effects it is in your system so not only with water-soluble is it fast-acting but you can drip it under your tongue you can mix it into the liquids like I would love to put mine in coffee it adds a natural earthy taste to my coffee which I already like strong bitter coffees so that really adds a nice flavor that I enjoy but you can you can drip it under your tongue you can mix in a liquid you can put it on top of already cooked foods you can actually vape it so it's water-soluble to me is the do all you have hemp seed oil which you can drip under your tongue and that's about it you could technically put it into a liquid but it's going to separate because it's oil-based and you'll have to chug the whole thing real quick to make sure you get it so I think water soluble is the best version that they carry and now they have water soluble in their new kalki THC free line you're still getting the whole plant you're just not getting any THC with it but they there are no artificial ingredients there is no added anything it is literally the plant in a bottle and the great thing about this line is they're a little bit cheaper than the full spectrum line so you're saving yourself especially when you go to the higher milligrams you're saving yourself upwards of 40 bucks so that's it that's a huge savings for anybody whether you're wealthier or you're making it a week-to-week like like most of us that is a huge savings so definitely check them out I'll have another video on there MCT oil or medium chain triglycerides but if you have any questions feel free to ask also feel free to check out their website hemp lucid calm they are very straightforward and they will show you everything you need to know to make you an informed buyer and to make you more informed about CBD and the benefits it has so

for pain both of these types of products can be very effective in terms of pain relief what it comes down to mostly is the type of pain that you're trying to treat in this video summary we touch on a few key aspects relating to the ongoing discussion between cbd oils versus cbd creams for pain relief we'll also dish out some examples of when to use both to achieve the most effective results possible so stay tuned before we get directly into the content let me just remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf channel we offer the industry's best resource for medically backed information on cannabis strains cbd and everything else related to cannabis and health back to the topic of cbd oil versus cbd cream for pain relief there's a ton of discussion in this space recently especially among various cannabis-centric media outlets cbd oils and cbd creams are two of the most common forms of hemp derived cbd products as far as the ability for each one to help treat pain and provide adequate relief it really comes down to the location and the type of pain that you're dealing with oils and topical creams each have their own unique uses throughout the medical community in fact they're both capable of reducing a variety of pain and inflammation related symptoms cbd topicals tend to work well in helping reduce localized inflammation stemming from arthritis muscle soreness and cramping the other benefit of these types of products is that unlike cbd oil they can be applied directly to the site of pain and discomfort in some individuals topicals can also help with painful skin related conditions including symptoms related to eczema psoriasis and dermatitis cbd oils on the other hand often work well for things like headaches migraines and pain that stems from other areas that are hard to reach with direct application topicals that being said few people realize that one of the most effective forms of cbd-based pain relief is to use both oils and topical creams together so when you're browsing around online trying to figure out whether to use cbd oil or cbd cream for pain management don't discount the potential of using both simultaneously of course you'll always want to remember that the hemp cbd industry isn't regulated in the same way that the medical cannabis industry is be wary of where the cbd product you're using has come from and make sure that it's from a reliable trusted label ultimately the choice of using cbd oil or cbd cream for your pain relief comes down to your own unique needs if you suffer from localized pain like muscle or joint pain topical creams may be the preferred method of attack however the most effective results can often be achieved by using topicals and cbd oils together in combination was this video

actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like

with the new range it's just amazing i can't even describe how luxurious it feels so it's the cbd range and how stunning are those bottles as well so so nice it's beautiful what can i tell you about it so they trust the cbd range as a range of products for stressed and dehydrated skin that i think is quite clear and evident here and i'm suffering with a lot of dehydration at the moment i don't know if it's just me or anybody else that wearing a mask and i don't know if it happens with the fabric ones because i can't seem to get on with those but the um disposable ones when i put them on if i've had them on even for as less as 10 minutes and by the time i've taken it off this whole area of my face feels dehydrated it's almost like the the moisturizer that i put on has just been zapped out so this is really good for getting some hydration back into the skin and making that dull looking stressed out skin luminous again and so we're gonna go through the products and then i'll let you know sort of what's in them and what you can expect from from from the products themselves okay so i've got a dry face and we're gonna start with the soothing oil balm cbd this is what it looks like pop some in your hand about sort of that much i guess and then warm it in your hands just don't sit nice and long and then put onto your face it feels a little bit like the chamomile butter it's got that same sort of feel to it when you're putting it on the skin really work it in and you can leave this for up to five minutes so you can use this daily i would say if you've got makeup on to obviously use a makeup remover first or afterwards because it isn't and they cut remover like the butter you will end up with panda eyes afterwards if you don't so it's kind of got like a shiny oil like consistency so i'm just going to leave that into the skin um and i think because it's an oil it is kind of hydrating the skin and and it already you know it feels luminous it kind of gives that sheen to the skin my skin at the moment is as i say incredibly dehydrated i think that is a mix of the mask obviously here like i said but obviously the change in weather because i've noticed a difference in my lips as well they're really really dry right i'm going to wash it off now just using channel you can just take that off okay that's all off now skin feels really smooth this is the magic it's so good so this is the cbd restoring facial oil it's heaven it's so so nice i'm not just saying it it's amazing so got a nice pipette [Music] i'm gonna use about four drops into your hands oh it's so nice oh so good it's hard to describe how nice this oil is going on to your skin and you can almost feel it soaking in it's just the best it's so so nice it's so so nice okay so let me tell you what is in this amazing range of products you've got ah i don't know if i'm pronouncing this right so don't don't quote me on it because i don't even know what it is maybe i should do a bit of research into this product itself but i think it's called sacqualine it might not be it might be squalane i have no idea but anyway that's in there patchouli i love patchouli petrus got a really nice smell to it and it just it's just so nice and you've got hemp seed oil and the natural origin cbd oil so lots of good things with cbd's associated with stress skin and so it's good for that and we all need a bit of that don't we okay so i've let the oil sink in which i just love i think it's amazing and as another preventative barrier and i am going to put on the replenishing moisture cream again look how lovely these pots are they're just so beautiful this is quite a i'd say thick cream not not too thick but thicker than slightly thicker than the vitamin e oh it's just it's just it feels so luxurious it really really does it's got a really really subtle smell to it but when i'm so subtle it almost reminds me of like a smell that kicks around as far it's that subtle kind of earthy smell it's just so nice i always go down the neck with whatever moisturizer i'm using so nice my skin feels incredibly smooth really really moisturized and not half as dull as what it was looking that's it this is the finished look really luminous hydrated skin and i honestly i'm raving about this product i absolutely love it this is i will use this all the time it's just i just love it and you can use all bits daily um morning and night which i have been doing probably for about the last five days maybe um and i i just i just love it i think it's amazing i think and as the weather gets colder and and then crisp sort of um chilly mornings come in with the ice and things i think you will really um it will be really um beneficial to your skin thank you so much for watching this video uh taking

your body and well-being so as to figure out which cannabis item is suited for you you need to investigate the difference between hemp oil and CBD oil in terms of ingredients in their making so let's jump on the differences between both of these smell and appearance wise hemp oil is of nutty flavor and has a clear light green color whereas CBD oil is of earthy flavor and has a golden color industrially hemp oil is extracted from cold-pressed seeds of the plant but on the other hand CBD oil is made from Leafs flowers and stalks of the hemp where canopy oil is found although both of them are derived from a common plant they have different properties and medicinal advantages but both of these oils may contain up to 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol also known as THC and you must carefully

scope of medical advantages which is incorporate alleviation from pain aggravation and sleeping disorder for those touchy to the high of THC simile offers the intensity of the cannabis plant without

bit about the different terms that people use in the industry and in the CBD community to differentiate between the different types of active CBD that that's you that are used that's being used in all the products that were selling and consuming mainly the difference between isolate broad spectrum and full-spectrum CBD oil I've created a little video graphic a little video yakety I guess you call it a video graphic to explain and kind of help me explain the differences so you guys can understand it really easily before we get into that really quick I just want to let you know that in the research that I did to prepare for this video I talked with a few different companies that extract haven't been turned it into concentrates and basically what I've noticed is they're either very willing to share their information and talk openly about what they're doing they or on the on the other hand they are completely full of [ __ ] and you can tell they're bullshitting mean trying to make themselves seem larger than they are and then you have the the third group of people that I talked to and again kind of biessing a little bit but more so to protect their their proprietary technique or they're a little bit more suspicious of why I'm asking so they the information they gave was rather vague so we're gonna keep this this video very high-level we're not going to deep dive into the the exact nuances that go into extracting CBD from hemp but we are going to talk about just kind of the basics and and break it down in a way that's very easy to understand and hopefully by the end of this video everybody will have a clear understanding of what isolate is what broad-spectrum CBD oil is and what full-spectrum CBD oil is so let's jump into my computer and check it out okay so we are now in my computer we're calling this the over-the-shoulder cam from time to time we're gonna jump into my computer like this it just makes it a little bit easier for me to explain things when you can see exactly what I'm seeing when it comes to making CBD extracts for the most part all of the companies out there are using hemp you have a small handful of companies that are using low THC marijuana but that's not what we're talking here we're talking about hemp based CBD extracts and how they're made so what what happens is the extraction companies they start with hemp whether it's PCR hemp which is vital cannabinoid rich hemp or industrial hemp the difference between those two is a topic that we will cover in a future video for the sake of this video we're just going to call it hemp and they take their hemp and they run it through an extraction process so that means they're taking all of the plant material all of the hemp material after it's been harvested they're putting it into an extraction machine they're running a solvent through all of that material whether it's co2 ether something like that some sort of non-volatile solvent and what comes out on the other end of that machine is crude crude a CBD crude oil is very similar in texture and in looks to motor oil it's literally very very dark it the smell is very strong the flavor is very bitter and while it is very high in all of the compounds and cannabinoids that everybody craves and is in is seeking it's not very consumer friendly just because it's so bitter it's so strong and it's so ugly so what people do or what companies do is they take that that crude and they refine it even further than they put it through the distillation process and in doing so there's going to be some minor changes chemical on a chemical level and on a molecular level I guess you could say you're gonna have on the the CBD a convert to CBD and what happens is you end up with a product that is much more consumer friendly it tastes better it looks better and overall just works better and that's what we know as full-spectrum CBD distillate now when I'm talking about a full spectrum product or full spectrum CBD oil or distillate I'm referring to a product that contains everything including th see all of the cannabinoids all of the compounds the flavonoids and the oils vitamins everything including THC that's what i'm talking about when i when I'm using the term full-spectrum CBD distillate and the full-spectrum distillate it's used a few different ways the most common way that people are using the full-spectrum product is to create new and other products they're using it as the active ingredient in the gummies they're tinctures dog treats anything that you see on the market that is being labeled or being marketed as a full-spectrum product more than likely or most likely or what should be happening is the the CBD being used to create that product is coming from a full spectrum CBD distillate now another way that full-spectrum CBD distillate is being used is to create broad-spectrum distillate broad spectrum CBD distillate is full-spectrum CBD distillate with the THC removed there is an entire segment of the consumer market out there that's very interested in trying and using CBD products but for whatever reason whether it's they're an athlete maybe it's a job issue whatever they are not interested or had they have no interest at all in consuming THC so what's happening what's being done is the full-spectrum distillate is being refined even one step further they're pulling out the THC they're creating the broad spectrum CBD distillate and then that broad spectrum product is used to create other gummies tinctures dog treats etc and the third way that full-spectrum CBD distillate is used is to create CBD isolate the CBD I slit is exactly what it sounds like it's the CBD molecule that's been isolated and extracted on its own it's it comes in the form of a white powder there's very little flavor very little smell and it's a very useful product in that it can be easily incorporated into just about any type of product or recipe that you could think of the downside is many people think that because isolate doesn't contain any of the other cannabinoids or pretty much anything else found in the hemp plant that it's not going to be as beneficial it's not going to work as effectively as maybe a broad spectrum or a full spectrum product but for the most part you know people are taking that CBD isolate they're using it to to create all of the same exact same type of product that people are creating using the broad spectrum and the full-spectrum distillates but what the main difference being there's there's nothing else in those products except CBD there's no other beneficial cannabinoids or calm at all so I hope this this little graphic this video has been helpful I hope this has been an easy way for you guys to understand the difference between isolate full spectrum and broad spectrum we're gonna go ahead and jump back out of my computer get back into the office and wrap things up okay I hope that little video graphic helped you guys understand the difference is a little bit better between isolate broad spectrum and full spectrum I know that there is more to it there's more nuance to the extraction process than I described I get it I just wasn't trying to make this some big drawn-out 45-minute video we'll cover that in detail a little bit better in a future video if you're an extract or out there you don't need to message me and tell me that I should have done a better job covering decarboxylation and the conversion from cbda to CBD I get it and we will definitely cover it like I said I was just trying to keep this kind of high level provide enough information so that you guys can make better decisions when it comes to the products that you're buying and asked you know they're just the right questions you know when you ask a manufacturer of a product what kind of CBD is in this and they tell you it's broad spectrum or it's full spectrum or it's isolated you should know what that means so if you guys have any questions any comments or any complaints use the comment section below and I will see you guys in the next video peace", "L1A_hy1YL_k": "[Music] hi everyone and welcome to

Michelin and how in the story that he goes through and it's fascinating and so to sort of get us into this for people who don't know anything about it could you just explain what is CBD what are we talking about okay but let me first say that I am a family physician primarily that was my graduate training after medicine so I've been I did the whole nine yards delivered babies did vasectomies took care of infants children adults and geriatrics the whole thing and I was I was practiced that for the entire time that I was in the military until I retired in 96 then I went I started doing disease management starting in 2000 and then I'm trying to figure out mechanisms and ways to to hack the body and try and trying to get the outcomes that we should be seeing from current medical therapy but we're not really achieving those and so that's that's part of my course and and how I've been there now moving back to a cannabidiol this is a substance and it's commonly referred to as CBD and it comes from him now if we talk about the hemp plant there or the cannabis plant it's really of two varieties on the one hand you've got marijuana that contains THC on the other hand you've got the heme sometimes called industrial hemp that doesn't contain any significant amount of THC but it has most of the cannabidiol so THC makes you high CBD makes you healthy and fundamentally that is the principle that's behind it okay yeah so I think that's what I always like to just bring that up in the beam because it seems like that's the most common misconception like myth breaking number one is that it's not marijuana it's not the stuff that gets you high when you take the spray could so I can tell people no I didn't get high by spraying this stuff under my tongue so you mentioned earlier there too about industrial hemp do we get different types of hemp then well there's several different species well they're not actually species are called cultivars and there we sometimes separate them into cannabis sativa or one of some of the other varieties but it's and a lot of people will focus on that I don't focus on that the sativa is the most common variety and has the highest levels of cannabidiol and there are cultivars that come from the industrial hemp that or from the marijuana plant that provide different combinations of other substances what dr. mushy lumps calls the entourage and these are also very important there are the other cannabinoids that are in the plant is probably about a hundred that are in just this plant alone and there's many others have found in nature but there's also terpenes and these are small fat molecules that contain I have a different blend then the terpenes are the things that you are have strong odor that you encounter so such as pine scent or lemon or grapefruit they actually are some of these compounds these fragrant essential oils that are commonly used that have stimulating properties on the body in addition so within the plant there are also flavonoids and other substances and fight halls that are quite valuable to the body we just haven't really drilled down into these biologic substance in the advantage now the important thing and I want to get across is that that entourage that those extra substances are very valuable in terms of how the CBD is working within the body because that's part of that entourage that makes the really good effects that come from it so yeah it's we don't just want something in isolation completely we want it the other natural forming chemicals around it I guess it's the same as when people say you know eat real food because there's a different effect when you have real food versus a supplement for example and you've just got me thinking there then so when we try extract it you know the the CBD from a hemp plant then we are drawing in all these other entourage chemicals where we and it's not just somehow it depends on how the extraction goes what people that I've been working with the election oil company has been using a supercritical co2 extraction so they're using carbon dioxide as the solvent to pull out the cannabinoids and the fight halls and the flavonoids that come from it and that process gets the the greatest and the fullest extraction of that entourage at the same time whereas it doesn't contain any alcohol or toxic substances that are going to be irritating or cause any problem it's also very healthy for the environment as well ok so that's the top tip there already is look for co2 extracted CBD oil that's the what people need to look for I think that's a key and important thing but the other point that they need to look for is they need to look at the certificate of analysis that's done by a third party that examines exactly what is in the product that they're looking at so you want to know certainly how much cannabidiol is there you want to know if it contains any THC which it should not you want to look at perhaps some of the other cannabinoids that are present in it you want to make sure it doesn't have any toxins or solvents or any biologic substance though so that it has bacteria in it or heavy metals or pesticides and that should all be available when you're looking for a product so you know exactly what's in and then you're not going to cause additional damage as a result of it I just want to go back to I didn't and talk about cannabidiol the molecule it's a it's actually a small molecule it's a small fat molecule it's 22 carbons and so it's not a whole lot different than some of the oils that we take in like medium chain triglycerides or coconut oil it's very similar and the body processes through this fat metabolism mechanism and as a result of that it's it's you seeing a system that we haven't learned a whole lot about but it is key and important to the body's overall function in fact on some of the other molecules that you may be familiar with like omega-3 fats that are DHA and EPA are actually very very similar to cannabidiol and some of the other cannabinoids so that's fascinating way that I know that you're a fan of the low carb diets or the ketogenic diet and that's another reason out I I wanted to get you on because the reason I got interested in the keto world was because of seizure patients and going Wow okay so these these fat molecules these ketones all these ketone bodies they seem to be good for our neurology for our brain and what you're saying here is that the cannabinoid can have been oh yeah okay the cannabinoids in avonlea in a bird's they are sort of following the same pathways and that's you know I'm going to get onto that in later into our discussion about some of the common things to use the CBD oil in but you know for seizure patients so it's it's yeah I want to delve deeper into sort of that field later on into the discussion for sure but just pulling back into then just to finish off with the quality aspect before we get into that so taking hemp oil on its own is not the same as just taking CBD oil so do you I guess are you going to get a much smaller percentage of CBD in hemp oil if someone had to take it as a supplement or is it or the to the same right just if it's if it's considered it's it's hard to say depending it's what the manufacturer really wants it to be so if it's just hemp oil then it's not a whole lot different than olive oil you just you have to look at the individual ingredients and very very low concentrations of any cannabinoids that our president lots of good things there are some omega-3s but it doesn't have a high concentration of any of the cannabinoids that our president now oftentimes we so you have to look very closely at the label because some of the cannabidiol the CBD products are actually being labeled as hemp oil in order to probably get around restrictions and legislation and negative aspects that people associate with hemp so that it's more easily available and I can only explain it that way because you have to look at the label to find out how much cannabidiol is actually located in the product mm-hmm okay so talking physiology stuff again when I watch that documentary I didn't realize that the human body makes can Anna KITT Kenneth can Anna Boyd sorry I told you I was gonna get some guys on this one but yes if you could just explain for handling cannabinoid like molecules it's incredible this was discovered in 1992 and it's it's a comprehensive system appears to be a master controller for many of our other body systems and we really weren't aware of it unfortunately even though we have thousands of articles about this system over over 8,000 articles within PubMed on medical literature we still don't have an awareness by physicians and by the general public about how comprehensive and how important the endocannabinoid system is in our lives it controls and it regulates so many things are our appetite our emotions it handles the neurotransmitters our immunologic system and it's all regulated with a complex system that has its own synthetic material to create the cannabinoids and it has the degradation it also has transporter molecules and it has a number of boosters that work within the synapses of the muscles or in in the in order to make the cannabinoids work differently it's it's controlling the neurotransmitters it's it's regulating the immune system it's working on the hormones and of all places it's working on the gut fabulous in terms of regulation on normalizing the gut when we fast we turn off the endocannabinoid system in terms of that stimulation that may cause some disturbances it's also working on cellular metabolism it's actually shifting cellular metabolism in a very similar way as ketones do okay yes so we do produce them then the body produces a natural amount on its own and that's and a good example for people to visualize that is in breast milk apparently that when the baby's feeding on it and that's when they get that sort of breast milk i when they're so happy afterwards and they didn't they unlatch it's because if the mother has given them a good dose perfect example and you know the canal and the endocannabinoid system controls the implantation of the egg in the uterus as well so we're getting down to the very smallest fertilized egg and the impact of this endocannabinoid system but you know we can get it in the foods that we eat as well and I'm not just talking about cannabis I'm talking about chocolate and truffles um probably other foods as well and it's found in flax the flax cloth actually contains cannabidiol specifically - and that improves healing if you use the flax cloth as a bandage Wow okay I don't know that's a flax cloth for bandaging that that would be quite novel so we've got these these receptors all over over multiple systems our body as you said the gut the brain muscles all over the place and I do find it fascinating because when I when I studied physiology this system was never brought up at all which I find amazing because it is so influential as you said so I guess in what decade was that very I graduate in 2004 so that was the early 2000 so as you said in 1992 it should it I should have already been hearing about it at least reading about in the physiology textbooks that's right you should have and you should be hearing about it now but less than 5% of medical schools in the United States are teaching or informing any of the physicians or the medical students about it at all in fact most of the physicians that I talk to have no clue about the endocannabinoid system and yet it's so highly regulatory as what we talked about the neuro transmitters yeah and I think that comes back to why you're so excited about this whole system because you have a substance now or a range of substances that you can administer to a patient and get different physiological responses I guess out of them which is what we're going to lead onto in it later in the discussion right and what it what turns out Gary is very interestingly is if we can have an endocannabinoid deficiency in fact deficiencies of the balance of the receptors and the agonist have been found in almost all major diseases so if we're talking about depression anxiety PTSD different types of cancers Crohn's disease Huntington's disease all of these diseases actually contain disturbances in the endocannabinoid system whether it's low levels of a an endocannabinoid busy as the agonist or it's high numbers of receptors whatever the balance is it's dysregulated and the thought is that if we could rebalance on that system then we might be able to restore health to the body because the main purpose of the endocannabinoid system is just to maintain homeostasis just to maintain normal not to make you a Superman in any way and so is there any risk of toxicity like taking an overdose of CBD like I take too much and I get a a negative side effect from it all is the body just going to eat reject and eject sort of excess levels if I had to ingest it no there is no toxicity no no person has ever died or have been seriously injured as a result of using cannabidiol can you get side effects from it they're rare and and only on high doses yeah if you look at some of the human studies that were done as much as 1,200 milligrams were used in adults with for example schizophrenia and it had no significant adverse effects whatsoever it's certainly no toxicity it's potentially it could interact with some other medications going through some of the liver pathways but it I haven't actually seen that as the normal doses that I have been recommending for people and I can I feel like I can use normal doses that are less than 200 milligrams of CBD when you use a high quality product that has a full entourage a full spectrum within it and not using isolate type of compounds so money mentioned medications there that that would be one of my questions because any listeners here who are taking it or they might be taking other forms of supplements or medications potentially are there any sort of common interactions that are known about or that that sort of hasn't been highlighted or studied as yet well there's been a lot of questions that I get about and if but if you look at the science on it you find out that there is a relative interference through the livers and cyp or cytochrome 450 system for metabolizing drugs and it has a potential of interfering but only at high doses well over 200 milligrams that's when it starts to to result in that there's only been a couple drugs that have been identified as being changed as a result of using cannabidiol most of those drugs have been associated with epilepsy so you have are using neurotransmitter modulator type of drug like clovers am which is a common drug that's used for epilepsy that can raise using CBD and Clopas am can either raise the level or decrease the level of Clopas am and then it goes the that's true for some of the other anti epileptic types of drugs and i it's and it's also true for some of the neurotransmitter types of drugs that we use for schizophrenia and for parkinson's disease you know l-dopa is essentially is a neurotransmitter dopamine a substitute to give to people if you combine that with CBD you could potentiate at the neurotransmitter level so there there is some synergy that happens with on the other hand there is some very positive interaction as a result of using CBD with some other drugs like low dose naltrexone it actually amplifies the effects of in a complimentary way not to make it excessive but complement antidepressants SSRI type of drugs for depression on it compliments of those particular drugs although it's my firm belief that CBD can correct for my depression in a very short order within a matter of days and then the SSRIs are don't need to be used at all yeah and that's that would be exciting again just for patients here because usually again especially if we're talking antidepressants when someone gets put on them they tend to get put on them for quite a while not just a couple of years so and that's exciting for you too to say like no here's another six more even more Gary and it takes as long as six weeks for an anti depression to work whereas I see changes in people immediately by taking CBD they don't have to wait weeks they can see it in the same day changes in their mood and their behavior and their overall outlook on life fantastic you know and it's a natural substance again at the end of the day which is which I like and so just moving away from medications than supplements would when we were talking earlier about MCTS and other sort of fat soluble vitamins would we're taking CBD with supplements enhanced their bioavailability do you think so I'm just wondering this system is endocannabinoid system is it going to sort of wake up my selves that they're going to be more receptive or sort of yeah I'm just wondering is there going to be a synergy by taking this in combination with other supplements for example I think it CBD is essential that you're taking in Omega threes Omega threes are part of actually are incorporated in the endocannabinoid system they're modified and that's what their real benefit is and so combining them is really important but the to work synergistically and getting better effects in in other types of supplements you know I I think it's important that we supplement with vitamin d3 because we're just not getting the amount of sunshine that we need to the other is iodine we need to be taking that in a popular culinary approach is to take salt and take that the not include the iodine for taste factors but if we're not getting iodine from some source like kelp or seaweed then we're really missing on the essential need for iodine within our bodies it does appear to complement some in some diets particularly a ketogenic diet because it it looks like the two mechanisms seem to overlap and to amplify the benefits from both of those processes right down to the level of the mitochondria and shifting the metabolism in the mitochondria making it more efficient and less reactive oxygen species that will cause inflammation so your top tip earlier was taking a fish oil a good omega-3 oil with your CBD because they those two seem to work very well together and but since you brought up the ketogenic diet and working together that's what it takes me into that the the concept that CBD oil has has made the headlines purpose of recently in the UK with mother who had I don't know if it was just CBD or maybe in CBD plus THC I'm not aware but she had the government basically confiscated from her at the airport and her son required it to stop his seizures and you know they've made the headline news and everything here but when I did my geeking out and research about it I was just blown away like how effective it is for seizure control I mean children who are seizuring every 20 to 30 minutes you give them this oil and suddenly they can become seizure free it's just it's incredible and that you know and that's why I got interested in the ketogenic diet too about seizure control so I guess my first question is that as you said about the synergy between the two do you think there is a neurological like a brain benefit if someone was using heterogenic diet to have better neurology better brain health and taking CBD like the two together the ketones plus the CBD are going to just really help heal your brain well I do I mean I think there's pretty good evidence for it we know that the ketogenic diet has been used for centuries and we just haven't recognized it the number one has been talked about for weight loss and in the mid-1800s but it's also been very effective for diabetes epilepsy as we talked about but there's also evidence for multiple sclerosis in you and Alzheimer's disease and autism I mean all of these conditions respond to a high fat type of diet low carbohydrate um it turns out that when we make ketones we actually signal the body in certain ways we reduce inflammation the signaling of ketones goes right down to the mitochondrial level and to the DNA and modulating and epigenetic changes to the jinnee DNA to shift it to an anti-inflammatory manifestation within the body within the brain it does seem to improve functioning of the brain as I mentioned with MS and Alzheimer's and aunt too and it's using some rather unique pathways and it turns out that CBD CBD is actually working on some of those same pathways so you really are amplifying the maximum benefits that really a fret affect the cognizance the the clarity of both the thought process as well as what I've seen is actually visual improvements that that go along with gamma dial yeah and so you know but I was talking the extreme cases like I watched in the Ted TED talks with the seizure control but you know I think there are going to be a group of people who are on a low carb or ketogenic diet for just general preventing brain fog and just general well-being and that cognition effect you know I want to think well as I get older to and protect my brain health and so you're saying that here you think it would be good to sort of take like a maintenance dose of CBD oil if you want to also protect your brain for the long term I do I think it's essential for diabetics too but you we have inflammation in our body that gets turned on and doesn't turn off we've got to control that inflammation otherwise we lead to things like Alzheimer's and dementia or Parkinson's disease or diabetes worsening diabetes or kidney disease and eye disease all of these things have a basis for as inflammation within the body using CBD could regulate down play down regulate the inflammatory in the immune system such that we don't face those complications I mean a classic is atherosclerosis that is inflammation within the blood vessels and around the blood vessels if we could stop that process based on and based on what I've read and I've looked at it the CBD could stop that particular process and block atherosclerosis in the body and prevent heart attacks as well as preventing stroke okay so the main mechanism here that people will be benefiting from Suns like all these receptors are getting stimulated by by taking in the CBD oil and it's this massive body-wide anti-inflammatory effect that's going from your blood vessels you know near your heart to the back of your eye to in your muscle is and that I guess that comes into where the reported benefits of it art is for things like pain control and and joint pains too because it's that anti-inflammatory effect well that's part of it but it's also the neurotransmitters we have a mechanism where we we respond to a stimulus of some sort we released neurotransmitters the cannabinoid the natural endocannabinoid receptors are there that actually signal the the cell that is releasing the neurotransmitter to signal it to turn down the volume decrease the amount and it's called retrograde type of stimulation and modulation so it turns down the amount of neurotransmitters that are being produced and it reduces that the height and the intensity that's going on so it regulates and it's supposed to modulate the body in a proper way and and I want to just go back to something you said that you talked about stimulating the body it's not always stimulation sometimes it's blocking no it's quite a concert in terms of stimulating on this side and and depressing some other areas and so that's why I like to use the term modulation and so if you've got the endocannabinoid system being modulated and regulated then you can get closer to homeostasis and get away from these extreme cases where you have inflammation or you have irritation and you brought up a really good point about pain so particularly pain there's really two components you have the analgesic effect so this that's neurotransmitters that are going on but you also have the inflammatory phase where you have macrophages that are going into an area that are releasing cytotoxins or cytokines that are irritating and promote inflammation so CBD is actually working on both those lines number one you get that handle jisuk effect from the at the neurotransmitter level and then after a couple days you're really moving into the anti inflammatory area so that you're going to stop the inflammation that's going to lead to disease progression fibrosis and other damage to the organs and so that's small at the at the sites of damage so if you cut yourself at that area there's a whole lot of chemical activity going on like a chemical soup and that exactly and I did read I believe there was a study that was even looking at sciatica so this is now your nerve pathways from your spinal cord down the route and even in those cases there was a benefit from what I if I think I did did read up properly but that's that would also be amazing that we're looking at like central pain pathway so within the spinal cord and the neurology is is is is that been studied yeah I don't know if that is true what I want to read oh well it's being studied but unfortunately there are issues with getting the studies done in humans and and many of the review boards have not allowed human studies and having difficulty getting particular products it's being looked at it's been looked at in animals and there's a lot of what we call preclinical studies but there's not very many that are going on in humans everybody's waiting for a pharmaceutical product to be produced but typically a pharmaceutical products are isolates they're dealing with just cannabidiol and as we talked about before you really need a full spectrum in order to get the balance that you would like to have and the enhancement from the other substances that are located with the cannabidiol hmm and when you were mentioning earlier that when you when you ingested it's going to stimulate or raise the activity of certain chemicals but your bodies also can potentially use it to dampen or quiet down certain chemicals and that's just amazing to hear again that so we're taking this substance in and it is helping regulates helping at homeostasis that their balance that fine balance the body is always trying to and again just to think it's doing that over many systems you know cardiovascular system hormone system gut system so many systems which trying to allow the body to go right okay I'm I'm making too much of this or no I need an ad the tissue level right down to the cellular level so for instance CBD is an excellent anti-inflammatory great the terrific anti form and it'll protect the normal cell from damage as a result of toxins of heavy metals or from injury from chemicals but at the same time if we're dealing with certain types of cells like cancer cells it kills and it promotes the death of cancer cells it an amazing intelligence some people call it an adaptogen something that adapts to the particular situation and Institute and the right kind of response that we need for homeostasis maintaining balance in the body and maintaining health and when I watch that documentary I mentioned earlier the scientist that was the one study was brought up there about how effective it was for children who are undergoing cancer treatment and they just didn't have the the massive negative side effects so in that case their oncologist the cancer doctor was giving them CBD oil and she knew which was placebo or not is what they said in the documentary because she knew like oh wow this this group is just not vomiting and they're not going through all these terrible side effects but this group still is so she she said she needed mmediately which group was taking CBD so wasn't completely like randomized double-blind but it's much more than just um you know holding controlling the symptoms what I've seen in a number of patients is an enhancement of the killing effects of the chemotherapy along with the CBD as well as protecting the normal tissues I've had dozens of patients with cancer using cannabis aisle I really promote people using it during the time they have chemo or radiation because it's going to protect the normal tissues against those side effects with those side effects but also the tissue the normal tissue and it's going to enhance the killing effect of the cancer out of the chemotherapy on the results so is it accepted by oncologists are they either recommending it or they're happy for patients to take CBD oil I don't know of any who are recommending or are using I'm trying to get my foot in the door and talk with them about my experience but so often they're looking for double-blind controlled studies that which are very hard to produce and really require a pharmaceutical company with the deep pockets in order to do the kind of studies that they would be looking for on the other hand I try to I talk to patients and I try to empower them with the understanding that this these substances are food products and that they're safe they don't they're not toxic they don't have any significant adverse effects to them so that if they're taking a food nobody's really going to object to the food result with using a food and try to empower patients so that they are doing the research finding out from themselves for themselves and maybe bring in and definitely bring it up with their doctor but not succumbing to the the negative information that might come from a lot of physicians particularly even in the oncology area unless they feel that there is some sort of possible interaction but even then I've not seen a negative interaction with oncology and with the chemo and radiation therapy that of any concern on the other hand I've seen some great remissions people doing very very well recovering and maintaining a remission for a number of years well any patients are a little bit concerned or cancellations I guess they can maybe somehow contact you just to find out for some more information because yes people then that's why I went sit interview you know it's people like yourself to help to educate listeners and to educate people who are on the Hunts they're on their own ending equals one sort of research discovery of what they want to do with their own body and their own health so we've talked about seizures we've talked about cancer I mean these are all you know big medical events - and that another common one which you already touched on earlier was the SSRIs you know the antidepressant drugs so I see a another common form that why people want to take it is for anxiety and depression and you would say that it is good if you if you're prone to to those symptoms then a dose of CBD oil will be a part of your journey to help you recover oh absolutely you know I love to talk to people with anxiety because in 95% of the time I can control it and regulate it or they can using can dial and it happens immediately then I don't have to wait a while I mean they can get away from the benzodiazepines that the valium type of drugs that people are using that can be addictive and can have some significant side effects with it so using the CBD you have to adjust it according to your particular need but like with the product that you're using you probably need to adjust it according to your symptoms and then what I tell people is to titrate it or just increase or decrease the dose according to how you respond with it there is no toxic dose you can take as much as you want it is a food product primarily so use what you need to control your symptoms and conserve where you want to conserve for expenses expense wise and know that there are long-term benefits not only the immediate but there are long-term benefits that are going to happen physiologically within your whole body and yeah we haven't gotten to the dosage stuff I want to do get I do want to get into that because yeah when whenever it comes to a natural substance I always trying to think of what is the clinical dosage that's needed you know if I'm a big guy this is a small lady do we need different dosages or different situations as you meant and how we respond to it so what for the extreme cases I'm calling them extreme but you know for these children that were having these multiple seizures in a day what kind of dosage level are we talking about there so for kids and for seizures I have a general guideline of about 1 milligram per kilogram and and this is a bit of the exception I usually don't go by the kilogram weight because everybody has a different level of endocannabinoid deficiency and if they're deficient if we can replace that or modify that then they'll get back to normal however in this particular area it's really common to use the per kilogram so for most kids even adults one milligram per kilogram is a great area a great target for a therapeutic dose that I find 70 percent of people do respond to some respond less than that some respond require higher levels in certain types of syndrome they may require as many as 10 milligrams per kilogram but those are exceptional and I have only run across those on rare occasions and so it is not very very prevalent but for everybody I want them to start with and I recommend you start with the standard serving whatever is on the bottle and then but under it but but double the dose if they're not feeling like they're getting control of their particular symptoms and then double it again until they find a therapeutic dose that makes them that they can feel that they feel some of the changes it changes like a relaxation over the face and their muscles of the face irax relaxation of the voice where the voice will drop down an octave they might start talking faster they'll show some humor and conversation they'll be more socially inclined there'll be a rising energy that they'll have as well so a lot of the and there's also the analgesic effect if they're in pain you'll see a diminishment of the pain to some degree I also like to have them check their vision because um consistently I see an initial and dramatic effect with a sharpening and improvement and a clarity of the vision um as they're viewing distant objects so looking at trees and leaves in some distance out of window the colors seem to pop they go into more detail with it and there's not only clarity of vision there's a clarity of thought where memories improve a sharpen their thoughts are quicker and physiologically we also see changes in performance where they're able to tolerate an aerobic type of exercise much greater able to hold their breath for a longer period of time and diminish any type of soreness --is that you have from working out yeah so I listen to one of your previous podcast episodes and you brought up the vision aspect of lat - and you know I've only been taking my CBD oil for 710 days it's not really that long but the vision thing I actually think there's something to it I mean I've been looking into the distance you know over the summer now I live near the sea and I said I do notice that the mountain range across the ocean from us looks clear and when I look at the the fields and the animals and the fields it's there's something to it and I think you're aren't you you're definitely onto something there were you saying that it has a vision component to it so even if anything and yeah if you've got some visual issues why not just give it a try just just see what it does so you actually I call it the high High Definition mode so you go into HD into your visual now it doesn't last necessarily for all day but you do see some improvements and I've had to caution people about um you're correcting their lenses changing their glasses while they're on CVD because actually they tend to have to go backwards to their previous prescription because their eyes have improved yeah again just to think because your eyes are an extension of your brain and so here's the substance again that's helping the neurology the brain you know the retina whatever is happening in there from this chemical effect is endocannabinoid system I just find that fascinating or what we want good visual health so if you go good visual house it's it's doing something - neurology I just love that idea so but what about sleep how have you done with sleep have you noticed an improve sleep quality yeah my I would say I've got I wear the the aura ring for tracking and I would say my Bren is is is definitely better and less turning at night too so I've got two young kids and they do wake me up very early because they like to wake up early with a light but no I you know looking at that I would say to ya and more peaceful sleeps or less less sort of wakefulness during sleep and more REM are the two big things I think are basically what people report to me consistently now it doesn't put you to sleep in fact there's another one of these paradoxes is that it can actually be wake you up if so if you take it when you take it you can actually get stimulated so that you're alert your mind is going and moving but then it also improves your sleep so it's quite a paradox I ask people not to take it right before sleep within two hours because it can have that activating effect and maybe stimulate them so that they don't sleep another thing have you noticed vivid dreams this is a common affective CBD yeah and that well I think that comes into the that REM component I'm yeah my dream so I'll pretty good I'm normally a good dream or too so hard to say if that's different but you know that the data is showing that yeah REMS looking good so no sleep quality I haven't had not normally a bad sleeper but there's definitely something to it there too and I feel good in it you know my I'm so new to but that's what I'm so excited about the stuff to just as you eyes I don't know it's in seven to ten days I I think I can feel quite a nice different in my body and it's not a an extreme change either it's just this good feeling and you're just getting back to normal I mean he's getting to you you get to be all that you can be and your relationships with your wife and your children are really positive you're not blowing up you don't have the tenseness that goes on you're conversing you you want to talk to people you want to interact with people very very positive events that are happy you just you're just being human and what about what about empathy have you noticed yourself being particularly empathetic for people who are suffering or having difficulty normally empathetic because that's just my nature but you know what I would say is that so I did a neurofeedback training experiment earlier this year too and so there was also learning about meditation and and trying to put yourself in that better place you know the empathy place in the gratitude place and so you you know with meditation you're always trying to train to sort of be oh aware and know when you're being in that place and I would say the CBD oil enhances that practice so I would see a benefit of adding CBD oil with your meditative practice or if you were going through a neurofeedback training protocol we had the EEG on your head it would help enhance your neurology I'm seeing the benefits here to that effect I would completely agree I'd like to see more some studies done on it and like to hear more reports like yours because I I'm very I feel very positive about it it could make a big difference for people you know people who also with post-traumatic stress disorder have a lot of behavioral disturbances that they go on and CBD used at the same time of those experiences could block many of the adverse effects that come along with PTSD it actually blocks this reconsolidation phase that's involved with this broken record effect of remembering these little experiences at the same time they people with PTSD can't forget they have a broken mechanism for extinguishing bad feelings and with CBD that opens it up and so combining CBD with therapeutic in engagement and reliving those experiences could could dampen that block those PTSD back the effects and actually put these people into remission and so with your background in the Army PTSD is a big thing and I mean you've served in Wars too so it I don't know if you're allowed to say about is the US Army experimenting with CBD to help veterans oh and they've been experimenting with on PTA for PTSD in a number of different ways but there there is some limited studies that have been allowed by some of the universities on the East Coast particularly I believe University of Pennsylvania is doing some studies on it but there are not real vigorous studies going on and they look like they'll be years before they'll be able to be used in some way on the other hand I've got my own study that I'm doing for veterans in my area and we're using CBD and we're finding those particular benefits that I talked about where people are able to get their PTSD under major control in very short period of time a couple weeks and actually put them into remission so that are more functional in their society and their interactions and they're healthier all the way around so with your interest in the ketogenic diets who have you ever seen anyone taken exogenous ketone assault or an ester and take CBD oil so I'm just wondering if you can take an exogenous ketone and take CBD and get a little boost of some sort well I think you can nothing elaborate but looking at MCT so most of the exogenous ketones are in usually from maybe an MCT derivative and that can be used as are you using some shorter change or some saturated fats that enhances the absorption through the gut it goes into the lymphatic systems and as you know the lymphatic system doesn't go first pass through the liver so you avoid the first pass effect there's less degradation of CBD in that particular process but you're also providing the building blocks for ketones and you've got that particular benefit arm what's called the there are nuclear receptors called the P power receptors and the ketones are working on those in the developing ketones from using the MCT along with using CBD which is also going to activate and stimulate these people receptors it's slightly different variation but there both working on that nuclear component making epigenetic changes that really enhance metabolism and cell function while reducing inflammation and then with people who are doing fasting for tougher chief for cellular cleaning would you recommend they take CBD during fasting even though it might break fast I don't know or what they take it after fasting well I think it actually is in is enhance the CBD effects are quite enhanced with fasting on the CBD mechanisms seem to improve I noticed that when I'm fasting that there seem to be accentuated in terms of the particular benefit so lower doses are needed you're getting you know when you go into a fasting state there's actually a kind of a high that you you get with fasting a a change in your metabolism and you the speed of your brain processing and function probably it related to some of the ketones that are going on but but overall functioning and there's a dampening of the endocannabinoid system in in the gut and in the brain so that everything's working in in a very effective way in an efficient way and so combining those two does seem to show an enhancement and sensitivity and so you could be a major benefit and then adding some exogenous ketones or saturated fats could have the advantage of making that even more effective with the endocannabinoid system and using cannabidiol so what are your recommendations when are the best times to take it should I take it with a fatty meal or before a fatty meal or after a fatty meal it sounds like having some sort of fat is gonna help with the absorption level better exactly I believe that should be taking with fat saturated fat may be best so you get something like in butter or cream and then you but it also could come from MCT oil you're going to get an effective better more effective sorption don't have to take a lot that just perhaps a tablespoon is all all that might be needed in order to stimulate that improved absorption pathway and that you know I don't tell people that it needs to be taken at a very specific time or in a very specific schedule I mean practically speaking I like to help have my patients kind of figure out what's best for them what fits within their lifestyle if they have to go to school and they're away then they're going to be taking it when they have a chance to and I also want them to as a food product to take it as often as they need to to control their symptoms rather than sticking to a rigid rigid schedule so getting away from the idea that this is a pharmaceutical drug that needs to be taken on a specific schedule and then the combining with feet with fat some some saturated fat or some fat with a meal small meal but don't take it with a large meal unfortunately there with the relaxation that occurs where that can sometimes relax the esophageal sphincter that could allow for a little bit of reflux during that mealtime okay yeah well I've just experiment a little bit and just anecdotal stuff but taking it just before having some good coffee seems to me the coffee feel nicer too so I don't think it combines with the caffeine and it's working amplifying the the hormonal effects and the neurotransmitter effects that can caffeine stimulate hmm so when I was looking at all the different products available they a lot of it looks at percentages like I've got a 3% substance and luckily its co2 extracted too but could you just explain then as a consumer what what should I be looking for if I just won't say General Health is 3% and Apple should I have a 5% and 8% how do I know which percentage I should aim for I just focused because all the products are different they're packaged different you've got to do calculations to figure out how many milligrams of CBD so generally I'm looking at the number of milligrams of CBD and counting those and so and but it does make a difference in terms of the product because some of it is more bioavailable than others for instance the election all liposome product is is structured so that it has an improved bioavailability that maybe as much as five or seven times what you might find in an oil tincture and so you have to consider that so you start with the serving size that is recommended on there but double and triple in order to get the effect on the control of your particular symptoms you should get those effects and those benefits right away so if you're not getting those benefits you're not seeing any changes in yourself then you you've got to increase the dose or you may need to find in the product and from what I understand that it seems the best way is sublingual so underneath your tongue yeah do you get immediate effects by doing it that way I say main it is probably the most effective in through the the oral route um you get really good absorption through the mucous membranes and then then the gut is sort of second but you can also this can also be vaporized in the vaporizing delivers 95% efficiency and vaporizing there are capsules available and they take a little bit of time take a couple hours before you feel the effects of those particular capsules and then there's different forms that you're probably maybe using a tincture of some sort that's mixed in with another oil whether that's olive oil or MCT or mcg yeah that's what's on the bottle here and one other way you can use it as topically and I frequently encounter people who have an injury or burn or a laceration or painful area and I have them rub it right into that area of pain and get relief within a few minutes yeah well I actually have been doing that where I have a little mark on my skin here and after I've sprayed there's a little bit of residue and I just take dinner and I've rubbed it and I've noticed a change that was random I was speaking with my wife today but then she's like are you really seeing something I don't know you just you know you talked about your vision thing and now your skin and you know that's that that's the common thing that I get feedback is they say whiz this is this placebo effect you told me I might feel something like this I I think it's [ __ ] Bo it's it's just my imagination that these things are getting better I don't completely understand that when you have symptoms before and then they're go away after you take this food then why wouldn't you attribute it to the food but more often I get placebo that I've hypnotized them into thinking that they've made these improvements mm-hmm so it's good to know then so just coming back to understanding with the dosage why's that yeah I can play with the different dosages there's no problem I mean we're not you know the biggest dosage I think I saw but does it go up to something like 20% or 40% a tincture I mean are those only really use for those seizure patients those cancer patients is that what they need to take well there are some but I don't use I don't recommend high doses of CBD for cancer patients and the epilepsy I there are a few that have - hey take some high concentration but I always recommend a full-spectrum product and you don't usually get the full spectrum in those really really concentrated product so I'm I'm not enthusiastic about that and there's that's so rare I don't see those cases very often and but I do make I do just continue to adjust the dosage and maybe use some compliments compliments to the endocannabinoid system like the Omega threes or maybe some of the other cannabinoids that are available like baby carrier phlegm and which is actually it comes from broccoli extracts I mean correction that comes actually comes from hops and basil and oregano so it's one of those oils that we get in a lot of the foods stuff now in the study that I'm doing here we're combining it with whole body vibration so that it's a exercise stimulation that also goes into it so as part of the improvement of the individual they need to be considering all those healthy aspects like exercise diet sleep quality meditation all those things that we've known about and a good healthy diet hopefully incline people towards a ketogenic diet but you people have also had great success using a a vegetarian diet that excludes modified products that are have been adjusted or fabricated in some way so it you know this it just is good to know then so it doesn't mean the the stronger the dose that a company might sell the the better is going to be for an individual for general health they don't you don't have to think like that you can go for those lower percentages and and as you said just adjust and titrate and just see how how you respond and how you feel for whatever you're achieving so I just the last one I want to ask about is just diabetes then because that does seem quite exciting I mean I've had a lot of guests on the show who've talked about different about insulin resistance and diabetic control in there and so how does a CBD oil help someone who's got say type 2 diabetes or my question was even type 1 diabetes I was asking it some type 1 diabetes patients like with this insulin resistance do you know anyone who's taking CBD oil who's he's doing like a continuous glucose monitor check or something that what what does it actually do to their body well I dunno I have an eight-year-old child who's using CBD and he has had some dramatic improvement his blood Sugar's have dropped at 30 points he's general he's gaining weight after being depleted he has type 1 but he's in the honeymoon phase meaning that he still has some insulin production and he's been able to cut out his long-acting insulin and he just uses short-acting insulin along with a ketogenic diet because diabetes is a carbohydrate disease and you got to stop the carbohydrates in order to control the diabetes now obviously if you're taking insulin you're gonna have to be careful about that but any diabetic whether it's type 1 or type 2 should be reducing the carbohydrates to the lowest level CBD acts as to improve the signaling within the body and reduce the the inflammation and protect different cell types against damage from elevated glucose so it's protecting the eyes is with kidneys on the liver on the brain all of those areas are being protected whereas it's also shifting the metabolism so that there are actually more glucose receptors on the muscles that are active and taking up more glucose and leaving less behind inside the bloodstream there's a number of protective factors that go into this and I think that they are going to be enough to reduce the complications of diabetes that we would normally see even including atherosclerosis and you touched on that earlier about the research component and it's not really been tested in humans is this more the legality issue that in different countries that cannabis itself even if it's hemp or marijuana is being blocked at a legislative level that that's the reason these human studies aren't being conducted well in the United States it's actually being blocked at the administrative level the the current administration is blocking the law actually blocking the laws that an attempts to legalize the use of of hemp and hemp products that have come from the Congress Congress has actually passed two laws that said basically you can use industrial hemp with very little amounts of THC forever whatever you want to use it for and the Department of Drug Enforcement Agency is blocking that and reinterpreting the legislature law now they're not supposed to do that but that's what's happening at the present time and the DEA is insisting that Congress be more specific in their laws and congressmen have written the DEA said my goodness we have told you very specifically we don't understand so there's a barriers that are within the administration it's less so within the legislature is just getting those two areas to understand the the huge potential benefits for helping patients as well as the financial saving because if we substitute cannabidiol for a lot of our health care problems we would be able to take care of the opioid epidemic we'd be able to solve Alzheimer's disease and dementia we'd be able to preserve liens from traumatic brain injury get people back to work and functioning for PTSD and a host of other problems yeah well I think anyone who's been listening up to this point hopefully they're excited about it as we are and yeah I I would suggest to anyone listening to this try it out you know see how it goes I've had a very positive experience so far the the information you shared dr. Blair has been amazing you know that the documentary I'm going to share in the show notes too it's just mind opening to say that yeah this is a safe substance it's not something that's going to make you high and this the only seems are positive which you know it's like it's a no-brainer and it says just try it out see it's not going to do you any harm so just coming to the end of our conversation there what are the best ways that people can follow you keep up with the information that you share do you have any specific links you'd like to share for listeners at this stage well I forget I'm on youtube and I've got quite a number of lectures 40 lectures that are being discussed up certainly on Facebook and I do postings occasionally it's quite there's a number of followers in that area in addition I do interviews and podcasts with people like you Kerry and I'm always trying to get the word out I also go to a number of different conferences and talk to bail and I take consultations and somebody wants to do a consultation if they go through the election all company then I'm a medical adviser for them and they can actually engage me for a few minutes and a dialogue to get a protocol that they might want be using and that's the election all company is e Li X Ino elle.com and there's a UK version so they're active in the UK as well as South Africa so those are places that go and I I have my own website but it's M it has some limited information on it at dr. Blair MD at icloud.com and then probably if you want to find out more about cannabidiol one of the best sources that i recommend for people is project CBD dot org it's important that you have the org and not the dot-com in that okay fantasy and again our link to all of those resources in the show notes for listeners I just want to say dr. Blair thank you so much for the information you shared today I've been enlightened a lot I feel like I've learnt a lot so I understand more about the products and I look forward to just seeing what else it can do for me terrific it's been a pleasure to be talking with you about this amazing substance you", "o_dsXDzx9nI": "[Music] every once dr. Rick this unboxing is going to be on topical medical cannabis use and I got three things - one of which I picked up in Colorado or at least I used in Colorado when I took a hiking excursion team up there I tell you I didn't know how to use that this was a couple years ago and a married medicinals is pretty decent it is it's a pump the pump you just spray once I'm gonna pump once and it comes out has a cream you between your hands and you put it on your back and you see that you feel the effects of the menthol you might have might not feel the effects of the CBD so all of the camp medical cannabis products in Illinois have to have a biochemical profile and that essentially means that it has to be broken down as far as all of its cannabinoids and the most important ones for figuring out how to purchase what is the ratio of CBD to THC now this one happens to have all CBD so I believe it's zero THC which I'm not sure how they came up with that because it is medical cannabis and there has to be some form of THC but I haven't called the company yet anyway this is all CBD I do not think that you'll have the psychogenic effect that smokers and vapors and edible or concentrate users will have because again no THC but just remember CBD cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid cannabinoid is just fractionation of the plant in the active ingredient of the plant CBD does get to the blood as far as stimulate the immune system with cb2 receptors on the immune system and it does get through the brain to stimulate or work on cb1 receptors of the brain so it does cross the blood-brain barrier but as far as giving you the psychogenic effect probably not now I felt when I this is my story when I finished a big hike we went back to the chalet in Colorado I took a shower I put this stuff all over the Summa because I was sore from that hike or from that ascent I figured I'm in pain so I might as I'll use the whole thing so I've covered myself like a moisturizer and not a good idea because of its menthol I was cool overly cooled for at least two to three hours now the other question somebody will have is well maybe that was a CBD and maybe I don't know but I would only use this sparingly so you should essentially just pump it you squeeze it out onto your hand it does have menthol so you have to watch your hand watch your hand to eye contact and then you put it on your trigger points of pain I would use it limitedly to one spot one region one area for at least five nights or twice a day for five days whatever you choose try to do that without any other variables to see how it affects you and just in case okay for some of you who are super sensitive or using THC at night streetwise or recreationally wise you do have to assume that there might be some entourage effect between the topical that gets into the skin and your THC that you used so just be careful it might accelerate the in the effect but you should always have your rescues and that's why I have these rescues here so your rescues will be the anecdote half of a half of the lemon or a full lemon squeezed black peppercorn black peppercorn ground up I usually just take this grind it up and are tell my patients that obviously I didn't break it yet tell my patients to grind it up and then put it in the lemon juice that you just squeezed and take that in now there's no overdose of those two things so you don't have to worry about that but it's supposed to neutralize the effects of the THC essentially it blocks like like these two things these are hemp-based CBD and CBD dominant medical marijuana so both of these you can probably see and if I felt here there you can hopefully see that the content here is dominant least CBD there is some cheatsy here in the hemp based product it doesn't have to say THC CBD breakdown because it's over-the-counter so you'll just have to assume that with the amount of CBD in here that it will neutralize your Tac so what these things do THC is the part of the plant if you take it at night or you take the whole plant part of the plant that gives you the psychogenic or makes you a little high dizzy forgetful fatigued so some people that might be good for PTSD sufferers but for non PTSD sufferers or people who are older trying to take care of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia they're ready off and fatigued to begin with so we don't want extra that will rescue you it takes the THC which is supposed to be converted into something called eleven hydroxy THC another metabolite and it stops that so it'll helpfully help you get rid of your hai effect within 30 minutes I think again you can't really overdose on the natural things you can't really overdose on hemp you might overdose on the low THC medical CBD but that's the rescue should always have it around or you can just sleep it off or have a friend hold your hand so now into the topicals so we'll start with we already started with the topical cooling effect of all CBD that's Merri medicinals this is pain be gone I already opened that up so I it's technically out unboxing this is pain begun this bomb is mostly THC but here the exact breakdown and the type is so tiny I can't read that myself without my glasses so I'm squinting THC a hundred CBD zero so it's just the opposite this is all CBD all right out that you see that but if you can read great this is all THC pain begun and this is how it looks if I can open this up I just try to open it this is how it looks so that is a bomb it smells a little bit like marijuana but I'll just smell I can smell the oils I don't know this oil this is I have seen some people online make their own the only problem with making your own is that you can't have a problem with getting the exact percentages or by physical profile or by chemical profile so I don't know if it's and the THC might not be activated so you have the THC has to go through this complex process of decarboxylation to be activated you might not get that if you don't heat it properly I'm hoping that the companies have done their job so you will get the CBD product if your make it on your own through the skin but if you're looking for something else it might not get there so again this is mostly THC this is mostly CBD and finally this is lotion this is about half and half 100 of CBD and 100 of THC so this is half an F so this would be if you look at my video previous video on Ken at cannabis colors this would be red this will be indigo blue and this would be green because it's one to one if you can see that great and this one in addition to it being one to one it also hmm this doesn't even smell like cannabis smells like a spa this is nice oil but this also has Cayenne so it could be that the Cayenne I don't you can get the color of that that's kind of too much light in here maybe that you just got it but this is kind of salmon colored it smells more like the Cayenne than anything or the oil but this is hot this is hot this is neutral and this is cold so just these are options and the way I would play this would be that you use again you pick your five days straight and if you can use topical I really don't think you have to worry about even with the mostly THC one don't have to worry about it crossing the blood-brain barrier making you hide but use the red or a rescues if you have to I believe that if you do this two to three times a day if you like hot because you have a trigger point and you want to try it and try it there same amount two to three times a day for about five days straight if you want cool because you have hot flashes at night and you also have a trigger point or you have arthritis that's hot then use cooling to your area of attack but again two to three times a day five days straight no other variables to see how you effectively change and the other variables would be don't take any extra medicine take the usual but don't taint again an extra don't do anything new with your diet don't do anything new with your exercise and the same thing with the one-to-one you can potentially get a little bit because of THC content in here remember it's one THC to one CBD you can potentially get it to cross a blood-brain barrier but again if you use your rescues and you're really good you should be okay so if you notice good reflects with the use after five days of your experiment then cool you can use it anytime you want I usually use this as a supplement to my patients who are doing it orally using the concentrates orally or using the vapor smoke they'll have their protocol as far as what to do but during times of really bad flare-up I say don't change your formula as far as the vape smoke or concentrate but add this has an extra pain reliever locally so it doesn't add to the CBD that you have internally or add to the THC that you have internally it just gives you extra relief this is also very good for skin reactions those of you have psoriasis or eczema really nice I'm going to try it on a patient that has Lyme disease and is showing some psoriatic changes which were thought to be psoriasis but I really think it's Lyme so I'm gonna have him use this as well and we'll see how he turns out but hopefully you'll like this and if you have anybody that's on the fence as far as not exactly getting what they want from their oral or their smoked or their vaped and they want extra without having too much of a high affect then pass this on to them the other thing too is this can be a little expensive so you have to use it sparingly so as I mentioned I think this is for my patient I'm a caregiver for this thing is like 40 to 45 bucks this one I think it was same this one 30 bucks so they they go fast so you have to use them sparingly and again you have to wash your hands after you use these just in case you have to rub your eyes and one more thing the final note is that when you put this on topically you might still turn positive if you have a drug test so I know it you're not supposed to have that much THC in this thing or this thing but you can still turn positive now I don't think you're gonna have to worry about that but just plan on it and I addendum if you have it on your skin and you go and hug somebody that's a do T driver you can technically pass it on to them or if you hug a less than 21 year old you just got them to absorb too because they'll rub off on them technically even if it's a couple hours later can still rub off so be careful about your exposure past this video on if you like it otherwise subscribe to me

medterra's 1 000 milligram broad spectrum tincture strawberry mint flavor they uh now call this ultra broad spectrum i've tested a few med terra products in the past they were one of the first to go nationwide in cvs stores they're best known for having thc free products and my lab tests and reviews have showed they have squeaky clean thc free cbd products this is the brand that i recommend most for people that have to take drug tests because you're not going to get confused they don't even make thc products matera's out of laguna hills california remember that show laguna hills was it laguna beach a bunch of rich kids meh you're not missing much but despite being out of a rich kid town in california they're actually well priced however you guys know i'm not really a fan of broad spectrum products most of the ones i've tested in the past have had very few cannabinoids if any extra cannabinoids at all usually they're just cbd some of them have even had trace amounts of thc in them is medterra going to change my mind we're going to go over the lab test the cost breakdown the strength breakdown my taste test and what i think about this product starting right about now my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow a beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer this is not medical advice visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more please like share and subscribe to support these free lab tests and cbd videos enjoy medterra claims for sixty dollars you get one thousand milligrams of total cannabinoids but let's see what the labs say all right 1 000 milligrams claimed in lab a found about 13 more b score lab b found about 23 more c score but this is for total cannabinoids labs tests for different cannabinoids they have different testing methodologies and minimums so a b and c score is actually okay here official lab tests are here let's see the cannabinoids and is it a real broad spectrum over a thousand milligrams of cbd and shocker oh my goodness we have cbc and cbg here we're gonna break that down in a second and most importantly the entire bottle has zero thc and if medterra would have specified 1 000 milligrams of cbd instead of total cannabinoids total cannabinoids are harder to measure they would have been right on the money here a score with just what 9.2 percent more here all right let's see the cost breakdown per milligram 5.5 cents per milligram of cbd that's an excellent value for broad spectrums which are usually about 10 cents per milligram according to my 2020 analysis but can you really put a price on broad spectrums when most of the broad spectrums that i've tested have had almost no rare cannabinoids either no rare cannabinoids or amounts so low that this rare cannabinoid cost skyrockets the taste the taste is strawberry mint it's good yeah this this tastes great just tastes like strawberry mint gum or something uh it has other cannabinoids and terpenes but you don't taste the hemp taste at all which is fantastic the ingredients are just the broad spectrum hemp extract the mct oil from coconut oil and natural flavors their new update on their website for the ultra broad spectrum says it's all organic which is nice and i have no complaints about the oil it's got a light viscosity it's clear goes down really easy doesn't leave much residue in your mouth it and it tastes good so that's a plus the bottle super nice the milliliter dropper is labeled so you can take less or more the label on the bottle looks super nice it's got a little made in america non-gmo organically grown they got a us hemp authority uh certificate on the front and if you move the uh bottle in the light there you can see a little shiny broad spectrum white on white text it's uh really nice the box is really nice as well okay let's see the milliliter breakdown now medterra claims to have 33 milligrams of total cannabinoids per milliliter serving here lab a found 37.59 milligrams of total cannabinoids and that includes over 36 milligrams of cbd that's great if you thought you were getting 33 milligrams of cbd most importantly zero milligrams of thc and about 0.4 milligrams of cbc and cbg both labs show and also over 0.2 milligrams 0.20 milligrams of cbn now this this right here the other cannabinoids most other broads but all the other broad spectrums that i've tested either have had no other cannabinoids or trace levels so low like .04 milligrams like the cbl here just a trace level that basically adds nothing lab b doesn't even show that there this has 10 times that amount with about 0.40 milligrams of the cbc and cbg which is which is great now don't get me wrong some of the full spectrums are several times stronger than this they'll have instead of .40 milligrams of cbc and cbg they'll have like 1.2 milligrams the really strong ones but this may still add some medicinal value to the cbd this is actually more cbc in cbg than a lot of the full spectrums that i test i can't tell you if this is actually going to add to the medicinal benefits of cbd having .40 milligrams of cbc and cbg i mean it might i've had full spectrums with seemingly low amounts of other cannabinoids and they seem to be a lot stronger than just the cbd alone but everybody's different everyone's in the cannabinoid system and absorption rates are different so that's gonna depend on you now the 36 milligrams of cbd is a large dose up to 40 milligrams of cbd a lot of products start off at 5 milligrams they go up to 50 milligrams some of them go up way higher research uses a lot more you're just going gonna need to try cbd out and see how it affects you and how these other cannabinoids affect you personally okay that's it that's my review i'm still super impressed this broad spectrum is actually a real broad spectrum the first real good broad spectrum that i've tested it tasted super good it's from a reliable company that's it i will see you next time you wonderful person you thanks for watching please subscribe and like this video if you want to support these free lab tests visit cbdxamen.com for more info the official lab

like yeah you know for like information so you use like robots and tinctures or something that yeah yeah yeah use some different CBD creams like there's a one and one cream it's THC and CBD but I don't think it's psychoactive but there's something about putting it on muscles it makes it feel really good yeah I don't think it affects your thing really if it does it's a very very very small

think with that in your vitamin regimen [ __ ] man that that helps a whole lot it helps a lot yeah CBDs legit it's legit in terms of like alleviating soreness a little drops and shut yeah people take

injuries to the brain a lot of fighters take it like right after fights it used to be it's still questionable federally yeah like they're trying but there's some pushes to try to make it illegal just because of pharmaceutical drug companies kind of putting pressure on yeah it doesn't do anything in terms of like get you high or anything no I've actually information I actually read a little bit about that just a couple weeks ago because it controls anxiety yes and and and it's helped a lot of people with that one of my biggest one of the problems that I faced just on you know on the regular everyday is where my anxiety is like it's not because of being famous I don't know I think it comes from like your childhood you know just things that you experience in life and like what are you anxious about just general social situations yeah yeah I mean I would avoid I would I've gotten a lot better like I go I can't like I would avoid concerts even if I loved the band I would just cuz to

yeah yeah yeah like my wife she likes ashwagandha you everyone yes yes so she likes sad not take that everyone smile and I think that [ __ ] works pretty good yeah kind of keeps you calm and mmhmm yeah you know so but I've never tried I've read about when I was reading about ashwagandha is when I read about that stuff you're talking about I'll get you some alright it'll help CBD is amazing and you know it's really good there's some muscle bombs that work really good on sore joints and stuff I mean but like and nothing I've ever used before better than anything CBD just gets right into the muscles and just relaxes all the inflammation and the best part about it is it's a hundred percent natural and no side effects there's nothing right but in terms of like there's a bunch of different CBD oils you can take and just they chill you out but they don't get you high or anything right you're not weirded out but they just just calm me down right and I wonder how much that calming down is because of inflammation just reducing inflammation and just it just it seems that your body has your body knows what to do with it the body's like oh I know what this is is good yeah yeah yeah I mean I got Ted Nugent into it really man Ted Nugent before he came on here he was telling me how he's all anti marijuana and this and that and we had this conversation about it but makes people lazy I'm

off the top of the [ __ ] stage and land on the ground Blues meniscus out yeah I got him on the CBD bomb now and he texted me the other day said there's not a thing I've ever used it's helped me like

about it yeah doesn't have that part of the part of the drug my son son has it's a type of epilepsy Brendan Schaub and he started giving his kid CBD oil and it stopped the epilepsy and his track yeah I think I read where there it's been used for that for years yes yes yeah yeah for seizures yes yeah that for seizures yeah it's just a radical information decrease or it just figures out a way it does it as some sort of interaction with your body where just reduces inflammation but it's just you know like", "46nZo5gkxos": "[Music] what's good YouTube family it is your boy Dudley does with Dudley does calm man and look look I got scammed man I gotta be comes with you the boy got scared man so look you guys know if you can oh gee subscriber if you're a part of Duds nation you know that I'm heavily into herbs natural medicine holistic medicine and I love plants as you can see I got my plant beef shirt on matter of fact go cop that does calm but I love plants and one of the topics that I've spoken about numerous times on this channel is CBD oil look I'm gonna just go ahead and say it man I love marijuana I've always been a user of some sort even back when I was playing college basketball I can say that now because I'm no longer playing n-c-double-a basketball but trust me a couple of guys in my locker room they were taking much more than just some CBD oil alright so I spoke about CBD oil before and this benefits its anti-inflammation properties it helps with anxiety it helps with insomnia it helps with stress all of these things which is why I use CBD and I have been for a while but if you know anything about the CBD industry man as it's grown in popularity a lot of these companies are just trying to make money so they push out crap that's not actually CBD the marijuana industry has seen an explosion of growth in recent years and that includes the CBD industry seems like they're everywhere these days here's a little secret the industry is not regulated that's why you got to make sure that you're getting a credible source a quality products of CBD and there I said it I got scammed but it's my fault because if you guys seen the how I make my smoothie with CBD video I'll link it up here in the car or down in the description so I was using this one brand and it turns out that they changed the formula or something and it got tested and it wasn't real CBD man it had like point zero zero zero one percent and I got so mad I was trying to find another another credible source and I was even contemplating going back to Colorado y'all know how much I'm like Colorado man so I want to thank this company right here calling my wellness for sponsoring this video for reaching out to me and let me test out their products to give an honest review because I'm brutally honest here in this community as you guys know I don't do a lot of partnership at all because I only want to show you guys products that I stand behind and I never want to give you guys something that's trash I always keep it honest so I got to show you guys something man this product right here I is a CBD oil tincture alright now let me tell you about this product right here man I bet you I wonder how I look huh yeah so damn nosy but anyway man a huge shout out to call my wellness they even wrote me a handwritten card man so thank you guys over there and I'm gonna be brutally honest I like this product man I got you guys scared for a second but I really like this product this is the focused tincture right here so they have many different pilots they have the cvd gummies that also help with stress and anxiety but this one right here is the citrus and it's for focus now I wake up pretty early I have a very busy day as a business owner and athlete so I wake up anywhere between 4:30 and 6:00 in the morning and what I do is I immediately meditate and I go into my reading now what I do is I take some of this and I actually put it underneath my tongue cos that's where the body can absorb it the easiest and the most effective now I also have CBD tea and I have the topicals and you know I told you I love marijuana and I'm a huge fan of the cannabis plant as well as many other plants and roots but what I like about this is that you see with the CBD tea that I do have I have to make it first on the stove and then I have to ingest it and drink it and then it has to go through my digestive tract and everything and then be processed the same thing as taking like an edible to some day right but with this once you put it underneath your tongue you'll start to really feel the effects probably in like 15 minutes that's how I have felt it it may be 30 minutes for you but I really like the focus because as somebody that's very driven like me I'm always on the go you feel me and I mean I got around with this company because you know they from my favorite state man Colorado y'all know how much I love Colorado so I have to message them but I take this in the morning first thing I take my water and then I put it underneath my tongue what you can do if you want you can dilute it and put it in your tea as well but for me I take you straight to the head man and it's been working wonders I feel great in the morning I feel energized I take this and I'm focused through my workout I come back from my workout typically around 7:30 8:30 ish I get back to the crib shower up and it's immediately into work I'm talking to clients I'm filming for you guys or I'm doing something else I'm learning I'm reading I'm educating so I can add more value to you guys so I'm a big fan of this product they also have a sleep texture which helps with insomnia and I'm gonna lie I'm somebody that has suffered with insomnia so if this sleep tincture it's anything like this one I'm i'ma have to copy like two of those because I'm about to be sleep you understand me but I definitely mess with these guys I'm gonna link it in the description box below go ahead and cut that and tell them that the boys Dudley does sense you okay because this is a quality product I only bring you guys quality products I think this is probably my my only uh this is only like the second or third the second partnership [Music] that I've had and probably the only third part review cuz I get a couple things that literally and I mean literally reach out to me every single day but it just doesn't align with my brand it doesn't align with what I'm trying to do and a lot of these companies that make health claims that say that their product is not healthy I stopped by their website and I read the ingredients it takes me like two minutes and they have carcinogenic ingredients and they're claiming to me that they're healthy and they want me to promote that stuff to you and I'm not he'll not straight up but this is a great company I'm going to be getting the gummies very soon I'm gonna be getting that sleep tincture and I recommend that you guys do to try it out let them know that I sent you guys and keep on being the best version of yourself okay go back to mother nature for everything because she has everything you need if you're dealing with anxiety CVD helps ashwagandha helps all of these natural medicinal things that mother nature provides can heal the body can heal the world ultimately I know right now I'm getting preachy but you got to understand how passionate I am about this subject and how passionate I am about my health and how passionate I am about you guys has helped in this community which is why I bring you guys health content and many different facets whether it's mental spiritual and of course physical and food so once again guys this is calm bio wellness it's going to be in the description box below tell them that the boys sent you I've definitely messed with their products okay and I only bring you guys projects that I stand behind 100% I'm a big CBD fan I'm a big marijuana fan I hope you two doesn't flag me for being honest but uh I love plant I love herbs man and to the people at calling Bob wellness all right to Ivan thank you so much keep doing what you're doing you're actually putting out quality products that's helping people that's healing people that's you know I'm saying reducing inflammation anxiety stress you guys are healers and I don't know why I'm actually getting emotional but uh I'm just I'm I'm very passionate about this because I've watched a lot of people suffer from chronic diseases and maladies and uh and the quality CBD products can actually eight and all of those things so whatever you said me I'm gonna turn off this camera before I start crying all y'all man I'm a huge sucker for health but anyway man as always stay blessed", "51Hz5QxH2Ks": "today I am going to teach you how to\nmake my famous aches and pains bumps and\nbruises salve it works great for any kind of internal wound or pain including arthritis injury  for achy joints bruises sore\nmuscles anti-inflammatory cramps and more I like to use cutting boards as flat surfaces I am always working on the stove I have the\nindividual I'm container that the salve is going into I have some olive\noil I like to use coconut oil as well but I\njust didn't have any on hand And this is Saint John's Wort infused oil. Than we have ginger root essential oil clove bud oil essential oil sorry and some golden jojoba oil and then I also have beeswax that I buy this online off Ebay from a bee farm and then I have  my sauce pan now I because we have hard water in Arizona when I do this it kind of messes up the pan and as you can see so\nthis is become My, umm, double boiler pan that's all I use it for so I this is how I makeshift a double boiler see just\nput the water in here turn on the stove and then you can heat up the oils in the measuring cup and it won't burn them. What I have already done is I've put water in the sauce pan I am just warming that up and I'm gonna let it get warmer than I'm gonna use it so I'm\ngonna put it on high for now and I'm going to come back when it boiling and turn down the heat to medium and then I'm gonna start warming up my\noils and melting my beeswax. As you can see the water boiling I'm going to go ahead and turn that down Now while that's cooling-off gonna go ahead and take my infused oil. Shake it up real good because it had some plant  particles down here and I'm going to go ahead and use all of this.   I pour in my St John's Wort infused oil   and now I don't put the essential oils in until after after the beeswax is melted because I don't want to evaporate the any of the essential oils I don't think I need and olive oil but if you needed extra oil you can go ahead and add that and I like to cut up the beeswax so that it melts quicker and I don't\nhave to use as much I don't have to keep it on the heat as long   I have my beeswax. I'm going to go over to my water that is calm down in such a wild boil And now,  I prefer using wooden\nchopsticks to do this and we're just gonna go ahead\nand warm this up and then again this is on medium heat you do not want to have it on a high heat you don't want to be impatient  and use high heat because you'll cook out all the herbs and then all you have left is\nnothing but a cooked oil and wax   Just let that go for a while you are going to have to do this until the beeswax is fully melted my beeswax is getting melted and mixed up in there. It's about half way done. half way melted Ok, the beeswax is almost completely melted. I've got a few pieces still in here. okay now I know that I'm completely melted but I also know that they are small enough pieces that they just gonna\ngo ahead and melt before I get these in 'cause I still have a few things to do. I need to add jojoba oil you don't need much I like to add it 'cause it's really good for\nthe skin so any salves, I just add that to it now I need to add my clove essential oil Lastly you need ginger root essential oil now I have perfected this recipe down to\nthese three main herbs that you have to have you cannot make this without all three Ginger is what helps the salve penetrate through the skin and\ndown deep into the muscles and joints. The clove helps numb any pain and the Saint John's wort oil also helps with relieving pain and just soothes muscles and joints. Alright! and the bees wax is completely melted in there Now these are 4 containers I got this I got all these in a pack of I believe 10 for a dollar at the Dollar Tree they are wonderful containers for\nsalves. They also come in rectangle shape Now you want to pour it in   Now I'm going to go ahead and put this immediately in the sink with running hot water That helps it I to easily clean out measuring cup. Another good thing is to take the boiling water and put it in there;  pour it in there . Now that we have the salves in the containers We're gonna go ahead and put them in  the refrigerator. Now this is why I have the cutting board because it's a lot easier to transport\nthem especially when they're in their liquid state to the refrigerator you can just leave them out but I prefer to do them in the refrigerator and cool them off quicker and get them sealed up and ready to go. And we'll be back when they are cooled off! I just brought them out of the fridge they are done and ready to go put a lid on and put a label on for each joints bruises sore muscles anti-inflammatory cramps and more", "s8JMyVN5Fkc": "[Music] the

i will tell you that the labs did not agree with heroin naturals that's right hydrocanna is a premium skin care line by irwin naturals erwin is a big supplement company i tested their cbd oil in the past it was okay but it was a c-score from the labs they had a little little too much but overall it was a decent full spectrum cbd had a great price here i'm to give you hydrocannas lab results the cannabinoid breakdown the cost breakdown in my opinion let's drop those uh lab results right after my intro and disclaimer my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer lab results do not guarantee all products but a cbd company will test the same many cbd companies produce inconsistent or entirely fake cbd i use affiliate links to support these free lab tests these are my honest opinions this is not sponsored i pay for the products and i pay for the lab test all cbd is blind tested to give you truly independent results you're welcome visit cbdxamen.com for official lab tests and more this is not medical advice enjoy hydrocanna claims for 45 dollars you get 600 milligrams of cbd the independent labs found 12 to 19 more cbd b scores okay all right hydrocanna claims this is a full spectrum which should have cbd thc and other cannabinoids no but labs say not really let me break down what's going on here in the gram breakdown hydrocanna claims about 4.25 milligrams per gram that's a about a milliliter dose and we found closer to five milligrams of cbd which is fine that would be a lowish cbd dose for a pain cream but this is just a body lotion so that may be enough to make your skin a little happier however this is not a full spectrum the 0.05 milligrams of thc found by lab b was below the level of quantitation which means lab b detected it but they could not accurately quantify it lab a didn't even detect it at all and then labbe found some trace levels of other cannabinoids that lab b did not this is common they have different detection rates and the trace levels found here are basically meaningless this to me is just a cbd oil or topical the price the price is 6.7 cents average for topicals is about 17 cents so this is actually good especially when you look at the the bottle i was expecting this to cost way more the presentation doesn't get much nicer than this looks high-end high-end beauty something i would know nothing about but the uh this the dispenser mechanism is premium the labeling the uh opaque little top here is nice too and then the the box when you open the box there's a little nice bird that says all the magic you need oh and then the on the back side it says is inside you clever then the uh the body lotion is silky and it smells fantastic goes on clear there's a little bit of spice smell to it tiny bit of floral smell i think uh i smelled the turmeric a little bit but it smells good and it's a citrusy smell it smells kind of like citrus spice it's uh super good hydrocannon claims that the real secret to this is something called c60 fullerenes it's got some research on it as an antioxidant which is nice for skin health they claim it's been an essential part of japanese skin care i don't know about that but it feels nice now normally when i see a product that says full spectrum and then i found out it's not full spectrum i say run for the hills that's probably what you should do but aside from the lies this is one of the nicest cbd creams that i've come across it smells good feels good my skin feels nicer and this is why i tell you to pay attention to my lab results and not my opinions i can't recommend this fake full spectrum cream but i like it i'm going to use the rest of it run", "s5Lp4O8TRRI": "[Music] full spectrum vs broad spectrum what's the difference and what's better hi everyone my name is emily and today i'm going to be diving deep into the difference between these two types of cbd products the main difference between full and broad spectrum is the amount of thc that is in the product you know the cannabinoid that makes you feel high hungry sleepy and so on when the united states passed the 2018 farm bill they set a limit of 0.3 thc weight that can be found in hemp and that goes the same for cbd products full spectrum products tend to contain anywhere from point two to point three percent thc while broad spectrum is thc free or to be more specific it contains non-detectable levels of thc don't worry this isn't enough to get you high unless you take high doses of cbd like 100 milligrams of cbd at once and at a concentration of 0.3 percent thc this would be roughly 8 to 10 milligrams of thc that's not a lot but for the average person like me who doesn't consume marijuana products then there is a good chance you will feel a slight psychoactive high here is an example of a full spectrum lab report and as you can see this extract contains 0.15 thc or 1.41 milligrams of thc per 30 milligrams of cbd so if you take one serving of this which is 30 milligrams of cbd you would be taking 1.41 milligrams of thc as well broad spectrum on the other hand contains non-detectable levels of thc there are instances that you may see broad spectrum 100 thc free but from a scientific standpoint thc free means non-detectable levels of thc so there is a chance that very minor amounts are in the extract but it's not enough to show up on lab tests because it is so little and there is no chance of feeling any psychoactive high no matter how much cbd you consume this lab report you see is a broad spectrum extract and as you can see it says nd which stands for non-detectable also another crucial aspect of full spectrum or broad spectrum extracts is that they contain other cannabinoids other than just cbd such as cannabidrol which stands for cvg cannabinol which stands for cbn or cannabicharmine which stands for cbc these are only four of the 100 plus cannabinoids found in hemp also found in hemp and full spectrum and broad spectrum extracts are terpenes and flavonoids which also have their unique medicinal properties in another segment we'll be talking about why having multiple compounds rather than just cbd or just a few cannabinoids is a lot more effective so stay tuned just to recap full spectrum cbd products tend to contain 0.3 thc which is the legal limit and broad spectrum cbd products are thc free meaning they contain non-detectable levels of thc if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to reach out to us we are happy to answer any questions and guide you in choosing the right product thank you for watching and see you in the next video you", "MhrJHGTpnpI": "welcome to Kois corner a channel for personal and spiritual growth if you enjoyed this video please feel free to like subscribe and leave me a comment letting me know why a few weeks ago I did a video on CBD and how it really helped my life at a time where I could have gone down a negative path due to things I was dealing with and YouTube removed it they took it down they struck it they gave it a strike even though it's legal compound essentially without explanation which I'm currently appealing but I don't care I want to talk about CBD and specifically the benefits that we can get from CBD the science of it how it can help us because it is a magical magical compound that I think can do so much good so what is CBD well to be completely honest CBD just stands for Kenna video I think I pronounced that right which is one out of over a hundred strains of cannabinoids and cannabinoids are pretty much just chemical compounds that share the same structure the same derivatives as THC as cannabis as marijuana which we smoked in certain ways and CBD is one of them but it is arguably the most important and most practical for us so before I go any further I got this question on my last video to the CBD that I personally use is by herb strong it's full spectrum CBD a thousand milligrams for this tincture it's my favorite CBD I've tried a few different CBD types this is the one that I work with and that works best for me I don't promote anything really ever on this channel but I will promote this because it works so that's my thing so the reason though CBD is so amazing because like we said it has the same chemical derivatives as THC but it doesn't have all of it so what this means is that all scientific level we can get the health benefits from marijuana without the high CBD is not psychoactive you do not get high from CBD you do not get the munchies your eyes do not get red you don't get any of those leftover side-effects any of those conscious sort of alterations you just get the health benefits and this is why it's so magical because some people understand the health benefits of marijuana but they might not like getting high I know so many people who understand that but don't want to get high and this is the compound for you if that's the case because many jobs drug test many of us play for sports teams which drug tests we can't use these compounds who can't do this we might have legal problems where we can't do that either all these different things can be bypassed so we can get the health benefits that come from cannabis through CBD so essentially CBD is kind of like an under the surface effect or the same way that tylenol works we're taking it for an intended purpose but we're not feeling it as it acts out its own process and that process is interesting to scientifically how the CBD works is that we as humans have awesome awesome bodies so we have cannabinoid receptors in the brain and in the nerves throughout our body so when we take CBD it binds with those receptors and since the receptors aren't just in the mind but are also in the body CBD and the number one benefit which will now get into it is the fact that it is a natural painkiller it is amazing for helping us deal with chronic pain and painful issues with the body I myself got into a motorcycle accident about eight months ago ever since through therapy through everything I'd still had a slight really annoying chronic knee pain because of it that just won't go away and when I use CBD I can notice that pain disappear it's absolutely incredible which saves me for having to use opioids or certain addictive medications with side effects instead I can use something natural and safe that's one benefit that's the physical benefit but it also effects and connects to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain so what this means is that it also works for curing anxiety and depression for helping us alleviate the symptoms that come with experiencing anxiety depression CBD is amazing for this the same reason people smoke weed to relax you can take CBD and get those health benefits too so if you are having problems with anxiety with depression with restlessness of the mind CBD is an incredible place to start to see if it helps you get into that space of peace because when it does then we could try other things to combat it we can try meditation we can try yoga we can try breath work but getting into this space of clarity is best done with a friend and that friend can be CBD in this case along with this on a more serious note CBD also helps people with epilepsy kind of lessen the amount of epileptic events they have it helps patients with Alzheimer's it also works against leukemia and in certain cases which we're starting to study now it actually kills cancer cells slowly in breast cancer that's amazing so CVD doesn't just work with pain management or with anxiety but can also work with serious diseases too now the best part and I think the number one selling point for people with CBD that can be used on a grand scale is the fact that it is non addictive not me just saying it's not addictive but the World Health Organization itself ran a study and agree that CBD is absolutely not addictive in any way can it become something of dependency on a physical level unlike even marijuana which we can depend on mentally she doesn't even have in a six-week study six weeks where every single day multiple patients took 700 milligrams of CBD which is pretty much all that's in here out of a thousand that's probably 700 so imagine all of this every day that's a lot for six straight weeks a month and a half and once they stop the next day there were no physical withdrawals there were nothing zero completely fine as if they had taken nothing at all that's a very rare thing for any compound that can help the body let alone one that has no negative side effects at all really this is why she would be so great for people that have addiction problems that have this kind of extremist attitude toward drugs and I know I'm one of those people when I drink or when I used to smoke or take psychedelics I would just go gung-ho with it fully in all the way CVD doesn't give us a place to worry about that we'd also worry about addiction because there isn't any and CBD hasn't been around for just a short while it's not some new thing we're now discovering CBD was identified in the 1940s that's over 70 years ago but we fade it away from cannabis in the Reagan era with all the propaganda against it with reefer madness even before that and people got on to the opioid movement but now as opioids out numbered as prescription medications specifically outnumber the amount of deaths that illegal medications or illegal drugs I should say such as heroin crack cocaine all these different things to cause deaths first person's cause more so we're looking for a way to get out of that prescription mentality we want something safer we don't want to worry about addiction we don't want to have to worry about getting that fix or about going into the doctors and now being stuck with this drug addiction for life we want to be free from those worries and CVD helps us transcend those scares that is why if CBT is such an incredible compound not just only has all these amazing effect but also keeps us safe from harming ourselves that's incredible that's amazing I really don't know of anything else like CBD currently there are very few compounds which can have such immense benefits and so few negative traits so I highly suggest you check CBD out this is my video on CBD it's really that simple it's cookie cutter it's very straight to the point and whatever research you do you will see that it represents the same exact things that I talk about in this video it truly is a universal reality so if you have any questions or comments please make sure to LIKE subscribe and leave those down below and I'll do my best to get back to them and as always

you know well-being and just like livin life holistically essentially and I wanted to make her super super quick update today on my mental health journey I know I've mentioned this on my personal Instagram page so follow me if you're not following me already a godly afro um but I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on my youtube channel before but and I've had a history or I have a history of mild depression and anxiety and I was formerly told that that's why I have stroke had last summer in about August of last summer I believe so all those 2018 and and I wasn't really happy when I was told that and I started looking into CBT and stuff but I wanted this to give you an update on what I found has been super super helpful for my mother decide to my mud depression thank you so much to ami Maxine and also like other youtubers who have been really educating us about CBD oil this is the one I use and I got it from Holland and Barrett and not too short the Canlis very soon or not but this is a 5% CBD oil and I was using this I believe for just under two months and for me the source of my stressor is my full-time job I'm a HR advisor specialist like a senior HR advisor for massive corporation corporate environment just really stressful but and I started using CBD oil because I saw Amy Maxine and other nutri you know just speaking about the benefits of CBD oil I bought mine from Holland embarrass I think it was like 1699 I'm not to talk cause it was a it was quite a long time ago and the thing is I didn't use it for two months because my mother in Scythia my my depression went away so I'm kind of but like if it's good what's the point of me continuing to use it so actually I haven't used it since about like March of this year March of 2019 because I really feel like it's helped so much that I don't even need to use it anymore so then when I first started using the CBD oil I didn't really notice any physical sensations or changes in my body I think my head felt to be honest overall I didn't feel different I think that it tastes absolutely horrific what awful taste but you do get used to it and but in terms of how my head thought I think like the first day I used it I think my head felt a bit like mellow ever so slightly ever so slightly minute it was barely noticeable and then what I found over time is that even though my stress I didn't change so my work was the less stressful as it ever was nothing at work changed but I just found that my I wasn't feeling as anxious as I used to feel before I started taking the CBD oil so Biff previously like last year I used to get like heart palpitations I used to my head used to flick it was being squashed when I was really stressed out I used to feel like it was being squashed now made my breathing book increase that quick and rapidly that is felt like probably like the beginning signs of a panic attack I never had a panic attack before but I assume that that is how one feels when an attack is about to commence so yeah I kind of that's how I used to feel this essentially but when I started using the CBD oil those symptoms went away you know girl I was equally as stressed I didn't feel like the rapid heart breathing or I couldn't breathe and I didn't flip my head my head did look like it was being squashed you know I thought it's quite hard to explain but essentially since using the CBD all those symptoms those physical sensations have gone the way and I have not experienced them I'm actually I don't even feel as as stressed I haven't even thought stressed or anxious and it has been about I think four months now and I took it to work every single day so I used to take it in the morning and I kept it in my work bag so I took it to work every single day took about I think it was three three two to three drops in the morning before work so it had a chance to enter my system before I reached the work place and then I think on like rare occasions I used to take it at lunch as well so you know perhaps two times a day but that was only on really stressful days but honestly I use it for about two months and towards the end of those two months I feel like I didn't even need to use it anymore because I just wasn't reacting the same way to distressful situations in the way that I used to interact to them before and my body just felt relaxed it didn't feel anxious and like it was about to have a panic attack so I really truly truly am an advocate of CBD oil and and I do have some information about what CBD oil is because obviously I think this is still quite a newish being all those lots of people are talking about it I'm going to read from my phone I'm not gonna pretend like I know all of this for my heart because I don't but I truly am an advocate of anything like holistic medicine natural alternatives to you know prescription drugs and you know all of those kind of things so essentially what the research that I have collected is that CVE or is a concoction of Panepinto kind of big deal over stand perhaps announcing that film and and a natural carrier or such as hemp or coconut oil I think my one has yo- hemp to the character carrier although my one is hemp seed oil and it's a CBD or has been officially listed as a medicine by the British medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory agency since 2017 and it's legal as long as it's derived from EU approved hemp and as long as it contains no more than 0.2 percent THC and THC is the psycho active part of marijuana and its really good for stress and anxiety because it has anti-inflammatory properties and it can also improve things like your sleep and your immune system and your physical strength it helps your stress and it can also reduce epileptic seizures so sleepily oh I think is wonderful if you've got modern society mild depression or even like severe mental health conditions I think it's worth a try before you you know precede them to use in the prescriptions that perhaps your GP may give you but yeah I just wanted to give you an update on my mental health journey and also what I've been using what'd you find anything helpful hopefully my camera has not died great and my mum's back think of her in the bar in the background but yes thanks for watching this video and please subscribe if you haven't subscribed already follow me on Instagram I got the Afra and also my yoni steaming page which is called from Felicia and I will see you soon take care and God bless bye", "MoXrWX2J-lI": "hello everyone and welcome back to my channel today as you would have guessed from the title we are going to be talking all about cbd oil and cbd products i have been the biggest fan of cbd oil for about nine months now so i thought i would do a bit of a review and talk you through my personal opinions on taking it because i know there's not a huge amount of information out there and i know it's becoming more of a popular thing and people are kind of looking to know i guess the pros and cons i'm just a little bit more about it and hearing kind of like recommendations and reviews can be super helpful um i just want to clear up first of all that this is not a sponsored video or an ad or anything like that and i have been a paying customer of lovehemp cbd oil a couple of times now i've repurchased it because i absolutely love it um but they also have kindly gifted me some products recently to take some content with so it is not a paid ad but because i love the products and they kindly sent me some more as well that's why i've got two of these and i thought i would make a video and share my love for the brand so the specific one i'm going to be talking about today is the lovehemp cbd oil and i have it in the extra strong i never realized that it was extra strong until they rebranded and started putting like medium strong extra strong on the bottle but they have a different amount of cbd in them um which is i think mixed with their organic mct oil i meant to say first i am not a doctor i'm not a medical professional i'm not a cbd researcher i'm not going to be talking about the science behind it i'm sure there's videos for that and there is some research to suggest that it can be really beneficial for certain things i'm just going to be talking from my personal experience and opinion as just a 27 year old woman a personal trainer and someone who has really struggled with sleep and anxiety issues in the past but yes i'm taking the extra strong cbd oil i started taking it in june 2020 when i was really really struggling with anxiety and insomnia like i said um i've heard people talking about it for anxiety and i kind of just kept looking and thought i was a bit expensive probably won't do anything and just left it i was kind of at my wit's end i even got prescribed antidepressants to help with anxiety i took only one of them and hated the side effects and just thought what am i doing i can get in control of this on my own which isn't to say obviously drugs like antidepressants aren't needed because they can be really helpful for some people i just thought why not start trying other things so as well as obviously working on my own kind of mental stuff and i also thought i would try cbd so that's when i placed my first order with lovehemp because they always do amazing offers so it is worth hanging around for the for the discounts and i think they're really good value as well so i started taking it i'm not going to claim that it is a miracle worker and i started taking it and whoa my life changed because it didn't um but i've been taking it pretty much every day with some off periods for nine months now i think it's been nine months because we are march 2021 um and i have seen a massive difference in not only kind of feeling calmer and less anxious but also in just kind of sleeping better sleeping for longer periods of time and getting to sleep faster um i might do a separate video on kind of anxiety and sleep at some point so i don't want to ramble on too much about it if you are watching and don't have those issues but i would say that i think or at least i know that cbd oil is most well known to help with anxiety um there's lots of other benefits as well that i'm sure you can look into but that is the sole reason that i take it every day um and because i don't see any negatives i don't see any bad side effects or yeah anything wrong with it um only positives which i know you can't pinpoint to just one thing because there's so many factors in our lives and you know your mood and anxiety and sleep does fluctuate anyway um i do think that it has massively contributed to helping me just feel more relaxed and less anxious like i said so it recommends with this one to take three drops and you basically drop them under your tongue if you're wondering how to use it and i've just got the natural flavor it tastes quite earthy and herby it's not the nicest but it's not like too disgusting to not be able to do um it's absolutely fine and you just leave it under your tongue and for like two minutes and then you can just like swallow it and take some water and whatever and i usually do this at night time i think it kind of recommends trying a couple of different times in the day and seeing which works for you and but i found that i take it usually about 9 00 p.m 10 p.m kind of right before i go to bed or a couple of hours before i go to bed and yeah i just noticed such a difference with feeling more relaxed and just able to sleep better i mean like i said i'm not claiming it's a miracle worker because there's so many things in our lives that make anxiety and sleep much more elevated so it's not uh every time you take this you're gonna sleep like a baby kind of thing i wish it was but yeah it has really really helped me especially with going through a particularly difficult time with my multiple sclerosis diagnosis if you don't know about that i will do a video about it at some point um but if you follow me on instagram you'll probably be fairly up to date with that i just absolutely swear by cbd oil now and because like i said i don't see anything negative i will continue to take it even if it has now become placebo but i truly believe that it does just make you feel more relaxed i haven't even shown you what it looks like inside this is my unopened one because my other one is a little bit oily it looks like this and it's got a little dropper so you can just unscrew it and just drop it under your tongue like i said um and yeah i just highly recommend i guess i just wanted to reassure anyone who um it's kind of where i was nine months ago or whatever where you're kind of like oh yeah i keep hearing things but you know whatever just take the plunge and order it and try it like what have you got to lose like i said i've never taken it and been like oh my god i'm so relaxed and so spaced out and out of control and yeah based on my personal experience i just think it's fabulous so if you're looking to try cbd oil this is the brand i recommend i think it's amazing i'm gonna pop a link below to the one that i use and then they have loads of like different ones on the website i have tried one other brand and it was they only offered a spray one um and i just didn't get on with it at all it just kept leaking and blah blah so yeah i will leave the links below and i was going to also quickly talk about a couple of other products so i've actually already got a pack of these in the cupboard as well because sam got them for me for my christmas stocking so yeah we do order on there and but they also recently sent me these as well so these ones are gifted and they are cbd infused dark chocolate balls very very tasty um and then i also have these jelly domes which again i do have another pack of these in the cupboard i only like strawberry and blackcurrant flavors because i hate orange so i leave the orange ones um but they're really tasty as well to be fair and i can't really speak for like effects from the food products because i don't eat them regularly like it's not like i have them as an afternoon snack every day and notice that i'm calmer like i don't uh regularly eat them but it is quite cool to have a snack have it in snack form if maybe that's how you want to to try it and see if it has any positive effects but they both taste really good so you know it's a great snack and the other thing which love him kindly gifted me were a couple of their face masks which look like this i've used one of them before they come in like two separate pieces which is so much easier for popping on like because you know usually when you have a sheet mask it's one full face this is like the top part and in the bottom um and i just absolutely loved it it's a cbd infused mask obviously and i have really sensitive skin i'm eczema prone i don't know if you can i've got even excellent patches on my neck at the moment just cover it with the hair um and i was absolutely fine with it i'm always a bit conscious with trying new things it does save for all skin types and i found absolutely fine i don't use them regularly enough to be like my skin is ten times better from using them but i absolutely loved it it felt so refreshing and then my skin felt great afterwards so i'm definitely excited to use a few more of these i am trying to think if there's anything else i wanted to say there is literally like a jetty coming out of the top of my head so i've got this lovely beachy print to make us feel a bit more summery a bit of escapism i think that is everything i wanted to say in summary um i have nothing but good things to say about it i feel like it's really contributed to helping me sleep better at night and feel less anxious and stressed and more calm overall and i don't mind the taste at all i think it's really easy to use it lasts a really long time i've got the 30ml one it's quite a large one i think and it lasts months which is amazing so you're not having to repurchase it all the time and yeah i just swear by it i just can't be without it now so if you are on the fence give it a go i hope this video has been helpful and informative i know i didn't go into the science behind it but i'll link anything interesting that i find below i am uk based if you can't tell from my voice so i

"6gCrkxD7ufE": "this is a super-duper quick review of ananda hemp i think it's pronounced ananda hemp it's probably will conduct its there 300 milligram tincture first we'll go over the lab results because i sent it to a lab to see if it's really real hey you can believe the CBD companies if you want but many are lying just saying then we'll go over everything good and bad that i found on this company ananda hemp let's get to it they claimed 300 milligrams of cannabinoids our lab results found drum roll 338 milligrams this includes 260 milligrams of CBD 43 milligrams of THC and a good amount of all these other cannabinoids it's a well-rounded full spectrum extract with a bunch of other cannabinoids it's good you can see the official tests here the link to this whole page is below now the price 19 cents per milligram it's a little high 15 cents is average some go as low as 5 cents if you're cheap this products not for you ingredients look clean here's the one milliliter dose THC is a bit high for the low amount of CBD as far as the ratio goes low dose marijuana brownies like 5 milligrams THC higher ones are like 10 milligrams research shows people feel the effects as low as 2 milligrams but I would argue that if you're sensitive to THC the one milligram one point 4 milligrams may make you feel a little relaxed a little lazy a little tired we're not depending on the person another hemp is a massive company its parent companies eco fiber it's a genetic development company from Australia their largest cannabis seed bank in the world they've got a a - BBB score Better Business Bureau that's good there is one bad thing here an ABC 7 News report found one product by an and ahem contain levels of lead so high it exceeded by 100 times what the EPA would consider actionable for drinking water that's not good but it's also not as bad as it sounds first of all drinking water has an extremely low EPA rating for lead it's 15 parts per billion and that's because we consume so much water it's a bad comparison food is 500 parts per billion or up to 500 parts per billion it's a much higher amount let is everywhere it's in the salad you eat a few drops of hemp oil in comparison you're probably not getting much as much lead as you would for in something like your average burger and salad but it's still not good you don't want more lead this product still tested over the maximum for food so but for me a couple drops and the actual amount of lead you and take is not that much and this isn't a deal breaker I'm more concerned with the high price but for a lot of people this is gonna be a deal breaker okay that's my review if you like give me a like and subscribe so you can see more help me share this it takes a village to find a good CBD product okay bye bye", "R8ImocRShIk": "welcome back everyone to the Navigant credit union broadcast Center I'm go local live contributor Chelsea Jay here with our third guest today Michael paliotta from hemp bombs Michael thank you so Mike I can't even see you around all these wonderful CBD goodies with me I know you did and so you know we're here to talk about 20 19 trends and if CBD isn't one of them I don't know what is honestly I mean it's it's been around obviously before 2019 but you know with some of the new laws that have been passed allowing well recently as it Trump did sign the new farm bill and that did basically not basically it delisted hemp from the banned substance list and it opened the doorway for cultivation in every state not just West Virginia and Maine and Colorado which had already had some cultivation efforts and a lot of have been grown in western and traditionally also come on to Virginia's yeah so we it can now be made in America and produced in America and the product yeah and so it eliminates the need for a lot of the regulations that were and a lot of people's minds foolish yeah you know and so I mean it is a crazy CBD and do you think in your opinion I know like you're probably a little biased but it doesn't live up to the hype this is live up to the hype because it really does work so besides the anecdotal evidence that we have we also have actual studies that have been done and really since the medical marijuana began in California in the United States is the first time we did any real research that was considered bonafide in the 20th century on cannabis and have and also see CBD in particular so we now have you know 25 or 30 years of solid studies and not just on humans - also on pets we now know that the endocannabinoid system which all mammals share is kind of like a traffic cop for all the rest of the systems in your body can help to regulate the signals being sent out and received value different neurons and neurotransmitters and promote a general homeostasis in your body besides that CBDs eliminate pain not like drugs like hydropathy aids right which basically just shut off portions of your brain until you are either not functioning and you pass out or you forget that you're in pain okay and so what they do is they remove the pain signals from each cell individually and each neuron neurotransmitter that the CBDs act on the neurons to stop stray signals going on to can so that's how they remove neuropathy pain or the mystery pain at night from people and they also help your neurons and neurotransmitters to only receive the signals they're supposed to from the corresponding neuron okay I mean it's all it all sounds very scientific I agree but so you know my question lies in whether or not you think this is going to eventually be regulated in a way that doctors are kind of advising people on how much CBD they should take because that's of no it's you know you've got different milligrams you can kind of test it out and see what works for you but you know do you see it going to a place where where they're able to kind of determine how much you need based on your weight and pain tolerance I have to find it we actually have pretty good charts on that now and there's a lot of it's basically the same chart available across a spectrum of sites that shows you weight correspondence okay CBDs but as far as being regulated like traditional drugs doctors policy is that it's a drug if it's made in a lab and this is cockamamie because it's grown in the ground yeah so we're not saying it cures anything I'm not saying it does anything okay you may experience some benefits I personally know that I use it for pain and it's fantastic we sell quite a bit it is pain freeze which is the most amazing product it smells like Biofreeze jell-o it actually works only like 20 times stronger and from just organics so I think people are really sick of chemicals - and chemical companies running the lives of heroin Monsanto well why do we trust a company that made Agent Orange with making our food products it is stronger but one smell goes away in a few minutes and then when the smell goes away the pain goes away less exactly this is used on the boxing we do sponsor the MMA and boxing matches for CES boxing in CES MMA and the boxes the MMA guys especially love yeah absolutely which works for them like being punched in the face I guess it would work for anybody's back recently we had an event at Twin River Casino and it was a matinee because it was broadcast as the preliminaries to the UFC on an Aussie fight pass and I tell you what almost every single one of the boxers when they came out of the ring I do you MMA fighters rather I'm sorry guys came straight to us and they were like can I have some more so that's working great yeah pretty soon we're gonna be in MMA gyms and so I want to talk about you got but you brought me like a whole store here you know we talked a little bit ahead of time about I was saying I thought have bombs should be bath bombs but you were saying correctly is sort of like a fad product there's a lot of beauty products but no like there are there are a lot of beauty products like hemp lip balm and have all this stuff which you're saying correctly is it sort of is a fad it's just kind of and then also if you followed the product curve on a new product you're gonna see there's gonna be an inundation of products because people starting to see that the product works and it's very effective so everyone's gonna try and come up with a new item that's good CBDs in it I think even Matt Berger's is offering CBD shots in their shakes for like baby food is now a huge it's got a couple clubs in a Providence area that also offers a dream right yeah so and so tell me about a thing that's gonna be in and all your different seaweed if ads go well where it's solid because our products worked we're known for a high potency we're known for purity of standards and the quality organic and natural okay but we've got such a variety of delivery devices that do work so you know it's like yesterday I didn't stop making gummies my bathtub okay look listen line up better mind if I hadn't really been a racer I do this well you know I don't know I guess so you know this is all coming from scientifically produced lab food safe environments 100% natural in Florida we have 45,000 square feet that produce it so it's not like again a small local producer and we're not extracting it from actual marijuana like a lot of people in Maine and Massachusetts are now and you're finding some local people are coming out some fun local products or do they stand the test of time or not remains to be seen most of our fads yeah so tell me about what you've brought here and and what some of the offerings well I did bring some wonderful just to give you an idea we have bombs we carry a few kinds of gummy bears they want to top people people like gummies and it's an easy fun way to take medicine in the evening we've also got some with melatonin it's the blue ones and a regular strength and a larger size and then we've got an extra strand okay and so that's just like a gummy a day keeps decreases away it helps your pain and anxiety my crazy well so then when we have those days we've got these 10-hour shifts a lot of people a a lot of sports places have recently a okayed the topical CBDs yep especially us Olympics an USA judo prior to the event you're all so long to take so we've also got some topicals that are like that's the tattoo balm CBD ink aftercare and the CBDs help your healing so you don't scab if you've got some hidden anger that's a wonderful product if you've got tattoo like a lot of people in Rhode Island and suddenly we're going to do have a lot of ink the CBD product with the beeswax and it just helps you heal so much faster keeps in Chris procore we've got some oils and tinctures - you mentioned about for the pets yeah your pet dolphin is totally safe and may need a slightly larger dose well but not just anxiety so pets animals especially dogs and cats have way more receptors than humans do in their brain so sea wheedies are extremely effective if you've got the dog that eats the mailman or the cat that shreds the carpet or perhaps your pooches got bad hips and the old dogs having trouble walking and even helped with the fatty tumors - because the CBDs have been identified to work against 85% she was tested by the veterinary science at Laura our food contributor she she gives a terra dog with my dog yet but I'm definitely well I mean it's absolutely it's like new doggy yeah and it's really not new science though it's all old science and prior to the prohibition most veterinary medicines had some type of cannabis milk or hemp milk in it and if you google cannabis veterinary remedies in eighteen hundred's images will show almost every bottle says milk for the horse I mean honestly it doesn't if it if there's no harm I can't see why it's not it's not a good thing to try to see if it works for you and there there are plenty of stories can read online about about how this has helped people and two flavors this one doesn't taste like beef I wouldn't have the beef version don't eat the beet the thing don't eat your pet my it's the exact same product just there's this flavor - and this is don't worry about it so I have to ask you know what are what are we gonna see as the trends in CBD going forward now that the farm bill has passed and we can grow things more locally what are we going to local politics are gonna have a lot to do with it and I think in the next 10 years you're going to find that there's gonna be a lot of local debate in every state including Rhode Island which traditionally was I'm producer Alden on a scale of Virginia and South Carolina with the Navy in our backyard most local farmers John stands for the period because it enrich the soil I don't take the seeds feed all the animals take the stalks and give it to the government to satisfy their taxes and then they would make hemp milk for the animals all the rest of the leaves interesting humans normally had a very high CBD diet traditionally going back millennia because farmers always did that because they were it was a crop that worked but in clover gave them also a lot of honey to hum producing almost modifying okay everybody Islands maybe you have some yeah and so you do see this as being being more mainstream we're gonna see a lot more stuff especially CBD drinks you're gonna see a lot more and I think as it grows more accepted especially is like in Southern Oregon California Colorado Florida they're not a very open mind to see you're gonna see just in the most random mainstream place offer CBD shots and CBD avocado toast I read about there's all differentials and where islands really starting to latch on to the trend you can already see there's some some drinks being offered locally and people are adding it on to their menus so it really seems like something that is worth trying out to see if it works I mean depending on the elements you have absolutely absolutely yeah and you know try it for yourself some people may need more CBDs you know some people have broken bones and injuries and you know if you have neurological disorder like Parkinson's yeah see what these can be very helpful but you're gonna need a much stronger dose yeah we don't usually sell that in most stores but we do carry like 4000 milligram tinctures which someone would know neurological disorder or someone with very severe broken injuries would be using Wow okay and that's something that you guys cost was pretty fast we carried out most of the mainstream stuff our mild dose CBDs people take it exact weathers crazy bosses got your stressed out the kids just to help you even out your sleep the body accepts natural sleep rhythms once you're totally relaxed because it de-stresses your cells unlike valium and other drugs which tranquilize your brain you stay completely right Larry senses there's no grogginess you don't wake up feeling like you drank too much the nyquil the night will hangover wait well Mike thanks so much for coming on a chat with us I'm gonna try some of this stuff oh I'll let you guys know how it goes but uh we'll see I definitely think like I said there if you want to go online read about CVD there are a lot of different articles you can take a look at that you know are unbiased from from different sides talking about the impact of CVD and how it can help with different things anxiety pain etc so I'm so thankful that you came on to chat with us about this I have to say that I was at a wedding expo and people were going crazy over this wedding yeah it was like the line would never end so that's a woman's Expo yeah sorry the Women's Expo yeah we absolutely did we had a fabulous everywhere we go we have a fabulous response and it wouldn't be so if we were selling yeah make well exactly so thank you so much for coming on a chat with us about second I appreciate it and guys we'll be right back with our
