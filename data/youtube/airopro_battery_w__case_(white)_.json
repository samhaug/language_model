{"xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "VSyat0Zod40": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another bait cartridge for piyah Terry battery I would say I don't know if this is a 5-10 threading battery but it definitely looks different than your you know your typical 510 batteries usually they're like a pencil like cut the [ __ ] I mean they don't usually look like this but I mean similar and uh it's a cartridge as well and you can see I got the flavours sweater this is one of the sweaters they actually gave me it's probably like the only sweater a cat that gave the rest away but yeah I like to I like this color I got some water stains oh yeah this says AeroPro advanced vapor system premium carrying case not included but this box includes a vaporizer micro USB charger u.s. user guide and aluminum alloy body with the 320 milliamp per hour battery running it 8.5 power or 8.5 wattage power output so arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technology specifically designed for pure oils delivers superior performance and taste also has a one-year warranty as well to speak but it does say distillate so you know as far as just let's go they usually taste the same in terms of what terpenes they use when it whether it be fruity or whatever but this one apparently is Northern Lights two indica so let's just open some of these up so for uh what I mean by proprietary battery is batteries that you the cartridges only work for that specific battery I'm not saying like this is a proprietary battery or whatever like a rock garden car tree earth semi GE luck he likes to say proprietary battery a lot but proprietary battery only means when the powder you express it just like a plug-and-play like the only thing that's gonna work with the plug-and-play battery is a plug-and-play cart the raw garden carts you can use with any 510 threading cartridge the voltage might not be running as good for that specific cartridge because the raw garden cartridge is gonna run good for its own cartridges but you could still use it and that's that's what proprietary means it's it that only works for that you know 5-10 threading batteries raw iron batteries for all 510 threading so like this just make that clear you know just like he means well but that's what it means yeah and a lot of people don't really like proprietary batteries because it's like well I got to get this battery or this [ __ ] cartridge when you know 510 threading cartridges are Universal on most batteries so I do feel it but this one it kind of does look like this so it is a five strand by ten threading I believe [Music] in queen I also got my cousin on my bed back so we're gonna open this right off the bat when I took it out it smells really it smells like that the distillate like fire oh jeez from plug play like that very earth the tiny taste so I'm guessing this is just the then you take out okay hey so you charge on the bottom as well microUSB and like I said it's a 320 milliamp per hour battery so it's fairly alright I believe this one's like 400 so probably can get a decent amount of use before you have to charge it so so there is no button you just hit it and then those are light right here so we're just gonna hit it okay so you guys didn't see that because obviously you have to have like crazy-ass heists to see that but this actually vibrated while I was hitting it so you don't actually need to look at the light to see if you're actually getting anything because with this list sometimes you don't even know you're hitting it because it's a it's a very thin oil or I don't know what it's not really thin but yeah it's just sometimes when you're inhaling this lis it's sometimes you don't get the sensation that it's actually going into your lungs so the vibration is actually a good touch and I've actually seen this from Desmet before they had a few prototypes they let me try but they kind of look like this but they vibrated as well but this is the first American company I seen that implemented it so pretty good as far as the taste goes it kind of tastes like [ __ ] licorice I don't really like licorice okay you smell this real quick it's mostly it's not sweet has like a weird aftertaste I'm not really a fan of it but I will be smoking on it because until pretty I don't know I'm not a fan of licorice taste but you know like sweets I do and you like candy and [ __ ] yeah but not like one like sweet meat [ __ ] but overall I'm probably gonna try another one of these actually this is a proprietary battery I believe because this cartridge has the metal magnetic attachment stuck on it so you would have to have this cartridge to work with this battery so it is a proprietary battery in itself but overall it's a pretty pretty nice looking product not gonna lie it is running at 80% THC so it's definitely in the mid-range when it comes to cartridges and yeah I'm probably to take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it this is 0.5 as well and as far as pricing goes you're gonna probably put it in the post edit process because I don't know and there is good vapor production I'm not gonna lie that you pretty much saw all that cloud that came out other than that I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "HxaXzw59RyY": "you're hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real matty smokes and today we got another air pro

you on the next video peace", "X57hkIS65UU": "what's up everybody's a boy mastermind here wild cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're talking about Buckeye release brand new product in partnership with the company called air pro these are 500 milligram or 1/2 gram babe cartridges so let's go ahead and jump in let's begin another mastermind here [Music] all right so let's start out with an unboxing here of at least one of the batteries in one of the cartridges and we'll talk a little bit more about it as we go I'll give you some more information let's jump in okay what you're looking at is an arrow pro advanced vapor system battery which comes in a nice box here as you can see and you get a carrying case in the USB charger and user guide that's a 320 milliamp battery this is in partnership with Buckeye relief so basically you know one thing that they're doing is they're offering a one-year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the all their vape cartridges all their vape cartridges come in 500 milligram leak free ceramic etat autonomous these are designed specifically for marijuana oil in our field with the following robust terpene profile so they have three different product lines the strain series which is high quality for technical terpenes formulated to replicate some of our favorite strains the live flower series which is 100% cannabis oil firm formulated with him to ride terpenes and also the live resin series which is high-quality fresh frozen live resin for the strange series they have three different ones they have jack herer which is a sativa blue dream which is a hybrid and Northern Lights which is an indica for the live flower series they have blue widow which is a high rip purple Hindu which is an indica and super silver which is sativa and last for the live resin series they have oral Blanco cocoa and straight saws the oral Blanco is an indica the straight salsa sativa and the cocoa is a hybrid so they have a pretty good variety as you're seeing with the battery as I'm showing you here it's this one is purple but they have a couple of different colors it basically is for regular micro USB chargers you're seeing and this clear piece that you're seeing here at the top that is actually a dummy tip so you basically had to remove that so so now I'm showing you the actual purple hindu vape cartridge and as you can see it's color-coded with the blue indica label and this as you see is a live flower series and you can see the test information right there and as you can see this package is sealed so I haven't opened it yet but I'm opening it for you guys in this review video and you know I think it's interesting that they're offering a one-year warranty and they're also with the battery and a 30-day warranty with the vape carts let me know if you ever come across another vape cart or vape battery that comes with a one-year warranty I think that's a little bit different you know this particular company is it's been around for at least a couple years the box was dated 2018 so it's not a brand new battery company yes so this particular vape cartridge has a magnetic bottom so there is no thread so this will not work on any other 510 batteries that you may already have laying around the house so as I'm showing you here that you have to pull off this top piece and then you can see in there chamber there it is the magnet in there you pull off that clear piece it's kind of like a dummy tip once you clear that off then you can put the other part of the cat the cap I call it the cap back on and it won't work unless you have that cap back on there properly so at first I try to put it in without the cat pointer that didn't work out so well so you have to have this purple part that I'm showing you now all the way on there so even though it's a little bit of purple showing I actually don't have it all the way push down but once you drop it in there the magnet sucks it right into it so it is connected instantaneously even if you turn upside down the cartridge will not fall out so again I think it's very interesting that this particular VAE cartridge has a 30-day warranty and the battery has a wonder one year warranty so if you've seen another product like this in Ohio definitely let me know in the comments but I think this is the only product that I'm aware of that has a 30-day warrantee on the vape cart itself and a one-year warranty on the battery so I think that's pretty interesting so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys see what it's like for me to hit it and so here we go alright so definitely again I love the color and just to show you guys now close you can see that this is seated properly so all I do is just take a tote and right off I can taste some really great flavors taste fruity now something else I like about this is there's actually choke hold car by calm joke hold the carb hole so if you want to make it if you want to adjust the air flow there's a little hole there and that will affect the airflow that you get and so that makes a difference with the CBD it's definitely gonna have a good benefit for paying you're looking for something with pain you definitely want to get something that has CBD in it again like I was showing you an unboxing with the case it just kind of fits right in there and that's kind of easy as far as you just put your charger in there and I don't know you might take your dummy cartridge with you heck you might have another cartridge and you might have a setup like this you could have like a nice little medication pack going on I think that's cool and I like it they actually give it a little instruction menu that shows you exactly how to use the product I think that comes in quite handy and as far as you know I also have the oral blanco live resin one and I can tell you this tastes great this tastes like oral Blanco and I mean this this is one of my favorite pens so far in the whole program I love the color tips I like colors I like to the fact when you hit the battery or vibrates and like I said as far as prices goes they have three different price points 60 65 and 70 the 70 is the highest one for the live resin live resin cause a lot more to process than the basic THC oil and you know I just wanna let people know that I do a lot of reviews and I always hold on to my receipts and I think everybody in the program should be keeping their receipts and their containers just in case something ever happens you never know if this is gonna be a recall on something or an issue and since they're offering a one year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the actual cartridge it's definitely a good idea to hold on to the receipt and even here I've put my labels on the back so that's something you guys might want to start doing but definitely keep your receipt no matter what for at least up to one year and if you just can't keep paper receipts in there just want people don't like keeping that land around take a really high resolution photo with your phone or go ahead and scan it that's something I can recommend as well because that will always give you a digital record of when you buy it which you bought and then if you ever have to scrimp so you can prove that you actually purchased the item and that you paid for it so I think it's important to keep your receipt just want to touch base on that what you didn't see in me in the review was the other package is different where the alive resin it's a gold Cullen I already opened that one and that unboxing didn't go to where I wanted it to so I couldn't show you that one on camera but like I said it's very very good and it's worth every penny that I paid for it you know I definitely purchased the next the Coco one to try that one as well to see if it's just as tasty so with that I'm gonna tell you if you like what I did in this video make sure you like subscribe button I'm trying to get to

up this video cuz yeah", "Alea1MY45uI": "so here's my iPhone 11 pro smart battery case I've had this for about one month now I paid $130 and let's go over the particulars and I'm also gonna go over if I really think it's worth the $130 okay so first thing it's this is just a battery case the thing is there's already tons of generic ones out okay but this one is a smart one okay and they claim that the milliamp on this one here is 1430 and that it can provide up to 50% more juice on your phone and that is true okay usually just if I use a phone this phone here naked I get one day use okay if I have this baton the smart battery case on here I'll basically basically get one day and a half okay after this goes down to 0% basically I get another 50% juice from this battery pack alone and of course this battery pack 2 has a dedicated camera button which we'll go over in one second so here's the box that it comes in and right here and they also have for the iPhone 11 iPhone 11 pro in the iPhone 11 Pro Max and you can get it in like white black or pink and things like come in the box it's just instructions how to how to put the phone in how to use the camera button and whatnot so here's what the case here looks like kind of rubbery you can see you can see the buttons recovered for the volume rockers and the power button here here is the dedicated camera button right here and you can see the cutout everything is perfect on here you got the Apple logo back here they've got the cutouts for the speakers the Lightning port here and you can also wirelessly charge this too you don't have to have it in here to charge it you can stand alone and you can charge as you could pop this on here and you can see that it's charging when it's when it's orange right here and the same thing even if you use a regular cable you can go ahead and pop this in here and we can see that this is charging the battery case by itself another cool thing too is you can actually use the PD the cable in the wall adapter that came with your iPhone 11 to charge this as well and it'll charge even faster so of course we can charge this by itself but we can also charge it while it's actually in the phone and how you put this in just go and pop it in like that and then what you can do is just flip the back a little bit like this and just slide the phone down til it gets into the lightning port down here and then there you go and you can see as soon as you pop it in there you'll get that it'll show the battery percentage here's a wireless charger here if I pop this on here that'll pop in the lock screen here your smart battery case juice and how much juice you actually have on your phone even if you go down here and you go ahead and plug it in give this give it a second only stays there for a few seconds and it disappears okay so if you want to check it again you basically have to go ahead and plug it in like that see what you have now if you look at the Notification Center if I go directly this only lasts a couple seconds and it goes away and then if you have nothing to plug it into you have no idea how much battery juice you have left on here except if you go ahead and you'd go into your notifications here so go here and just swipe all the way to the right if you swipe all the way down you should have this down here okay so it says uh you can see the smart battery case use here and the iPhone 11 pro percentage up here this is basically the battery's widget has my Apple watch battery percentage juice on here as well the thing is if you don't have this widget down here in the Notification Center then we have to do is simply go ahead and click on edit down here and then this battery will not be there but you have to go down and look for battery click on the plus sign and that's going to move up here and then once you do that it's going to show up in a notification center right there now the thing is when you have everything charged on here it's a smart battery case because basically you don't ever have to push a button if you have one of these regular battery cases like this one here you know as soon as the you get low in your battery juice on your actual phone you have to basically like press this button here and then it'll go ahead and start charging your phone and then you know you turn off when you want to turn it off as well with this case here there's no pressing power on or off or anything it automatically knows when to start charging and I'll show you what it looks like here in the case so let me go to show you what this camera button can do okay so my phone is uh locked right now if I want to go ahead and turn on the camera I long press it this press and hold for like one second it's gonna pop up once it pops up I can go ahead and start snapping photos like that another cool thing is too is I can go ahead and record a video if I just press and hold this camera button press and hold and it automatically starts shooting video okay I'm still holding on to that button up here as soon as I let go it's automatic it gonna stop if you're actually in video mode like this and then you can go ahead and start and stop up here as well click on the camera button here start it and then you can also stop it the thing is now you can use the volume rockers to start and stop soo so start stop start stop same thing with the photos here you can take photos using the volume up or down rockers oh how much faster is it really to have a dedicated camera button well let's go ahead and see so we'll go and use the camera button first ready 1 2 3 boom is on we're ready for firing photos ok now let's go ahead and try it without the actual camera button here ok so I have it currently locked let me go ahead up with the camera on right now boom boom BAM let's see how fast it is to record a video ok I'll go ahead and use my smart button here what I'm gonna do is just press on it for one second let it open let go and then press and hold and now I'm recording already testing 1 2 3 I'm still holding onto the the shortcut camera button soon as I let go it's gonna stop okay now if I wanted to do it and we're not using the extra the actual camera button here I would have to go ready set go on boom flip record if I wanted to compare that apples to apples then if I use the camera button here I would have to go ahead and press and hold camera turns on then go to video and now click on it to record okay now I'm not holding anything I can go ahead and stop it just by pressing the camera button again like right there so overall having a dedicated camera button is a little bit faster now honestly do I think that this is worth $130 honestly I can say that I don't because I've been using both of these battery cases right now now this one here is only $35 this one here I paid 130 dollars now this Apple case basically gives me 50% more juice this battery case here gives me a hundred and fifty percent juice the only thing is it doesn't have a smart camera button or dedicated camera button nor does it know when to juice up my phone or not I have to do it manually from this button but still overall $35 versus $130 I'd rather go with this one you know I don't really care for the camera button I can still do everything almost just just as fast just from the screen itself plus I get 150% juice on there instead of only 50% now if they lowered the price maybe down to like half the price maybe $60 and yeah then maybe I would say it is worth it but for right now this is definitely the better bang for the buck definitely for me hands down see you guys in the next one bye", "QLhppSATkwY": "hey guys is Deb connection and we are doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the Z versus the Jeep NGO and the Jeep NGOs actually had close to empty so zero pro so hopefully the hits come out okay but I'll still explain to you the differences and what I kind of think is the better hardware what has a better oil and all that so first we'll talk about the hardware AeroPro is made by Cecil and it's a ceramic core but it's basically a C cell in a different format the steezy is also a ceramic core it is made by Ald which is another popular company probably the second most popular to see cell it's also a ceramic core it's the same Hardware heating element that is used in the plug play if you're familiar with that is just a different looking format the Jeep NGO I am Not sure on the Chinese manufacturer behind it but it is some kind of proprietary system that is only 2 geo it is not a ceramic core it burns off a wick well vapes off the wake Bob you've hit it light enough I don't know if you hit it light if it will burn out but I know if you hit a little bit too hard it definitely gets Bernie and if you search Jeep NGO breakdown you can see our breakdown of the inside of that and that's the only one that's not the ceramic core so these two have superior hardware I like the arrow Pro a little bit better than this TV hardware however I really need to try this again with better oil to get a fair look at those two but both these two I say are good hardware and if you want something just like the steezy but rather put your own oil in it check out the Ald V fire that is gonna have the same heating element that is the same thing that is used on the plug play the Jeep NGO because it burns off the wick has substantially worse Hardware it actually has a better form factor the battery actually feels cooler in your hand there's actually a lot to like about the Gio it's just the main most important part of it which is the core of the heating element which is essentially like your engine is not that good if they change the core in this it might might very well be the best hardware okay now let's talk about oil so AeroPro makes their own oil steezy makes it an oil and g-pen does not make their own oil so you're getting different oil producers in inside the geo pods and there's a bunch of different brands out there okay so comparing the oil to oil a lot of the people that make oil they were Pro and cz Eric low just blows it away steezy was really strong at the end of 2017 when it first came out it had a wider oil or clear kind of cut oil much lighter color and it was really good I mean steezy at the time was probably the best and or even early early 2018 weren't the best or the best when the new the newer see so hardware which this is based on has also brought up the hit strength just Dizzy's hardware it's just there oil is just so weak now essentially at this point when I have a steezy left which I got this one just to retry it I essentially consider myself like I'm out of stuff it's really just there's just no strength on this and when it comes to the oil compared to the other stuff so oil to oil AeroPro just destroys easy and AeroPro is is like one of the best brands you can find and it's a multi-state brand so the the quality on the oil is just better it's stronger it tastes better AeroPro hands-down winner over steezy now jeep NGO does have some really good oil pen makers that are behind it one of them in particular that i know of is the BAM pods from a company called body in mind and I don't know why they use the Geo it would be way better off in something else but make a very clean be hol for a vape pen that's it's hard to see I don't really see that often where there's a straight B hol card or parts or pods that you know are mixed with something but they're excellent pod so I really do like those but overall is the overall package aero pro is the winner and that's because oil is good and the hardware is good so both good hardware best oil worst hardware has some good companies that make some good oil for it though but really you're burning a wick and that's what's not good now let's do a hit of all of them you can see how they all hit and hopefully there's enough oil in there for that so hold on one sec okay first gonna hit the arrow Pro you know something's out there that say taro Pro produces three times more vapor I don't know that like if you have a really good battery like that vessel battery for example I think I don't know that it's necessarily three times more it does produce great amount of vapor the vibrating thing you get used to it I like the battery but yeah it's good now let's do steezy yeah the hardware hits good I think honest tastes easy doesn't taste bad either it's just there's just like no strength on these things and you know the last batch of these so the end of 2017 they're great you know early 2018 they're pretty good mid 2018 they just got super weak and I was like you know maybe this is just this batch I got six of them I thought maybe they're fake or something I wouldn't got another one this is that pure light from Placerville so I know 100% legit and it's just no strength like to me like I gotta hit this over and over again and I barely get the effect I get hit this twice and that's literally better painting this ten times 100% hitting this twice better than ten times hitting this twice is better than just hitting this all as much as you could possibly hit it really just this you just don't get that much effect off it's really disappointing because it was such a good product before and I really hope steezy makes a stronger line I've heard that the reasons TZ is so weak now is they're trying to appeal more to a mainstream audience and you know maybe people like us just need something that's too strong so maybe they can do it select it like select for a while head select oil and select the lead I don't know if they still do that elite so stronger one you know Stevie you can come out with that and a 20-17 I'll make a stronger one it's gonna be a top product again no here's the Geo and this is nothing I don't like about the Geo so it actually kind of really done so at the end right here but you can just see the inefficiencies in that you know there's a lot of inefficiency it just like oil getting stuck kind of on the side and things like that plus absorbs orbed into a wick which is probably you know longer if you look at the wick with it's broken down it's definitely bigger it seems at least in the Cotton's that they use in the other ones you know take a look at fishin see here so the steezy pod is actually fairly efficient you know so it goes down there AeroPro that's really efficient so started to efficiency in there let's see if this works the other thing to the G pod the Geo pods are real actually really tricky sometimes and see look now it's not working so I actually got to do my fix and this happens quite often they get stock I just suck from the other side to make the airflow go and then it'll work I'm gonna pause doesn't be difficult if I gotta put paperclip in there okay so I broke the air through now let's put this pot on so the G the G low hits good bet if I take way too big of a hit it's just going to get super Burnie and that's kind of that's kind of a down point but that that well from bama is very good they got great oil I hope I hope Gio makes this core better and they got a solid solid solid product steezy go back to them to 2017 oil and you got a solid solid product AeroPro is a very very solid product and one of the best base you're gonna get anywhere and you can go get them in multiple states which is also a plus so there's my comparison arrow Poe versus TZ versus Geo intro Pro clear winner on all fronts steezy still great hardware Geo good oil makers needs improvement thanks for watching guys have a great week", "RBae2GpGyiI": "what's up guys is why pose I'm back with another little video but this rig is gonna be so quick because now I'm gonna lie I kind of ran out of video ideas so this video is just gonna be like another part two of how to hit you got down cart without a battery if you don't got a battery or if you do have a battery but the battery doesn't work or if it doesn't

enjoy", "APKXe_Fii-k": "hey guys his nap connection we're doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the vessel battery and we're gonna be using an actual C cell on the vessel battery so a couple things I should mention the vessel is getting a lot of height because it's well it's really nice but it is very expensive it was $99 the arrow pro on the other hand most people think of it as $35 but that's actually when you buy it with the case you may find it at some dispensaries and if they don't give it to you at first ask for it say you guys have the battery only because the battery only it was only 15 bucks and that's really not that bad I got to say overall though the vessel hits harder than the arrow pro I still love arrow Pro the quality of the oil is excellent I'll still be getting over cartridges but I do think the vessel that's harder and I'll do a compare compares hit both them here first we'll start the arrow I mean you're opposed to Hut's great and here's the vessel on a Cecil specifically on arutz cartridge actually you know also being able to hold the button here gives a little bit advantage but you notice as you get deeper into the hit with the vessel it just starts hitting harder and harder and that's why over all minutes have to say the vessel hits harder than the arrow Pro it just does arrow Pro still great still gonna get it vessels 100 bucks but I gotta say a vessel so far is the best battery I've used for cartridges and I'm primarily using sea salt cartridges and I say it's only a battery I've had that actually works better than the the Palmer Cylon sea salt carts now is it worth 99 you know if you hit a lot of cards probably if you don't maybe not I think it is a bit expensive you know $4.99 like see made in USA stuff if they could like it like just wood was like handcrafted in America or something maybe I'd feel a little bit better but the thing 99 but the reality is if you're spending 40 50 bucks of cartridge and it does hit that much better yeah it's probably worth it it really does hit nice so I give both these products to thumbs up but that's just your comparison of you know the vessel in the arrow Pro thanks for watching guys is that connection have a great week and I'll also be giving away one of these vessel batteries and we'll have info on that below thanks for watching guys have a great week", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new best dab pen compared to my last one this baby still rips it's called pulse battery $80 on dispensaries but now I believe it's down to $60 so if you want to actually I can't promote selling things

skirting my way out of [ __ ] Idaho back to the hometown Seattle where Lee ro weed is legal so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out

heart of the Emerald City downtown Seattle Washington here at Pikes Place Market and you're watching wreck rated the number one source for recreational cannabis product reviews on the Internet [Music] all right on this episode we're taking a look at the arrow Pro vapor cartridge this is a half grams distillate cartridge this one is branded as the Nightrider sugar plum I'm excited to try this out you do need a special battery in order to put this on there so there's an additional cost for the battery all in total we paid about 75 dollars for the package today so let's get into the Nightrider sugar plum and take a look at how it tastes what's unique about this indigo Pro is that it vibrates when you smoke on it so it's always gonna be making sure to like agitate the oil and make sure to get it down into the wicking system on this and also it is unique that it has this magnetic cartridge it's just convenient you just slide in your cartridge if you have multiple flavors you can just pull them out swap in a different flavor puff away you know what they're putting on the package for the flavor is a pretty good description of what you're gonna get what did it say this is a sugar plum and it definitely kind of has a plummy flavor to it this is kind of like a it's a little bit of like a plum and an apple pie or something a little bit of a pieace in there I have out a couple of cartridges from them that weren't weren't really the best flavor but for the most part a majority of them have been really good so if you want like a really good flavor [Music] all right so we're back with the final review of the arrow Pro this is the Sugar Plum half gram distillate cartridge we've been having it out all day today and so far I've really enjoyed it it hits really smooth the taste and flavor is a real good sugar plum flavor the battery life has lasted all day and there's still a lot of oil still in this half gram cartridge so you're gonna say this gonna last maybe maybe two or three days at the most if I'm just kind of puffing on it the only downside I would say is it's a little bit expensive the convenience factor you're gonna pay a little bit on there but you're gonna get a really good quality product I've used probably maybe 10 of these cartridges from harmony farms and I've never had a failure never single issue with one of these cartridges overall stellar product really good flavor I'm gonna give this one a four and a half out of five check them out the arrow Pro formerly indigo pro peace [Music]", "C_jsQRBh6Nw": "what is up everybody welcome back to stoner vibes today we're here and I'm gonna review this [ __ ] new pen that I just got it's called the arrow pro to stop the whole [ __ ] pen doesn't even look that much like look like a pen looks like some kind of like my grandparents have diabetes they have today you know like prick themselves with like this whooping it looks like one of those that's what it looks like to me because it looks like that just like a little cylinder has a little tip it is press a button phone like I need we'll just fix them so they could check the blood and [ __ ] but yeah this is the arrow Pro it's super interesting honestly was it was weird they had a promotion there where I was where I was at the dispensary I was at but here is here's the package it came in the package it came in yeah it's arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technologies specifically designed for Peter oils deliver superior performance and taste and this has like a one-year warranty included cartridges were sold separately yeah this is it's pretty cool it seems like it's made in China but yeah the arrow pro it's crazy it has no lights or anything it has a light - like in the cake when it's charging and when it's done charging but that's pretty much it like it is really I'm gonna take a pull from so you guys could see it doesn't light up or anything but here we go cheers everybody I hope you got a smoke come on tapping mom whatever you guys are doing as long as he doesn't getting high here with me but here we go everybody Cheers [Music] anything rips that's the thing that's the thing I like about it if it's it's pretty good but the thing that I think is the craziest is that this thing vibrates when you hit it like it's not like and then like an aggressive vibration it's just you know you just feel you know it just you know it vibrates it to let you know that you're taking a hit since it has no but no lights no buttons or anything like that you need to know I'm getting it so it has a culture that literally just vibrates and [ __ ] so I think that's cool I mean I guess I have in comparison I have this desire here it's a BAM oh that's a sticker that I put on there but it's strong and I just picked this up yesterday comparing these cuz I mean I guess we could compare them this one you know it lights up it has a little lights at the bottom this is a regular state everybody know is dizzy they just came out with the big sticky which is something I want to review so if you guys want to see that video hit that like down there comment below and I'll [ __ ] make a video on that but give me like this real quick cheers everybody we got some strong Hannah right here I really like this runner runner is really good it kind of tastes like smoothie but well yeah we got this ones I mean I like it it's pretty cool only there's there's downsides to it so I'll do the pros and cons on it so this right here the pros and cons of this is the pros know it's stuffy as [ __ ] like this this is all it is charges to the bottom right there yes we got this right here charging for it super stealthy it's like magnetic and it's like not even like that's all nother thing right there I guess we could compare and I mean it doesn't really make a difference but this one right here you know it's not gonna fall off it won't fall off but this one like it takes it takes quite force to like you know it's a pretty strong magnet is what I'm saying so your cartridges I'm just gonna slip off or anything what else I think honestly those are the only pros you know it oh it doesn't have a light so I mean that's why I think it's so [ __ ] stuffy because you could just hit this anywhere in the dark in the movies like and I don't think anybody would know if you just blow it down and [ __ ] and you just you know goes to hit or something but yeah this is pretty cool I like it the only the piece of these are the cons because it only comes in half grams so you only gonna be able to get this review and I didn't be able to get a full Brasco the other con is at the 40 bucks each [ __ ] halftime cartridge that's another Angus it's another Pro that it's Inc it's pretty good [ __ ] weed like I don't know where where I left the bag I [Music] threw it away but the bag where this comes in doesn't even come in like a little case or anything it just comes in a bag it just gives you although they has CBD has THC all that and the percentages the tested percent you know will they tested it out and and that's another Pro you know it's it's a good quality oil it's a good quality cartridge everything's good quality it's just that it's 40 bucks for a half gram where I could buy heavy hitters for like 40 bucks and that's a foreground I could buy a freaking brass knuckles 45 program but that's over here in Cali and where I live so I don't know exactly what what it's lucky for you to stick your in but you know I think it's not worth it for the money but that they had a deal where if you buy the cartridge you get the battery for free and the battery is 40 bucks itself so that's like easily 80 bucks just to get a half gram cartridge and abetik so it's kind of cool it comes with this case oh my god like it's a pretty cool case I bet you charge as well but has a little station where you want to put your battery you can put you up your cartridges right there it's pretty cool the display came with like a bunch of them so like display her all of them fall and I kind of thought you know it was gonna come like that with all of them like an empty empty ones just there you know but it didn't it just came with it just came with the one the battery in the and the charger and some like you know little papers inside there that were like their their brand and I think some instructions but I mean I honestly done them take a look at the instructions I think the structures are still in the box but I'll take a look at them later but yeah this is a it's it's it's pretty [ __ ] interesting it looks honestly looks weird little ass [ __ ] fanny let's see the size difference this dizzy isn't over smart [Music] honest I prefer this dizzy it's it's cheaper that could also mean cheaper quality oil I'm not sure I think it's pretty good but then again these these are 65 for full graph so it's still you're still paying good amount the only thing is that it get pays off with the with the battery because the battery is only 20 bucks so but yeah that's that's that's my review on this you know I really like that it's it's kind of small it really looks it's kind of weird so like I'm not sure if it's like it like at first I'm seeing I don't know if it's uh if it's just like a big pen like I don't even it is a kind of doesn't even look like a cannabis fan other than the color I [ __ ] I mean it comes with red once it comes with orange ones and the color I got maybe that might give away its sweet cuz it's a green but other than that I don't think anybody would know it doesn't light up like if you want to hit in the dark you're not gonna you're not gonna see a little little light but it does vibrate so it gets a good full as well like the air feels pretty good a little bit more restricted than the than the stiff but you know it's still good it gets it gets a good hit but yeah I mean compared to this dizzy or anything like that I mean I first noticed it just based on price because this dizzy is just pretty pretty simple pretty basic you know with the light at the bottom same a same charge as this one but yeah I probably wouldn't buy this one I probably not gonna buy another cartridge of this one unless like I don't know I'm gonna buy a cartridge for my friend I mean a battery for my friends so like if they have that deal again I probably just buy a cartridge and just give my friend the battery but I mean I don't know I just it's just I probably won't buy this anymore I just probably just gonna keep on use buying these or the heavy hitters but I just lost my battery so I haven't been able to get a 5-10 thread on hydrogen water so I don't know but I believe you guys it's it's it's been fun but I'm taking last hit from both of these [ __ ] until this one blinks I don't know he's never gonna stop but [ __ ] go cheers everybody I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys keep tuning in like subscribe follow me on Instagram all that jazz but peace everybody Cheers [Music] Oh God Cheers [Music]", "XyR0gPiEahE": "hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real mad he smokes and today we got another kart review for us guys and it is the Blue Train by arrow PO

cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their products here please visit NY vape shop comm if you want

welcome to the world of hot today I have another I phone related video for you I don't really do too much of these but every now and then I like to do an iPhone related video especially when new iPhones come out I do unboxings of the new iPhones and then a couple of the accessories that I think are really interesting or worthwhile I might do some some videos especially when it comes to cases or Apple watch bands that sort of thing so I have the iPhone 10's max so that is the the phone that I have and I got the Cape Cod blue leather case for the iPhone I've actually had a couple of people asked me in the comments how the case is holding up it's actually holding up pretty great I do really like it there's like one or two little minor things where it's kind of got one or two little Nick's and stuff but it's not too bad for the most part you know the biggest thing which is standard for leather is it's gonna weather uh-huh that rhymes anyways but I think it looks pretty nice uh but that being said even though I do like this case actually I really like it I was like you know what I like to sometimes swap things out I like to have a change of pace a little bit and I didn't think that Apple was gonna make this but they released a smart battery case for the iPhone 10's max they've released a smart battery case like this before but it was never for the larger phones never feel like the plus size phones so this is the first time that they're doing it for these bigger size phones and granted the battery is pretty good I pretty much always have it charged when I'm at work always charging in the car when it's at home it may or may not be charging but like you know but because it's been charging all day at least at home then in the evening it's pretty much fine but every now and then it's like you know if I'm using it a lot or if I'm going out somewhere for a certain event or something and I really want to keep it charged I had you bring a battery pack or something so this might help with that so I don't know some people don't like the design I thought it's it's it's okay I want to try it out for myself and judge it for myself so all of that to say I had a lot of intro here but I'm just gonna right to it this is the iPhone 10s Mac smart battery case it's offered in two different colors white and black I decided to go with white because I've had a black case before that was like silicone and it really caught some dirt on it and it just didn't I don't really like the way that it looked after a while so I thought white is different its new plus on my iPhone I have the the stainless steel version with the white background so I was like hey why not just go with something to kind of match it grant it even though it's gonna be covered up whatever you get the idea so here it is we're gonna do a little unboxing and check out what it's like so on the back again it shows you right here what it is so let's just kind of just jump right to it enough talking right let's you're probably like shut up just open it up and here it is so let's check it out so this is just a little thing to hold the case in place it looks like so there's that and then inside the case you get a couple different things so let's pull this right out and then and see what is inside so oh does this come off okay so this peels off there we go so standard warranty stuff I guess then it basically tells you how it slides in so it the phone slides in through the top of the case basically because there's a little lightning connector right there anything else nope that's it smart battery case yeah to remove the case you pull back the top edge so same thing there you can leave the iPhone in the case to charge it basically so alright so anyways let's move this out of the way and let's take a look at the actual case right here here it is is that part of the the case I guess so very interesting so I don't know which one is going to catch more dirt and stuff I tried the black one I don't really like it I feel like white might catch more dirt but I looked online some people that have the silicone case said that like it didn't really yellow and stuff I don't know I like you know what I'm gonna try it out let's see what how it goes it's an spearmint an expensive experiment because this thing is 130 but we're gonna try it out and see how it is so what you're seeing basically in this case is you have little button cutouts right here and then space for the mute switch on the side and they're in gray the little buttons which is very interesting the Apple logos and gray I kind of like that and adds a little bit of an accent to it so they're just being pure white your camera cut out of course you have your side button right there and then on the bottom you have the Lightning port as well as the the speaker holes right there which if you never noticed on the new iPhone 10s and 10's max at least the max don't know about the 10s I think it is the same it's not symmetrical which is kind of weird to me I never really liked that and I think this looks a little bit more odd on the case because there's not much else that you can see except the holes there I mean I'll live with it but it's it's an odd decision and yeah inside it's got this kind of like a felt sort of material it's it's sort of soft so outsides like silicone so it's got this sort of rubbery feel but very smooth feel to it definitely and and definitely gives it a bit of a grip which is nice too and then down over here is just kind of like a soft feathery your feel it's the same kind of feel that the leather case has so the outside is different but the feel from the inside of the case is sort of the same style so if you have any of those Apple cases you'll know what to expect on the inside of it very interesting design I know some people don't like it I think they think it looks weird the fact that you just have this and like part of it is not the same I mean I don't know how I feel about it yet it feels it looks okay I don't know I'm not really I'm not like I don't think it looks great but I don't think it looks terrible either it's okay to me what is interesting to me what I do like about this is the fact that there's no added chin or a certain part to it like one of the big things I've had a Mophie battery case in the past and it added like a big like a thick layer at the bottom and also it was rounded all the way around so there's extra extra weights all the way around granted you still have some extra weight right here which is probably where the battery pack is but not up top but you know it's a little bit better so I do appreciate that because it's not gonna add too much to the height of the phone which is already as you can see you know you're when you add on the case to it it's just a little bit taller but it's not it's not too bad and then with wise I mean you can already see it's about just like the edge is a little wider basically so anyways all about to say and actually the way that this design is it allows you to bend it back to take the case on and off so that's actually functionally that makes sense as well so you're gonna just sort of slide this in here and it's gonna go into the Lightning port at the bottom and then this should just slide over top so very easy oh look at that smart battery case zero percent remaining iPhone hundred-percent or something like that is what it said so it definitely adds some weights I will say that it definitely adds some some weight to it so that is going to be noticeable I I do feel I do feel that it does become what I would call a bit heavier so yeah I mean you can even hear it when you put it down on the ground it's gonna add some heft so keep that in mind if you're looking for a battery case and I feel like that goes for any battery case though it's gonna add weight to it because you have the battery involved now one of the big concerns that some people have is the fact that maybe when using it it might rock because it's not fully flat I don't know how the older cases were but if I'm using it like this you know if I'm touching at the top of the screen it does a little bit but up to right about here down it's fine it's just the top of the screen a little bit which when you're using the phone you know if I'm in here let's say I want to open the camera so it does wiggle a little bit it's not too bad because most of what you would doing is probably towards the middle or lower half of the phone not as much from the top especially for a bigger phone like this you're not going to be reaching as much to the top on the table I can kinda see that a little I don't know I I I see where that could potentially be a little annoying to some people you know it'll remain to be seen how that feels for me this video is just kind of a first look first impression sort of a thing and yeah I mean I do like the the white color it'll be interesting to see how much that holds up as well so here's the main thing about the case now that I've talked enough talked quite a lot about the look and feel of it how does it work why does this function the way that it functions right so let me to illustrate that let me grab a charger and then we'll take a look so I have my wireless charger right here I had to kind of move my filming set up a little bit so I could have this plugged in and show you what's going on so one thing I want to mention so the Lightning port still right here you can charge it wired totally fine but I would not have bought the case if it didn't support while it's charging I have a wireless charger now by my nightstand by my bed and this is the one that I have in my desk so I just plot my phone on there and it's great it's super convenient so this smart battery case for the iPhone 10 as Mac supports wireless charging so I should just be able to plop it right on and there you go it lit up and it is now charging so that right there is super convenient in terms of the the fit of the the charger you know like let me just make sure yeah there you go so this wireless charger has been acting up a little bit for me to be honest so it's a little hard to say exactly how picky or not it may be in terms of picking up the wireless charge because this one has been acting up for me and this is actually the third try that I'm filming this video and I actually took the case off my phone and I've been trying and having issues so I don't know what's going on with this wireless charger I tried unplugging it and then I think that messed it up or something but regardless as you can see wireless charging is supported on this this case which is which is pretty great so then the question comes in is this worth it I you know that's a great question and one that I don't know how to answer specifically because I think things like battery cases and stuff it's it's gonna vary so much depending on your usage of it and and obviously this is just a first look so it'll be interesting to look back at it after a few weeks and kind of see how it actually functions I will say a couple of different things having used a Mophie battery pack and stuff in the past the one thing is whether you like the look of the case or not that is subjective you can see the video you can determine if you liked the look of it the feel of the case I think the material is great I like the the soft silicon material it definitely adds some heft to the phone but any battery case will do that so keep that in mind usability of it is is still pretty good I do think it's nice having this extra little bit here and this lip does allow for a little bit better of a grip so slightly better not that it was hard to grip it before necessarily but bigger phone sometimes can be a little harder to manage so I do like the appreciate I do appreciate the added grip that does give it this odd little design that if you're touching the top of the phone and you kind of have to like I'm touching it right here and it's fine you got to put a little bit of force and it's gonna push it down a little so minor thing but keep that in mind with with a little bit of force it will sort of make the phone wobble a little towards the top only I appreciate the fact that it doesn't add much size to the phone in terms of height width you just really get this extra border around it you know you're gonna add some thickness right here for the this back part but there's no giant lip at the bottom which is really nice so the way that they were able to design this case to do that I think is pretty great the fact that it supports wireless charging is also fantastic and I do like the technology that Apple used for the smart battery case where it's going to manage everything on its own and charge the case and the phone as needed so you don't even have to worry about powering on the case or not this smart battery case will handle that for you so really it just acts as part of your phone so just imagine a slightly bigger phone slightly thicker heavier kind of phone with a bigger battery capacity that's really what you're getting with the smart battery case so is it worth it that's subjective to you so keep that in mind but those are sort of the thoughts that I have and my first impressions of the smart battery case for the iPhone 10s max so hopefully you found the review helpful let me know in the comment section below if there any questions that you have obviously if it comes to battery usage I can't really answer that right now but you know in a couple weeks or something I might try and post an update in the comments and let you know how it's going do keep in mind that I am the type of person that typically keeps my electronics charged pretty frequently so in terms of if you're asking how long the battery is going to last like is it gonna give you another day's worth of battery life I probably won't be able to answer that because I never wait for my phone's battery to go down low if I had near a charger and my phone is that even like 50% I'm like I need to charge this thing so this will give me a little bit more freedom because it'll take longer to get to that good point but keep that in mind also one last thing that I want to address there were a couple of initial headlines that were out there when this phone case released saying that the capacity of the battery was much less or the battery case was much less than previous battery case releases I want to just address that and say that that is a misconception and those websites have since issued retractions about it because the overall capacity in milliamps is indeed less however I think it was the the voltage or the wattage some part of it I don't fully understand all the battery technology I'm not gonna pretend to some part of it is a lot higher than it you than it was before so in essence it actually is still going to be more powerful because you're getting more power out of it than you did in the past so the capacity may not be as as high as in the past but you're getting more power out of it in the capacity that it has so it actually is equal if not more so powerful than it used to be in terms of how much charge it will give you so again real usage to be determined but that is the smart battery case for the iPhone 10's max let me know in the comment section below what your thoughts are thank you so much for watching take care and I will see you later [Music] you", "xpG0Vp4y8xo": "- What's up, guys? It's Justine, and today we're checking out\nthe new smart battery cases that Apple announced, and this\nkind of caught me off guard, actually, 'cause I really\ndidn't expect this. It's not that surprising\nbecause they're had these in the past, but the\nfact that they have this for the iPhone 10S Max is kind of crazy because this is huge. I've seen a bunch of memes online talking about how thick these cases are, but the reason that I'm\nmostly surprised by this is this is something that I\nabsolutely do not need at all. Like, I don't need this. If you have an iPhone\n10S Max or even the 10S, I get such incredible\nbattery life with this, and I'm on my phone constantly. All that being said, I really\ndon't ever leave the house without having an external\nbattery charger with me because there is always that small voice in the back of my mind that\nsays, \"What if your phone dies? \"What if somebody else's phone dies?\" So I kind of always like\nto be very, very prepared. I also always have a ton\nof other gadgets with me, so it is nice to have a battery pack that will be able to charge,\nlike, my GoPro or my camera. But that's not what this video is about. This video is about these\nguys and checking them out because I wanted to see for\nmyself what they looked like, what a day would look like using this. Would it kind of put my mind\nat a little bit more ease? Because with this extra\nadded battery, I feel like I probably would really not\neven think about it at all. It will just extend this already\nreally great battery life that I've had with this\nso far even further. These are pretty expensive. I've really never had any\nother smart cases in the past, but this is $130 for just one. With that, you could definitely buy\nan external battery charger that would charge multiple devices, so I guess it depends. Do you want to have this battery built in? Or do you want to have something that you could just have sometimes? Well, that was a really\nuneventful unboxing. (giggles) Here's the white one. Holy crap, this thing is huge. This is massive. Get out of your home. Wow. That's thick. And there we go; that's\nunboxing number two. All right, I'm glad they\ngive these instructions on how to install it\nbecause, I don't know. I don't think it's something\nI'd be able to figure out. Maybe you have questions, I don't know. How many milliamps are you giving us? I'm trying to read it. God, I'm so old I can't freaking see. 13.69 milliamps. That's actually really,\nthat's not very much. Like, you can get a tiny, little Mophie. Like, the Mophie has\nthese new Mophie Minis that are 10,000 milliamps\nthat are, like, super small. Okay, well, here we go. This for traveling is probably what I would mostly use this for because when I'm on a\nplane, it's kind of annoying to have to actually charge your phone, but this is definitely an option. It is thick. It is significantly heavier\nthan I thought that it would be. So the smart case did\nnot come already charged. You'd think that I would have\n500 cables lying around here. You would think. One would think. So one of the things that I do like is you'll be able to see what the\ncharge is on the smart case and on your phone kind\nof like your AirPods. It sort of lives all in\nthat little ecosystem. I just think that if you do\nhave one of these phones, the battery life, it's just... I don't think that this\nis entirely necessary, but if you are the kind\nof person who doesn't want to have to carry around\nan external battery, who doesn't have access to a\ncharger throughout the day, this could easily be something\nfor you, and honestly, I'm such a huge fan of Apple cases, like, I love these silicon cases, but the bad part about those\nis this sometimes happens. I am very aggressive with my phones. That is not new information,\nso this sometimes happens. I love, like, the felt interior, and there has not been\nanother case that I've found that I really have liked. These have just been my favorite\ncases since the beginning. Now, these definitely\ndon't protect as well as some of the other, like,\nsuper protective cases. I know I've done drop tests with, like, the Tech 21 cases before, and like, those actually\ndo protect your phones. Like, those things are\nso crazy and aggressive that it is like your\nphone is inside of a tank. But if you do want something lightweight, and you want obviously\nan Apple logo on it, these are my favorite. Not a big fan of the leather ones. I do like the leather look,\nbut I feel like, again, I'm so abusive, and they are\na little bit more expensive. Leather and I just sometimes\ndon't get along very well. I spill things on it, and\nthat's definitely not something that is covered under Apple's warranty, so I just definitely\nprefer these, so yeah, I guess back to these cases. I would love to know what you guys think because this is definitely,\nI mean, it's massive. I mean, this phone itself is massive, and most of the times\nwhen I'm using the phone, like, I actually do prefer using my 10S. Yeah, I know. Justine, do you need to have two iPhones? Obviously not. I'm just, I'm crazy. How do I get you out of here? That was something that was not covered in the documentation. Hey, do you want to come out to play? I guess I'll start charging this one. How the heck do I get you out? Oh, there we go. That wasn't that bad. Let's see what you look like in here. God, the gold is just incredible. I forgot how beautiful this phone is because it's always covered in a case. Oh, something else that\nI noticed is right there. There's a little light to\nshow you that it is charging, so that's cool. Get in there. So I'm gonna be traveling\nhere pretty soon, so I think this is\nprobably what I'll go for. I think I'll go for this look. This is a nice look, so I\nthink that this is the one that I'm probably gonna go with, but I do really like\nthis white case a lot. This looks really nice. So really to sum up, like I said, I don't entirely think\nthat this is necessary, but if you are a fan of battery packs, I just love the look of this one. I would love to know what you guys think in the comments below. And what is one thing that\nyou wish that Apple would make as an accessory for your iPhone? Like, it can be anything. Like, do you want to have\na selfie flying drone case? Like, let's think super, super crazy. I'll see you guys in my next video. Also let me know if\nthere's any other things that you would like me to cover here, and I will see you in my next video. So bye. (peacful music)", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "ps32Z5PM7Ec": "what's up guys fake earpods perot are here within a month of release of the original earpods pro there's already so many clones that have flooded the market and these are apparently one to one perfect in every single way from the originals they took about two years to actually perfect the design these it's astounding how efficient and Chinese market is at getting these outs as soon as possible so we'll take a look at these I think these are called these super copies and then there's I five hundreds and from packaging to the actual product to the software these are apparently one-to-one and I'm curious how deep that goes okay so let's take a look at that package you begin with first off the quality is of course worse and here we've got more of a gray look and not as detailed on the image but it is embossed it's a nice little touch we've got the same air pods Pro wireless charging case on the side it is reflective silver also apples packaging by the way the easiest way to tell is you're not gonna have to use a knife or your teeth to get into the packaging of air pods Pro it has a pull tab here does not the sticker is not separated into on the side it's one solid sticker here so the attention to detail is pretty dang good ok so just from the packaging you know unless you're experienced or you've seen this video you're not gonna know so seeing lots of these in news actually getting my hands on it we'll see if the pairing process is just as easy apparently this has the h1 chip inside of it whether or not it's bluetooth 5.0 it's gonna be hard to tell but ok so here are the air pods so they seem a little light I will do a little weight test they came in sideways like this not proportioned correctly to how you open the box so there's no pull tab to remove the plastic already a big difference just in the opening experience it's on the inside a defect and of course we do have our lightning to USB C cable which is a nice little touch paper tabs as well so the customizable earpieces are completely missing from the packaging one size must fit all here all right and wow I'm impressed that looks really really good and they popped up right away on my 11pro max here so that's amazing that's magic by the way this is on iOS 13 point two point three so it's on the latest version and comparing these side-by-side so the LED it it's not flush it has a little hole in it you can tell that it's not the same quality there but it's a bright green little LED same as apples just not as diffused on the bottom here lightning port very high quality looks good and this was specifically in the listing is that the hinge was mat and oh that's so funny oh no it's not it looks painted on for a seconds but I'm actually amazed that the tolerances are smaller than apples apples has a gap between the hinge this one does not also the button positioning and the text is a little darker but no one would be able to know unless you have them side-by-side so impressive work on the hinge and it feels very solid like the snap feels good it sounds really good this is apples a little deeper a little snappier I actually prefer the sound of this one it sounds more like the originals huh Wow look at that so on the inside of the casing you'll find serial codes here letting you know that it is a real product and apparently they're from real ear pods Pro but don't you dare try taking these to the Apple store let's check out the actual little bulbs and I want to do a weight test here in a second but compared to these relatively the same way maybe apples feels a little bit heavier so on the bottom here you can tell that the charging contact points are not as beautiful as apples it's taken straight from the first generation air pod so not as beautiful but it'll do the job and there's a grate there for a speaker exhaust I believe hmm definitely not one-to-one in that regard also there's text here underneath the bulb a portion next to the sensor so that part looks good and here we've got painted on sensor so this actually doesn't do anything it's just painted there's no speaker grate here whatsoever so that is not one-to-one and the actual ear portion does not have that large of a hole so I can definitely assume that the sound quality will not be the same here it does have a force sensor here but from what I understand it probably does not work I mean that's fancy piece of technology that our highly doubt they'll be able to reproduce that and do these come off oh they do huh and that's what it looks like so it's a very dinky looking exhaust hole this is the difference between $80 to 250 dollars that's sound quality there I very much do assume that these will sounds nothing like apples also wanted to see how strong the magnet is inside of the cases so if I try and fling them out oh wow it's actually really strong and will they fit each other's cases so this is a fake one it does fit into the original and vice versa so a little bit loose which hmm and it does close there it is the design really is one-to-one in terms of size but they're using different technologies for the actual sound and charging still is impressive that they were able to reproduce it in such a small little form factor okay so let's get to connecting and sound quality now I'm genuinely impressed that they were able to get this menu and spoof it from what I understand it's a Mac ID spoofing they're not actually cloning the h1 chip but it still works and it's incredibly fast so that's apples original we're not getting the same animations yet but let's go ahead and connect connect iPhone hold the button will hold it on the clones and there it is so it did connect we've got ear pods Pro showing up on our iPhone cloned and part of the listing did mention they will show up over here does show the air prods Pro charging if I pull one out yes it does show up as right that's amazing the integration is sically om okay so with that connected I want to play some post Malone let's check out that fit and they feel really good like this feels like the OEM one they're the same size they do seal off the ear canal it's somewhat noise cancelling I wouldn't say the same effects and you put in official ear pods Pro there's a seal and pop effect it's really cool until you try it you know you don't really know what I'm talking about but suddenly the world goes silent and this does not have the same effect but it is more noise cancelling than any other air pod clones that I've used so I guess it somewhat has that I highly doubt it's gonna have the integration ya know noise cancellation integration but it does show up as ear pods Pro so about half away it's pretty loud about 75% oh yeah most definitely this does not have the quality of original ear pods let me pop one of the real ones in so I'm attempting to share audio it detects them but then doesn't actually let me share audio to them they get struggling with that would have been interesting just for my little analysis of listening to them I gotta tell you the sound is not that good I mean it's clearly a downgrade it's 70% of the sound I'd say of the originals maybe 65% you're obviously not getting that noise cancellation and it's pretty clear just no bass there's like almost no bass whatsoever definitely more of a tinny sound and of course you're not getting any of the software features such as transparency mode it also doesn't show up with the little logo in the control center letting you know it's a generic earpods Pro clone so the software integration could be better but it does work it connects very fast be prepared not to get the same sound as Apple's original there's a very wide margin between those two in terms of sounds but still I'm very stunned that they were able to get this kind of sound and out of such a small package within such a relatively short amount of time so wireless charger is working as pop these see if they have a coil inside and it appears they do not also wanted to test the individual weight of the air pods Apple is five point four grams and clone pod is three point two six so Wow actually a significant difference between the two it feels lighter now that I saw the specs apples entire package is fifty seven grams almost and this one is thirty seven so twenty grams lighter I'm just picking them up yeah this does feel more solid it's a little dinky little light so clear difference there in terms of quality and before I forget I do want to test the controls for switching music it's not a press the forced press sensor doesn't work so they retain the tap function from the older clones no force press this is all a gimmick here on the side so don't expect that to work and lastly a test I want to do is testing the electromagnetic interference radiation coming from air pods and metric usually people don't care about but this is something you're putting next to your brain what do you want it to be safe apples air pods are playing and right next to them I'm getting about four volts per meter if I step away from them it drops to about two so say about four volts little over four volts per meter for point two it was a baseline of about two volts per meter next to the fake oh wow six volts per meter near the fake ear pods pro so definitely over five five point five that's insane so you're getting way more electromagnetic radiation coming from fake ear pods versus originals I don't know how harmful this is but that's two volts per meter more than apples if anyone knows more about this leave a comment but that's kind of scary Bluetooth 5.0 and apples versus whatever Bluetooth this is about 30 feet it's still holding strong 40 feet 50 feet still good straight line of sight I'm able to get a strong connection on both even at 100 feet passes the range test yes these look like ear pods Pro they connect to your iPhone like ear pods Pro but they do not have any of the features that make ear pods Pro amazing nor the sound quality so $80 200 depending on where you buy them from are they worth it I don't know you really have to want to flex on somebody to spend this kind of money I mean I'd rather just save up and get the full amounts it's just not worth it compared to apples maybe if the price comes down to like $50 sure but at 80 plus I don't I can't justify that price tag even though it's a very good clone of apples I'd still of course go for apples any day well keep an eye out for any better versions of this otherwise thanks for watching peace", "xHZIC6xh96Y": "I'm Rene Richie and these are the new iPhone 11 smart battery cases hoorah the smart battery cases are just so smart Apple originally introduced them back in the day and they confused to crap out of customers and reviewers alike here was Apple the company everyone accused of putting form over function so damn always giving their flagship product a huge old company hump but like with camera bumps Apple was letting the physics win C batteries aren't just thermal insulators they block radio frequencies as well and that meant they could waste a lot of the power they were supposed to be providing Apple by contrast kept the battery away from the antennas and then added a passive radio array to preserve as much signal as possible and because of the tight hardware and software integration Apple could also keep the iPhone in mobile mode while charging rather than plugged in mode and that meant more power intensive processes and network activity wouldn't spin up also draining the battery just as you were trying to fill it back up plus battery level was accessible throughout the operating system on the lock screen in the widgets via Siri it was an example of a couple things Apple was working towards showing how battery efficiency was just as if not more important than battery capacity and that the iPhone could stay light just until you need it to slap a battery slab onto the back to make it thick I used it all the time while out gaming and especially while traveling and I was Heike bummed when Apple didn't follow it up immediately with an iPhone 10 smart battery case in 2017 not until the iPhone 10s and 10 are smart battery cases in 2018 because of their new antenna systems Apple no longer had to keep the hump so far away from the sides so they extended it all the way out to the edges they also got rid of the chin to make gesture navigation easier same soft touch silicone on the outside same microfiber lining and power light on the inside but the Lightning part had to slide back to share the same vertical space it also got a pass-through mode so you could plug in lightning accessories like headphones and camera kits and it got a bigger dual cell battery as well as USB PD or power delivery so it could charge faster and it got inductive coils so it could charge more conveniently on any Qi compatible pad Apple also increased smarts by giving the case dynamic control over charging if you're using a macbook adapter for example and you give more power than both need both will just suck down that power and fast charge at the same time if you give it power somewhere in the middle the iPhone will fast charge up to around 50% first giving the case anything that's left and then start sharing power evenly with the case until both of them are full if you're using only a tiny old-school iPhone charger the iPhone will suck up as much as it can leaving nothing for the case until it's most of the way happy and only then starting to share and if the iPhone is already full or you're charging the case by itself the case will just fast charge by itself okay what is Apple done with the 2019 smart battery cases for the iPhone 11 then well in addition to keeping them updated year-over-year which is something I dearly hope they continue to do well into the future with all the juice Apple has packed into the iPhone 11 Series in general you may be wondering if you even need a smart battery case for it well you may not I've gotten five and a half hours of battery crush and Pokemon go constant travel use and then some out of mine and easily over a day of light usage a day and a half on the max but the smart battery case will add 50% more to those numbers so whether you're gaming camping conferencing or doing anything else that involves being away from an outlet for an extended period of time and you don't want the added weight or inconvenience of a separate battery brick the smart battery case will be the difference between running out of power or just having to stress as you ride the redzone and having enough power and panache to spare as always it takes a while to really review batteries so I'll be pounding on these for the next couple of weeks and months and I'll let you know just exactly how they hold up now back to that camera button yeah a physical Hardware camera button these days Apple is a camera company as much as they're a phone company even a computer company they make some of the very best and certainly the most popular ultra mobile cameras in the world there's so much a camera company the only reason I'm guessing we haven't seen a physical shutter button directly on the device itself is to keep Hardware complexity trending towards simplicity but we've got one on the case now you press it for a hot second to launch the camera there's just enough of a delay built-in to reduce the chance of accidental presses but not so much as it feels frustrating or like a chore could it trip accidentally if it gets wedged up against something in your pocket or bag maybe it doesn't seem likely and the iPhone has had a bunch of other buttons on it for years already once the camera app launches you can just click away on the shutter button quickly easily just as much as you want to take as many photos as you want or hold it down to take quick video unfortunately it doesn't seem to work like the volume buttons and automatically trip the shutter in third-party camera apps like halide and obscura you can still use the volume buttons for those apps but for consistency's sake it'd be nice to just have one shutter button to roll them all so when it comes to external batteries in general you can absolutely get more capacity for less money but you can't get better technology efficiency or integration so if that doesn't matter to you check out the alternatives EMAS on lists a bunch but if it does matter to you the smart battery case for iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Mac's are available now for 129 us in pink black and white alas no product red at least not yet but if they get brilliant maybe they'll realize they just simply

there's a new thing and try out I don't know if you can read it play backwards it says AeroPro a ir o PR Oh check this one out yeah so this is a battery it's Calexico and shaped and over here you keep your cartridges and you just go like this magnetic and ready to go and if you want to switch kinds from your huckleberry mango twist to your [ __ ] pineapple butthole surprise you just magnetic slip right loop and there's no light on it it vibrates it vibrates so I wish you could hear you might be able to hear it anyway I guess you could like stick it up somebody's butt or other orifice and then suck on it and it would vibrate that would be kind of cool I'm weird I'm weird for you even thinking that but anyway it's called AeroPro and it's this pretty cool thing you can hold up to six cartridges and the thing goes in there and this is the only battery on the market that you can use while it's charging you can charge you can be charging it and still use it works pretty good anyway check it out I don't know how much the cost this was a vendor gift which is one of the perks of having your wife work at a pot store anyway that was my review of the arrow Pro I guess it's a vape pen that's a vape pen it's awesome because it has magnetic cartridges that just pop out just slip in about the screw nothing until you're done getting stoned huh and then it's got this little plastic thing that goes in it for storage put this back in there like that move it up and you're on your way okay that was my arrow Pro review see you guys", "Dj4nczsbaCU": "[Music] well if guys to do slang back again today another air pop Pro super copy these are the air threes not the air 3s that I already tested these are a little different a little cheaper 15 bucks for these come in a bunch of pastel colors and I've seen them on Aliexpress for a long time so I want to check them out so here we are in the studio we're gonna check them out 15 bucks air threes this is the yellow and the mint green colorway if we open these up you saw the packaging white tip white bottom and I was a little disappointed by that I was hoping we'd get the yellow silicone tip to match the buds and I was hoping these would be mint but I guess that's too much for ask for at this price point again white silicone tips and the white bottom on here and we do have the old style connection for the silicone tips to but we're gonna connect the yellow ones and we'll check it out now these black vents on here they are not stickers and they are not real I feel like they're just part of the paint on here but they do look kind of cool I think the look but they're not going to do anything and again these have the touch controls like the air pot too is not like the real air pop rose and you can see it as yellow one blinking so these are definitely a little cheaper version of what we reviewed so far but I want to see how good a $15 pair of air pod clones was so we're gonna check it out we're gonna connect them right now and we'll start all the testing so the connector just opened early we should get that pop-up window we do get the animation we hit connect behold the back of the yellow buds and once it start spinning you can let go it does say connected on here there is a voice that says connected and there is a beep on here I'll let you know you're connected as well it's not the same beep busy originals but it is a nice nice and a beep right not loud not bad now if we back out of here we go into settings we're going to bluetooth you can see we are connected the air s pros and if we hit the button the info bar transparency off and noise cancellation and check this out in noise cancellation it says plays both air pots in your ear to use noise cancellation so that is different that's the first time I've seen that on a pair of clothes and transparency mode of course doesn't work on here you can to win and you can rename it now left and right noise control we're going to turn that off and we're going to put it on Siri since there is no noise control on here and your ear tip fit test let's see what happens in here place air pots in both ears so this doesn't even play the music for the ear tip fit test and that's you know that's what we get when we paying fifteen compared to even thirty to forty dollars in here detection now this button should work I'm gonna leave it on for now so we could test it out if we back out of here and we go into fine my GPS does work on here air s pros if we click on there will bring up the location so if you misplace them you can go in and you can find them so we're connected we're going to throw some beats on check them and I'll see how good they sound [Music] cool sound quality on here is probably exactly what you expect for 15 bucks it's not loud enough for me I wish it was maybe 25 percent louder maybe even more it's clear enough there's some bass you can hear it a little bit especially if you get that good seal but overall its it's not the best right it's 15 bucks you're getting what you pay for it when it comes to the sound on here let's keep going I did tracking near detection I turned off the yellow buds put the green ones in and they did sound exactly the same and I did turn off in your detection to see if that would make a difference and it doesn't in your detection does not work on here let's keep going we're gonna check out YouTube see how the delay is there's any latency let's check out if there is a slight delay it's not terrible I actually thought it would be worse so I'm a little impressed by that but there is some delay it's off a little bit let me see if I can forward and fix it now I still slightly there it is slights not that bad I wouldn't have a problem watching it on here but just know there is some delay on YouTube on iOS you weren't you're not gonna get that on Android devices and you're not gonna get it if you're watching Netflix or something like that let's keep going we're doing my test what up guys mic test pastel-colored air freeze another super close super copy well I might even call it that just another copy of the airport throat closed let me know what the mic is any good let's talk touch controls the way these work right there's a little different controls for each one and you can use one of the time it's playing music right now in my ear but if we just tap on here once it's going to pause if we tap on here again it's going to play and if we double tap it's going to go back it goes back and it one more time and if we triple tap it's going to lower the volume you can see the volume slider come up with triplet app it again and I will put this back in the ear and now the Left buds going to do the exact opposite the one tap should play and pause it does pause it or play it and - we'll go to the next track and three will bring the volume up and let's see if we touch and hold if it brings up Syria so that doesn't do anything it does beep when you touch and hold it I'll see if four taps does anything so now no way to bring up your voice assistance so look the air threes there's another air pop Pro copy in pastel colors nonetheless a fifteen dollar pair so really cheap but I know allowing us to you're getting what you pay for here right these things there's a lot of cons when it comes to these things you're not getting the real silicon tip you are getting in unique color no text on the back you're not getting that reverse magnetic hinge that lid that we like the vents on here they're not stickers but they're not real either they're kind of part of the paint which is a little weird sound quality on here is just adds $15 and that's what you're getting you're getting a $15 pair of sound on here the volume I wish it was louder it's clear enough I wouldn't have a problem with the clarity of the sound but it's just not allowed enough for me there is some latency when watching content on here so keep that in mind let me know how the mic sounds touch controls on here they're a little different than any other air pop pro clone I've tested you get the touch controls like the air pot one and two but you're getting volume control on here too and any other cone that we saw that we've seen and tested that has volume you can kind of touch and slide it this is a triple tap and it controls the volume so a little different you're weird pear right I don't even know what to make of these are they're worth 15 bucks probably but probably not anything more than that so the air 3ds and pastel check them out I'll drop the link more videos to come and this is just I just wanted to try this out I've seen these around for a long time now I know but I'll be back soon with more videos guys stay safe out there peace [Music]", "IxzhEs9iV8A": "[Music] peace what's going on guys I got going and welcome back to the channel today we have a special unboxing so we're gonna go ahead and see what the differences are but these should definitely be improved I'm going to go to the Hat where I purchased them so you can actually see how much they are and everything like that we'll check it out together right now so you don't have to like wonder what kind of features they have to offer so this is where I ordered them right here so as you can see they have almost 5 stars and 500 people already ordered these things it says they have pressure sensor force touch just like the original playing applause music volume up and down Siri and next song as well and then you can change the Bluetooth to you do get real capacity charging LED you do get GPS position for Bluetooth and you do get super bass quality as well and I'm gonna go ahead open up the package right here and let's just take a look at the difference between the 2 box and new one on the left and this is the older one on the right the older one is bigger a lot bigger oh wait it's just not inside there we never mind but it's a little bit taller a little bit but this one is no workers they've actually updated and put here pressure sensor volume change GPS name change and pop-up is real and then it says with wireless charging case and then here on these ones looks almost exactly the same as far as like the boxes there's no improvements with the boxes or anything like that this one's just a little bit bigger which is the older one so to see if these actually charge and these are the older ones right here and when you put them directly on this sensor right here they will charge yeah they'll just saw it but you have to put it like dead center this sort of a light but anyway it's not been open yet this is a brand-new package and it does say that the volume change pressure sensor GS P no GPS positioning and name change are real so let's go ahead cut this side and let's just check out to see if there's any apparent differences wait so they put some extra earbuds and on the top of there which is weird I've never seen that before okay so let's get this off all the way okay so that's all the way off and yeah there's no mistake this is the old one right here on my right and the new one and the kick the metal cage on the back seems to be a little bit wider and a little bit taller but they're identical in size this this charging LED on the new one is actually smaller as compared to this one which is bigger and I could visibly see that let's open these up and okay damn when I opened up these the older air pop Rose it turned on the Bluetooth on my camera right here which actually made it turn off so I have to start it all over let me just see we'll turn on the wireless charger right here and put the new ones right here and test out the wireless charging you can see that light is on right now it's orange and these are definitely charging you can see that light right there which shows that it's actually charging up on these flip these off to the side open this up and then they just threw in another random pair of earbuds these are even bigger wait it looks like so those those are like medium small and then you've got the lightning cable right here is the you know real cable it has the pervert the perforated paper right there which never works for me like I never do that okay let's just get that off of there show this one the full tab okay let's see we got some quick instructions right here this is the instructions and then it shows you to lift hold the case near unlock the machine and then basically it has to be five centimeters away so it says play pause double tap double back triple back you can remove eartips then press and hold for active noise cancellation and transparency modes so you have to touch the side piece right here to activate those transparency modes and open these and long hold that button on the back for like five seconds one two three four and I can already see them right here so let's hit that button and now it says that they're actually on pairing so let's just wait and see I'm gonna hold that button down wallet while it's connecting okay there we go let me see if I could show you that hold on put that in my ear and then open this one but this is the old one in my right hand and the new one in my left hand and yeah there's a this is a real sensor on the new one so this is completely fake right here but on this one there's actually like something there's like a microphone there and you can kind of make it out right here that one's real right here on my left hand and this is completely fake on the older one and then you can see the ear tips are different too it's like a completely different here too then when you turn it on the other side you can see right here they're the same shape and everything but this one's just like much more real and more more quality quality even though paid more for these ones so that was actually kind of weird but let me put the real one in my ear and put the fake one the old dude the older one back in here they don't see it does this have right on it yeah it's not the words right on here but it doesn't have like the serial numbers so let's just take that out you guys don't know this is my album see burner seat space burner right there but I just when I want to throw something on that I haven't listened to in a minute I got to throw on that nipsey I'm sorry that is I mean I should have lit I'm somebody we're gonna fly so let's get all get right cuz that's my song right now okay that sounds really good okay the bass is drop it right now okay hey let me turn this down a little bit I'm controlling the volume with the stems so you just tap twice you see this the song will change if you do it on three seconds on this one the song changes too but these have the removable tip let me just show you right here and these also have active and on the feature where you can actively noise right here it says right here just hold for two seconds and you can activate the active noise cancellation transparency mode alright these are really intuitive I'm like controlling the music volume and stuff with these just show you the stems too so this is the older one and this is the newer one and this one is black in the middle right here and then this one is actually like like the silver color so that's the main difference is you're gonna see that this one's actually black and then this one's like silver on the bottom so that's the only difference I just show you that right here this is the new one and this is the older model and the sound is definitely more improved and a lot louder and a lot more bassy on these new ones so when it comes to the touch controls I noticed tap once and you can play let me try that what's on tap wants to play or just squeeze once to play okay so that worked then you squeeze twice to increase the volume that worked one two and that works perfectly squeeze twice on this one to decrease the volume so sometimes I pause it and I just do it once so one and then you can play it again so one two now that decreases it and if I hold this for three seconds the song will change to three I've got a video real quick and just see if there's any playback when it comes to the lips matching the words or anything like that so let's just skip right here oh yeah so the lips do match the words perfectly fine I like how you can control the volume on here so you can press play and then one two increases the volume right down there it's definitely an improved version of them I got to give them credit I'm not sure how they did it but they definitely achieved some bad Colonna the ones I had already had you could put one in the case while you're listening and it's still please and continue listening by tapping if you want to pause it or play it but you know the sound quality is definitely really good but I definitely think you guys should check these out if you're looking for the newer and improve earbud with active noise cancellation wireless charging and volume controls whereas my older one didn't have those features but anyways your boy serrano I appreciate every last money make sure you hit the like button and the Bell if you found it helpful and in the meantime of a great morning afternoon or evening depending where you are peace later crew have a good night [Music]", "hkoWCX8sQf4": "(sips) - Mm, this tea is really good. I hope that I won't be spilling any today. Same Brain Mugs, link in the description. Do you guys know what's\nin front of me right now? Of course you do. AirPods Max. They are here, and I can't believe it. These have been rumored for quite awhile, but of course they were\nrumored under the name of AirPods Studio, and when\nthis name was finally announced, not only did people have a\nlot to say about the name, but they had even more\nto say about the price. At $549, they're a pretty\nexpensive pair of headphones, but are they worth it? Should we get this unboxing under way? Thought we would maybe go for something a little tiny today, just kidding. I don't even need a knife, do I? I'm so excited about this! These come in five different colors, this is the space gray,\nthere's also a silver, a pink, a sky blue, and a green, basically the same exact colors as the new iPad Air. Here we go, here we go, here we go! Oh, wow, ooh! Wow, okay, okay! Who says that, who says, \"Okay?\" - [Tyler] Lil Jon. - Yes. Oh, oh, oh this is paper, I thought this was the color of them. Oh, this is nice. I'm looking off camera\nat Tyler, he's like. Pretty. Look at, here they are. I'm gonna set them right there and let's just see what's in here. I was hoping that they would have a matching lightning cable\nfor each of the headphones, but they don't, it's just\nthe basic Lightning 2USB-C. I do wish that they\nwould've made these USB-C, but it kind of makes sense because all of the other\nAirPods in the AirPods family are all lightning, and the\nphone is lightning, makes sense. (gasps) It's magnetic. It's kind of like the Smart\nFolio case on the iPad. This soft mesh, this kind of feels like the Home Pod covering, super soft. This is the first taking\nout of the case moment. There will never be\nanother one after this. Oh, they're light. - [Tyler] Maybe do it from the top down. (beeps) - Go, there will never be another one. This is take two. Wow. (upbeat music) Ear cups off. Speechless. Okay, let's get these connected. You basically are just able to bring it next to each other and they\nshould automatically connect, here we go! \"Press the noise control button \"to switch between noise\ncancellation and transparency. \"The media control, press\nthe digital crown once to play, pause, twice,\" oh my goodness. I'm so ready. They're connected, they're\nconnected, here we go, here we go, here we go, are you ready? Holy crap, I'm excited! (gasps) Oh. It's such a nice fit, like\nyou don't even feel this sitting on your head. This is why they call it AirPods, because it feels like I'm floating on a freaking cloud. I need to listen to something right now. Transparency mode is on,\nTyler, say something. - [Tyler] Hi! - Hey, I can hear you! - [Tyler] Hello, hello. - I wish they, and it's\nlike so super clear, it's almost like I'm\nnot even wearing these. I don't even feel this\ntouching the top of my head. It's so wild. Okay, noise cancellation is now on. - [Tyler] Hey, Justine. - I heard you say something,\nI don't know what you said. Play Noah Cyrus, \"July.\" So if you press the digital crown button, that activates Siri. I'm gonna turn up with the digital crown. Oh, it even has the little click sound that the Apple Watch makes. (calm music) I have it so loud, like I think it's all the way up. I can't even, I actually can't\nhear my own voice right now. You gotta put these on. Get over here, get over here. So you're probably gonna have\nto adjust this a little bit. I actually never even adjusted it yet. I was even listening to\nthat over top of my hair. - Whoa, whoa!\n- Whoa. - Whoa. - I'm waiting, what?\n- Whoa. - What do you think? - I can't hear myself.\n- Right? - I can't hear myself. - I know! - Am I still talking?\n- Yeah. - I'll just keep saying whoa.\n- I know. - Play \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" by Drake. - Hmm, the tears of\nTwitter taste delicious. - I have them turned up all the way and I'm yelling, and\nI can't hear my voice, and it is perfectly, it's perfectly clear with no distortion at all. - This is the loudest that I've ever heard Tyler raise his voice, I've never-- - I literally have no idea\nwhat you're doing or saying. - I have never heard him\ntalk louder, this is it. - Okay, okay. Wait, aren't they comfy?\n- Oh my god. - I'm so in shock right now because I knew they were gonna be good, and\nI know everyone's expecting me to be like, \"Apple fangirl\nJustine, you got an I \"in front of your name,\nlike you're gonna like them \"no matter what,\" no. I am honestly, genuinely surprised. Oh my gosh, I can't believe\nthat I can't hear myself. This is so weird. You know, hold on. You know what this fine\ngentleman Drake once said? - [Tyler] What? - \"We started from the\nbottom, now we here.\" (laughs) I mean I don't know what else\nto say, like I'm honestly, like I am not being a fangirl right now because I really wanted to be critical, I wanted to have something to say. They're incredibly comfortable, like I don't feel this\non the top of my head. A lot of headphones,\nyou'll be able to feel this pressure on the top of your head. Where I do feel most of the pressure, it's kind of interesting because it is sort of like right around here, but it's giving you that\nseal around your ear. I still have transparency mode on and it sounds like I'm\ntalking perfectly clear, but, there's nine microphones\non here, did you know that? We're gonna get into the tech details. I wanted to do that before I do the test. But now, I'm so shook, I\ncan't even think straight. When they first announced this, obviously the AirPods\nare meant to be wireless but for me as an editor and\nfor a lot of other people who do a lot of stuff\nwhere you need to have no latency in editing or in\nsome type of music production, I need to be able to plug these in. So this is their lightning\nto 3.5 millimeter audio jack. This is crazy because I still\nhave the transparency mode on so I can kind of hear my hair\nrubbing on the microphone, but it sounds so perfectly clear that it's like I'm\ntalking without these on. And then when I lift this up, it automatically\ndisconnects from my phone, and then as soon as I put it back on, I hear it again connecting to my phone. I got distracted, so this is the lightning to 3.5 millimeter, and I'm\nlooking for something similar to this style for our podcasts that my sister and I do,\nyou guys may have seen that we have mugs now. Tea has never tasted better. I wanted to use these for podcasting that you have to plug them in, so that's where this comes into play. So this is a lightning to 3.5\nmillimeter headphone jack, so I'll be able to use this and plug this into our roadcaster so we can use these as we normally would use other headphones for our podcasting, and\nI am gonna try this out because we're actually\nshooting our podcast tomorrow, so this Saturday, if you guys\nwanna check out our podcast where I'm going to be using these, check out YouTube.com/samebrain, or you can find us on Apple\nPodcasts as Same Brain, or you can go to Anchor.fm/samebrain. All of the places, wherever\nyou listen to a podcast, it's probably there. That's gonna be a real test\nbecause we'll be wearing these for like over an hour and a half. The comfort level, anyway,\nthere's so much more that I need to tell you about these. (electronic music) So the new AirPods Max\nhave high fidelity audio with an Apple-designed\n40-millimeter dynamic driver that will produce well-balanced sound across the entire audible range. These also have a pair of Apple H1 chips for computational audio that is capable of executing over nine\nbillion operations per second to adapt the audio to the\nfit and seal of your ear. This is called Adaptive EQ. This actually measures the sound signal being delivered to your ears\nand will be able to adjust the low and mid frequencies in real time based on the fit and the\nseal around your ear, also taking into account\nglasses, hair, or even piercings. So for the noise cancellation,\nthey have eight microphones that are able to capture and cancel all of the unwanted noise. There's three outward-facing microphones on each ear cup and\nthere's one on the inside that's able to listen to the sound of what your ears are hearing. So using that H1 chip, it's\nable to analyze the data and is able to create an\nequal and opposite sound that will then reduce the unwanted sound. Transparency mode is something that is on almost all high-brand\nheadphones at this point so this will allow you to turn\noff the noise cancellation so you'll be able to hear\nthe world around you. You're able to turn this on or off on your iPhone, your Apple Watch, or even on the headphones directly with this button right here. Spatial audio is also something that is very interesting, and\nthey did announce this before and it is in the latest AirPods Pro with the latest iOS update, but I actually have not tried this yet, so this is gonna be so exciting, that I'm gonna be able to\ntest out the spatial audio for the first time on the AirPods Pro Max. So what this spatial audio\nis is it basically gives you a theater-like experience\nwith dynamic head tracking, so the sound is always mapped\ndirectly to your content, so as you move your\nhead, the accelerometer and the gyroscopes both in your AirPods, your iPhone, or your iPad will constantly be tracking and comparing\nthe motion of your head to your device. So Apple's obviously known\nfor their attention to detail in design and I really\nlove the look of these. So this is a stainless steel headband, and it has a mesh headrest and these memory foam ear cushions which magnetically attach to your AirPods and you can also mix and\nmatch these if you want to get an extra pair, so they're $65 a piece, so you can get them as a replacement or if you just want a different color. The digital crown is a really nice feature which is pulled from the Apple Watch, and this lets you adjust the\nvolume by turning the dial or push once to play,\npause, or answer a call, twice to skip forward,\nthree times to skip back, and then press hold for Siri. There's an optical sensor in each cup that will detect when\nit's placed on your head and positional sensors where the headband meets each ear cup that\nwill be able to detect the movement and rotation. There's also an additional\nninth microphone that is used to enhance your\nvoice during phone calls. So these have a 20-hour battery life and this smart case for storage. There's a built-in magnet\nthat activates the case detect and the sensor in each ear cup so that it'll be able\nto place the AirPods Max into an ultra low-power state\nto preserve the battery. So we're now gonna do\na spatial audio test. I've never tried this before, I know it is in the AirPods\npro, but for whatever reason, I haven't tried it yet. So today is the day, we've\ngot \"The Mandalorian\" all loaded up here. So in the control center, when you long press into the volume, this gives you your noise\ntransparency control and then you can also turn\nspatial audio off or on. Let me turn it off and see\nwhat that sounds like first. Spatial audio is off, turning my head, nothing is happening. Now let's turn it on, okay, now it's on. (gasps) Oh my gosh! It's like I'm in \"The\nMandalorian\" right now. Hold that thought. Hold that thought! (light saber sounds) Try spatial audio once. (beep) (laughs) Becomes a Jedi very quickly! (beep) The look on Tyler's face is very scared. (beep) Let's see here. Will I hurt myself or somebody? (triumphant music) Yeah! Where does that leave us\nin terms of this review? (beep) Spatial audio's cool, dude. (beep) Ooh, another test. Podcast test. There it is, ready for podcasting. Look at that, it's so small. Hello, hello. Turn this up, oh my gosh,\nit's freaking perfect. It sounds like I have transparency mode on but I don't because I'm\ntalking through the microphone and it's coming through my head. - [Tyler] What if you\nput Transparency Mode on? - Then it's just gonna\nreally mess with me. Hello, oh this is just weird. I'm talking to myself through myself. (laughs) Oh my goodness, Jenna\nis gonna lose her mind. Tomorrow we're gonna get Jenna's reaction and she's incredibly cynical. It's hard to impress her, I\nthink she's gonna be impressed. Try with glasses, with glasses. Oh, I've gotta try it with glasses. You have glasses on. - Yeah, it feels good. - Podcast game has just been elevated. Oh man, my head is small.\n- Yeah. - This is perfect, I don't even know, it's been really difficult,\nI'm sure many people who wear glasses have had the struggle of wearing glasses with headphones, Tyler's like yep, me. I mean I also wear glasses\nbut most of the time I do wear contacts, but this is nice. This is nice. Well thank you guys so much for watching, this was kind of just a first look and a first impression\nof the AirPods Pro Max. I keep calling it the Pro Max, but it's just the Max. I am honestly way more impressed than I thought I was gonna\nbe because obviously, like I knew they were gonna be cool because they are incredibly\nexpensive, but here's the thing, you're paying for what you're getting. - [Tyler] It's crazy. - I know, I know, I know. - Like--\n- I know. - [Tyler] It's totally\nbeyond anything I expected. - Same. - [Tyler] I thought they'd be nice, but. (electronic music)", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "zUO9k6MvoA0": "what's happened to be animation Peter bump the end I hear the new iPhones get really good battery life but what happens when it's not good enough well what I didn't realize until recently is that uh Apple released an iPhone excess max smart battery case now if you are familiar with the other older iPhones I know that they had these types of cases before they're kind of like a humpback case or not maybe the the slicky slickest or sleekest thing I've ever seen in my life but you know they are manufactured and designed by Apple so I kind of like the fact that they were obviously integrated and probably well tested in pretty high quality but I never tried one on my own and when I upgraded to the new iPhone I thought the battery life was really really good in fact even though full day's worth of use out of it is not uncommon that being said I'm really treed by this extra battery because there are some days where I could feel like I could really hunt you know tax it quite a bit now the first thing I will tell you is I pulled out the case you can see there's like foam and glue down here this is not a separate part but that's how it stays in there so really nice kind of overall engineer packaging in some ways and then here's the battery case it has a little bit of weight to it you can see here we've got all the the paper goodies inside looks like you kind of fold the top down slide your phone in and then flip it back over I'm assuming and I'm hoping that it's just as that simple and you can see I got it white they also have in a black but since I have a white iPhone I kind of wanted to match that and this one I'm talking about this little humpback it's almost like a three box car design here this looks very much like any kind of furnish silicone case we have really nice molded and buttons here and in gray and then cut out for the volume rocker cut out here with a large beveled edge for the camera again I molded in button Oh looks like it's gray there and then cutouts here for the speakers and then another Lightning port here because not only will I be able to put this on and I'm just going to kind of Bend this back and do it as they suggest because you kind of want to slide it right into this lightning connector there I'm gonna straight away so I'm going to slide that in okay got it just flip the top down and now you can see here we do get a little screen protection because this is where this edge is raised above the glass just a little bit it's by a millimeter raised which is nice that's actually pretty decent screen protection feels nice this is kind of our soft matte rubberized finish here so it's really smooth in the hand I kind of worry a little bit about this showing dirt and grime over time especially in the white but the black might do that too I do like that the Apple logo is right there you can see how tight of a fit it is around the camera housing I mean it just really hugs that housing and then as you might we'll see there even that's about a millimeter thicker than the housing so you'll get some protection there no problem getting to the switches here volume buttons everything works yep then you can see here speaker and microphone holes are all lined up but the battery because it's piggybacked here the Lightning connectors here where it's here on the phone now this is really kind of interesting here because this also will allow you in apparently it's integrated pretty nicely I'm gonna just hit the phone here and it's not charging so I kind of don't think that there's any charge on this bad boy yet but what we have is the capability to really charge us in any way you like so I've got a lightning cable here I'm just gonna plug it in okay so I saw the phone just power on you know cuz I've got two plugged in here and so you can see there it is actually charging so the case must have been discharged now I don't see any lights on the case to indicate the battery status to me so it's kind of just like regular charging of the iPhone you're charging the battery that's kind of passing through to the iPhone itself and obviously I think it'll work kind of in tandem not necessarily in parallel because I don't think this battery will charge up until this battery starts stops drawing on it it's really just kind of passing it through I'm only I don't see that I can't figure that the current here is enough to kind of charge them both in parallel so now the issue here is that because the iPhone access in the iPhone 10 and the XS max all had wireless charging they already thought of that and they put wireless charging receiver in the back of here so let's go and check that out and I also want to bring up the fact that what happens when your wireless charging and charging on a cable so I'll show you that too so I have a wireless charger set up here I've got the phone here I'm just gonna connect center with the hump centered no not getting anything there so if I actually Center it even though the hump starts here in the center of it's right here you actually do want to Center the phone for the most part you can see it's charging there now I'm gonna pull it off here because it's only shows up for a second but if I put it down here you can see I actually get two notifications about how charged the batteries on the phone and on the case right there and if I take it off so when you put it down or pick it up that's how it works now I'm gonna just go into my today view here too because this is where you can find the status as well so you can see my phone is pretty much Church but the smart battery case is not charged basically at all now the other thing I want to tell you here is I've got the phone down you know my room here is really well lit I should probably go low like but kind of in the instructions on the case it says that when it's charging there's an amber light that glows and I don't see that anywhere and it may just be too bright in here but even as I kind of looked in lower light levels I don't see it I might be hidden behind the case or kind of really subtle somewhere but I don't see that anywhere so just gonna keep better mind but I certainly think plugging it in is gonna be the fastest way to charge this up but it is kind of nice to have you know basically you almost double the battery capacity you know especially if you're gonna be on the road for extend period of time start early in the morning not be done till late at night can I having that peace of mind especially if you're gonna be taking a lot of calls or watch a video or play music those types of things so pretty cool I dig it you can pick this up you got to pick it up from Apple itself but I really liked the fact that it's well integrated obviously into the OS as well so I will put a link to the description peter brown panda out", "8C9I8MsRoic": "hi guys and welcome to today's video I think this is going to be quite an interesting product and quite a fun product as well what I have in front of me is what's called tws me Pro 4 and it's not any product by Apple but at the same time you think to yourself is it so I'm not quite sure but we're gonna unpack it we're going to see what came inside and we're going to compare it to the previous two models which is airports second generation and airports problems so first impression of the box looks quite good the only downside is the print quality you can actually see individual pixels obviously Apple would never allow such thing so let's unbox it and let's see what's inside so first of all you will be presented with these rectangular shape manual which is completely in English there is no Chinese language whatsoever so that's quite unusual and it's quite cool also makes you think whether that's going to be a real Apple product in the future or not obviously you've got your little airports there as well and a Lightning charging cable which is quite disappointing really because you can see it's not the best quality I probable never never allow packaging like that and you can see there is some dirt on the side as well so that's rather disappointing as well but hey ho so first of all straight out of the box let's compare the sizes so this is what's called tws mini pro 4 this is airports of the second generation and this is a case of airport pro so you can see what difference there is so before before I'll open this box let me talk to you through some figures so first of all the price if you'll find this little babies on Aliexpress which is quite hard to do the minute you probably looking to spend around twelve to sixteen US dollars inside of the case you'll find a battery which is 200 milli amp battery which will fully charge between one to one and a half hours which is quite good the seller or producer with a earbuds says that the EBUS will last three to four hours of listening time however in real life you should expect between one and a half to two and a half hours of Max at 78 percent volume whilst listening to the music it all Bluetooth 5.0 and the radius of connection that you should expect is about 12 meters which is usual for these earbuds and the other thing to mention is the earbuds themselves got 13 milli amp batteries inside of them we'll talk about the earbuds in the minute that let me talk about the case first of all so the case is made out of exactly the same material as the real airports would have been made and all the clones were made before that's how it looks it's got a little LED the biggest plus of that is that the only this little cut out that lights up and in darkness it's not the whole case that leads up as well right at the bottom you've got a lightning connection just then at the back you've got this little power button which is also quite clickable just to make sure that everyone knows you've got a clone not a real airport so it's people aware of that you've got a lead with a spring mechanism which is quite impressing for that price and that's a quite good spring mechanism much better than the previous copies that ever before there is not too much movement in the lid itself and the case as we seen before the case looks really really tiny that's one of the striking things obviously when I saw it on Aliexpress and said what on earth is that really is that like a future product of Apple or is that just just you know just imagination of Chinese guys oh I don't know just it looked really cool so I had to order one of it so let's take a look at the earbuds themselves that's what they look and this is the key point I think when you when you read reviews from people who use on airport quite a few people mentioned that they liked the second-generation airports because of their design their simplicity these like it's not like an ear canal these are the ear busters just sit in your ear they don't they don't protrude the dangle in and lots of people being really happy with this design because we had this design for you know four years these are the first earbuds ever to come out when even even when they were wired that's that's the way they looked and people really appreciated this but when the airforce poll came out quite a few people actually complain about this design and they said that they didn't like and what the chamber thought the guys from China did I think is they they've taken the top portion of Airport Airport of the second generation and the bottom portion of airports prod so now with tws mini prong when it's in your air on the outside it looks like you're wearing airport pro but you get this comfort of airports of the second generation which is quite incredible and in my opinion I've never actually been a huge fan of airport pro design it just looks to me it just looks a bit ugly it's really it's really weird-looking designer it's not to everyone's taste and I think what they've done with the TW has been improved for is is quite it's quite astonishing it's quite incredible it's a really pretty design in my opinion it looks really great it's tiny compared to the second generation because obviously this little leg here has been shortened but because they've added the squeeze sensor and they've also added this little mesh which is fake it's a sticker but it's a really robust stick at this time so you're not going to be peeling it off by yourself you'll probably damage the air but quicker than you'll peel the sticker off um it looks really pretty I think it looks really good and I really hope that what I have in front of me today is a future it's a future flagman of product from Apple perhaps maybe in the near future we'll see Apple actually making one of these so let's talk about the functionality of these earbuds what works what doesn't the transparency mode and noise cancellation mode they are there and you can actually switch between them but they don't work they just don't exist on this bus at all these squeeze sensors they do work but they don't operate on the squeezed pressure they actually work on just just your like a touch basically you just touch it from both sides and that's a great feature and it works on the city bus but at the same time it's quite annoying because you will encounter quite a few accidental touches so that could be done with your ear tip it can be done with your fingers it can be done with anything basically touching it so they can get quite annoying at times the way it works is if you squeeze if you squeeze the ear but once briefly that places your music on pause or carries on with playing it if you squeeze your ear but twice briefly that will skip the track forward or skip the track backwards depending on which year but you squeeze it on and also if you squeeze and hold for let's say just over a second maybe two seconds that will either activate your voice assistant or it will act will switch through the mode so like noise cancellation or transparency mode but as I said as I mentioned before they don't work so all you'll get is just a click and then obviously your music will just continue as normal nothing will change whatsoever thing is it's a good time for us to have a little pause and actually listen to a mic test so we'll listen how the mic works the mic is only placed in the left ear but and you can hear how it works in a quiet environment I don't think there's any need for us to go outside and trying to test this ear but because it's not of the greatest quality if it works which is great for that price is quite impressive so let's have a listen to the microphone right now here's a quick test for you guys I'm going to choir room I'm talking with my local boys and it's only to the left ear but it has a microphone and it takes a voice so you have a good chance to hear how the voice sounds and how the microphone picks up so there you go so now that you have a chance to listen to how the microphone sounds obviously you made your own decision whether it's good or not let's jump in and I'll show you how these connect to your iPhone and then we're going to come back and we're going to summarize today's video so let's take a look at the animation first it pops up in split second so that's quite cool like a real product and then if you scroll down to your quick access to your settings you can see you can switch between the different modes just like so but they don't work and then if you go to your main settings you'll find those sound modes as well and then if you go down this way you can choose settings for each of your earbuds so you can choose between Siri or your noise noise cancellation control when you're going to press your earbud more than two seconds there's also a faith test as well which you can you can perform and also this way you can turn on on all four your automatic automated in-ear detection sensor so now hopefully you've seen everything you need to see guys and I hope it's been helpful I hope it's been interesting because this is quite and quite a unique and quite an unusual product because I haven't heard a single thing about this on the internet I found it on Aliexpress by pure coincidence um so let me let me express my thoughts about this first of all I'm really impressed with the design I think it's so much better is it looks so much better than the airports of the second generation or airports draw because they are so that much that you know the case is that much smaller it's that much compact is so much easier to carry it around you and the other thing that impressed me as well is the overall design of the air but itself I think it's really really clean really sleek and really really futuristic design for the airports although it looks very similar to the previous models but to me it just ages when I when I pulled it out also to myself it looks really good I thought it looks really good for the price I think it's a cool product obviously I wouldn't bank on it to be your the best pair of earbuds because as I said as I mentioned the meets and highs are there but the lows are not so when you're going to listen to your music the bass is not going to be present as much so you're probably gonna like for those who like to listen to drum and bass of house music or hip hop and things like that you know obviously the bass needs to be there not the case with these earbuds but that's not to say that they sound terrible you know they sound good they they sound really clean and all you can hear the voice really clean and all the instruments and everything these actually compare a lot better than some of the earbuds that I had on reviews on this channel and yeah I think it's not so bad the downside of this it was is the sensors they can get really annoying at times because obviously you'll get you'll encounter those touches that you don't want to be there so like where you know you can with your ear and obviously the music will pause itself I think the product is cool I think for the price is good don't buy it if you want them to be your day-to-day earbuds I probably stick with something better than that but if you're curious if you believe that this could be a next future step from Apple and you wanna sort of have your hands on it by all means then all the way unfortunately I'm not going to be able to leave the link down below for they sell where I purchased this ear but simply because he liquidated himself so as soon as he sold few products he just deleted the page but what I'll do is I'll leave the little words that you need to type in in Aleks personal that you find this product with all the other sellers cool product looks cool I like it I'll be using it and we're gonna be selling I'm not going to throw it away I'm gonna be using some day-to-day basis as I've done with my eye and also my airport pro clones as well I've been using these for quite awhile now so yeah I hope this been helpful I hope this being a little bit fun for you as well if I've missed anything by all means many coming down below and I'll do my best to answer your questions and I'll see you guys in the next one", "9Z9xcrFGSLo": "hey there what's up everyone in this video I'm gonna show you how you can quickly reset your air pods hey there my name's Sergio with surge tech and in this channel I do tech reviews and tutorials so if you haven't subscribed already go ahead and do so now hit the bell to receive notifications on my future videos there's gonna be links to all the information that I talked about in this video down below in the description all right let's get right to the video now so you may need to reset it for multiple different reasons maybe because one of them is not working and one of them is or one of them is connecting and the other one isn't or maybe they're like freezing up and not working properly or many other reasons that you may want to reset your air pod pros so you can set them up with your iPhone so it's super simple let's go ahead and get right into it so all you're gonna have to do is once you open up your air pods they should pop up like this on your iPhone it's gonna read your air pods here that they are connected if it doesn't that's fine too this method should still work either way so as you can see right now they are connected when you open it up it changes here to connected as you can see so all we're gonna have to do to reset them is we're just gonna press and hold the connect button on the back of the air pod pros back here and we're gonna do it with the top open so you're gonna have to keep this open and with it open we're gonna go ahead and press and hold this button for a few seconds until this light turns red so it's going to turn white at first we're going to continue to hold it and then there you go once it turns red you can go ahead and let go and the air pots will be reset you'll notice now that when I close it and then I open it back up it will show the air pods as disconnected and it will now give me the option to connect obviously make sure your Bluetooth is on on your iPhone and then once you see this just go ahead and hit connect on your iPhone and wait a few seconds and your earbuds will be reset and reconnected so that they can start working normally again alright everyone so now let's just a quick video showing you how to reset also known as a hard reset your Apple earpods Pro so hope this video helped you out gotta give it a like it really helps me out and that's it for this video I will see you in the next one and as always peace", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "MeNmNPSKPmI": "noise cancelling so real me recently launched the real me buds air pro with 24 hours of playback and support for active noise cancellation up to 35 decibel obviously as an airpods pro user i was quite curious to find out how good are these butts pro and more importantly how good is the noise cancellation compared to the industry standards like airports pro well you know what this is mina from techwizer.com and here's my review of plm buds airpro also if you're planning to buy this i will be answering all your questions on instagram for next 24 hours just after publishing this video so head over to instagram.comtechvisor and ask your questions and while you are at it also check out our instagram giveaway we are giving out oneplus tv and oneplus birds and me band 5 to 3 lucky winners so yeah check it out [Music] let's start with the unboxing so in the box you get the real me what's pro with a cute little type c cable in yellow color seems quite small for daily use and then you also get two extra rubber tips one small and one large now when it comes to active noise cancellation it's important to pick up right ear tips because the rest of your experience depends on it if the ear tips are too big they will be painful and if they are too small they are likely to fall out taking a closer look at this earbuds its clearly inspired from the apple airpods pro but in a good way for instance here we have the premium airpods pro on one side and the bestseller realme birds air on the other and in the middle we have the real me buds air pro and as you can see the pro version feels more premium the led light is also crisp just like airpods pro while on the buds air and neo it's more diffused and look cheap similarly if you look at bag the buds pro has metallic hinge just like airpods pro while the air and new has plastic hinge and even with the in-ear design and rubber tips the pro feels much more premium now i know these are subtle differences but they do matter a lot with user experience in long term so first impression in terms of look and feel the real me buds a pro has significantly improved over the bird's ear and the bird's neo [Music] okay now let's pair this earbuds with the smartphone just like realme but's air the pro also supports google fast pair so ideally if i bring my tws near my phone it should automatically detect it using location and bluetooth permission and there you have a small pop-up tap on it and it's done pairing it's quite seamless no need to go to bluetooth settings and all that now this isn't real me words pro feature and more like google fast pair but i like it quite well as of now the real me link app doesn't work with the real me bud's a pro but in journal you can modify the button function and toggle noise cancellation on and off and just as you can find the lost airpods you can also ring the real me buds pro using these settings it's pretty cool [Music] another highlighted feature of this earbuds is the battery life it claims a battery playback of 20 to 24 hours for active noise cancellation to give you a perspective most of the tws at this price range or for 10 to 15 hours and airports pro of for 24 hours they also come with fast charging so if you have to go out for a run but your tws are drained out all you have to do is charge it for 10 minutes and then you will get a three hours of playback on a single charge the bud air pro are said to last five hours with active noise cancellation and up to 6 hours without active noise cancellation which translate roughly to 20 to 25 hours of total battery life speaking of which you can also easily check the battery level every time you open the case near the android device it will show you the battery level for left right and the case as well kind of like how you get in apple airpods comes in super handy there's no wireless charging though which i guess not many people use it in the first place okay so the buds looks premium and has bluetooth 5.0 fast pair that's all good but what i really wanted to check is the most highlighted feature of this tws yes the active noise cancellation the active noise cancellation in the bird's eye pro isn't something mind-blowing i mean the noise cancellation is turned on by default and you will certainly feel the difference when you put them in the air it will cut off steady noise from fan ac and other noises below 35 decibel however they aren't as good as the airpods pro or sony xm4 which is obviously understandable for the price overall don't buy them only for the noise cancellation or you will be disappointed but consider the noise cancellation as an added bonus nonetheless the noise cancellation does help to elevate the audio experience [Music] now because of the ear tips and active noise cancellation they obviously sound better than the previous version that is air and pro but just like most of the budget tws the vocals get unclear at loud voice so i only listen to it at 70 which is nice because listening to music at louder volumes all the time can also impact your hearing in long term however unlike many rumors on the internet these tws do not support ldac and then there are other small features just like airpods pro it is also ipx4 rated so it can easily block out sweat and you can read the rewards of working out with music and then there is also super low latency mode for only 94 milliseconds for your gaming session although do let me know what you guys are playing these days now that pubg is down [Music] now talking about the controls i personally prefer buttons for pause and play music or even the stem of airpods pro but in real me birds pro you get the sensitive button like double tap to pause the music and triple tap to skip to next song and if you long press on either of the earbuds for 3 second it will switch between normal transparent and noise cancelling mode now in normal mode the earbud works just like any regular tws the transparency mode allows you to pump in more surrounding sound so that you can listen to conversation near you without having to take out your earphones comes in handy if you are in a busy market or an airport there is also in-ear detection just like the air and the neo but this time i find it significantly laggy for instance the previous realme bird's air would instantly pause the music when i take out the earbuds from my ear but in the pro version i found a slight delay this could be a software issue since this is a pre-launch device but i will be keeping you guys updated in our upcoming comparison video and not just that sometimes the in-ear detection doesn't even resume the video automatically however i still need to test the battery life in depth and will be sharing it in the full review when we will compare all the other tws under 5k so finally who should buy it well you get pretty much all the features of real me butts air and if you pay a little bit extra you also get a better build quality a better audio a better battery life and kind of active noise cancellation it's quite an update for a marginal price difference so yeah i can easily recommend this to most people however i would like to point out that one of our real me birds air and bird's q stopped working recently and same is the case with oneplus butts and few other tws look the point is these tws offer great feature at great price but since many tech youtubers don't do long term review the longevity part is often left out so i hope there is better quality control on the steel me but air pro and i will be sharing my long term experience in the upcoming live sale so yeah keep an eye for that meanwhile this is a thumbs up from me and i will be answering all your questions live on instagram so catch you guys there", "TXIavxQayuY": "welcome to my video about the air pro diagnostic scan tool this video is going to be a basic introduction as to how to use the air pro scan tool as well as a little bit of a review of the tool itself i did previously make a video about the scan tool a few years ago when we first received it and so this is an updated video that i think will be a little bit more helpful than the previous one the tool comes in this protective case with these locking latches make sure to push that gray lever and then you can undo these latches to open the tool up and inside you will see this tool is actually a windows based tablet and you'll see these cords in here so this one cord is for the dlc that a link connector that goes to the car another one is attached to a stylus that you can use on the touch screen for the tool the on button you saw a few moments goes in the top right corner and this that i'm holding now is the charging cable goes in the front of the tool again depending on the tool it may be slightly different if the tablet has been updated but here we are turning the tool on and once we turn the tool on we come to this main screen and in the bottom left hand corner you can select shop and that will log the tool into the shop functions that we can perform and then you'll see on here the main screen for the windows software the only thing we really need in here is google chrome which you see in the top left make sure you're connected to wi-fi and the battery is charged on the device to get started with your scan make sure the device is in or near the vehicle so that you can plug in the data link connector once the data link connector is plugged in make sure that the ignition is turned on so this vehicle has a keyless ignition so the key is in reach and we push the button on the dashboard to make sure that the ignition is in the on position so that's called key on engine off now we're going to open google chrome and once google chrome loads then we can get into the software to start the scans always have a trickle charger attached to the vehicle when performing any type of scan the bottom right corner of the tool includes a voltmeter to ensure we're maintaining battery voltage at all times this is the home page that i'm logged into for air pro where we can see our current vehicles hit add repair in the top left to start this job we will manually input the vehicle's vin number some scan tools may automatically decode a vin number from the ecu however other scan tools such as this require us to input it manually to ensure that the vin number we see on the body matches that of the ecu's and other components within the vehicle so we will enter that and as we proceed afterwards the even number will be decoded and it will tell us the information on the vehicle and ensure that is correct uh also double check that you've typed the vin number correct as we know it's easy to mistype the vin numbers once it decodes we will look at the vehicle that's all correct there and then we'll select all the items beneath below starting with shop we only have one shop or one facility you can put in an ro or work order number and select insurance company if it's insurance work this is a customer pay vehicle so we'll go down to customer pay and this is an alphabetical order once we have customer pay in uh we'll skip the next box but you could put in a claim number and we are going to go and put in uh in here our vehicle mileage and so this one's a little over 41 000 kilometers and then we're going to take off some boxes if the airbags are deployed and if the vehicle is drivable they are not deployed but the vehicle is certainly drivable and then select the points of impact for damage and then we can go create and request in the bottom to proceed with the scan at the top of this page it will ask us what type of scan pre post or other this is a pre scan and then we can carry on down here and we're going to select any items if they're lit on the dash such as any cell check engine lights etc underneath here we can write other warning info and what i'm currently typing is damage description considering that the person who is going to scan this field vehicle cannot see the vehicle we want to provide an accurate description that will help them in their diagnostic process so put in as much information as you feel fit is it a hail damaged vehicle parking lot dent or has this thing been rolled several times any other notes that might be important for the person scanning such as if the vehicle is disassembled my contact info is in the bottom and then we've hit request and we're back on this main page we'll see the wrench outlined in white that means the request has been made but no one started it once someone has actually entered this then we'll see that wrench turn orange there we go that means someone's in there reviewing the information that i've submitted once they've reviewed that information and they're ready to scan we'll see the screen turn black and it will say scan in progress once it says scan in progress that person is actually performing the scan and as you're viewing this this is all in real time keep in mind as mentioned earlier that we need to keep the battery voltage up lights such as headlights and taillights will remain on while the ignition is on drain the battery which could cause faults while the scan is in progress you can do other tasks however do not do anything that will disturb the vehicle so keep weight off the passenger seat avoid pushing buttons things of that nature what we also have to make sure is that the ignition doesn't time out as we can see in the photo the lights on the dash are off meaning the ignition is timed out we'll have to push that button again otherwise we've lost contact with the electronic modules we also have to make sure that the scan tool itself keeps its own battery voltage up therefore keep checking the charge level on the device or plug it in and lastly make sure that the device itself keeps its internet connection if the wi-fi goes down then of course the scan will be stopped if the technician that is scanning the vehicles has any problems or concerns that technician may phone you and ask you to do certain things or check certain things on the vehicle additionally the technician will phone once the scan is complete to let you know not only that's complete but can also address any concerns with you if there are codes or other faults that have come up the technician can help you in the diagnostic process additionally you will receive that technician's contact information if you do want to discuss those items with the technician at a later point when the technician is complete the technician will log out and if you request shut the scan tool off at that point you can carry on with other tasks the technician will also send you an email with all of the documented information which we'll discuss in a few moments after the scan was completed i received an email including this position statement from the technician and so this is a position statement about pre and post gang from general motors and now what we're seeing is the actual certificate of scan showing the vehicle's information the information i inputted to as well as what was done by air pro and then their recommendations as to how we should proceed it will show every control module that was scanned in the vehicle this one has 21. it showed one module with codes and these are the codes that were present so in black we can see the code the name of the code and in red the technicians recommendations for what we should do so that certainly aids in the diagnostic process for us back on the home screen we can see this job up here and we can see these different colors if i hit the red button that'll bring the screen up to end it and i can give a review of how the scan went please review air pro let them know how they're doing if they're not doing well gives them an opportunity to improve in this box up here i can select jobs that we've worked on in the past so these ones that are pleated and paid for but i can go back and review the invoices review the previous scans or if it's a job we're going to work on again i can take that same information and re-upload it to start another scan on that vehicle perhaps you have a repeat customer so that's what we can do here and we can see that particular vehicle is now back at the beginning for us to continue work on it at a later date that concludes the basic operations of the air pro scan tool one of the things i really like about this tool is that it is a j2534 compliant pass-through device and with that it is a remote diagnostics tool which allows the technicians at air pro to aid in the diagnostic and scanning process which can be a huge aid or benefit to the body shop particularly as body shop technicians or whomever is performing the scan of the body shop may not be as well trained in these areas specifically more advanced diagnosis this really allows a huge advantage for the body shop as opposed to taking the vehicle to a dealer every time and allows air pro the opportunity to use oem software when performing and calibrating post scans so this tool has been working quite well for us in the time that we've had the last few years and while this video is not a promotional video for air pro i am very satisfied with the tool and the service that we have received as well as the ease of use i do highly recommend body shops consider this tool or something very similar to it for body shop operations as there are many inferior tools out there that may not perform all the operations that a body shop should be performing when repairing collision-damaged vehicles thank you", "s2lCkVHQYus": "- And here they are, the new AirPods Pro. (relaxed electronic music) (video tape whirring) Today we are checking\nout the new AirPods Pro. These were just announced by Apple and I'm so excited to check them out. These are the newest line of Pro products to join the Apple lineup. You may be wondering what's\nthe difference between these and the regular AirPods? Let's unbox and find out. (relaxed electronic music) And here they are. The first thing that you're gonna notice is the case is slightly larger. But it's weird because\nit's kind of just like squished the other way. New AirPods, old AirPods. At checkout you also have the option of engraving your AirPods, much like I did with previous gen, which I'm so happy I did\nbecause I get these confused with people's all the time. But guess what? Not anymore because my name is on it. So the case kind of just looks like it got squished a little bit because the size isn't\nreally that much different, it's just a little bit larger. All right, let's open them up. So the main highlight of\nthe brand new AirPods Pro is the fact that they\nhave noise cancellation. And it has active noise cancellation, but it also has a Transparency mode. And with this Transparency mode you're able to hear the outside world. So to make all of that\npossible they had to redesign what the actual AirPod looks like. These now have a little\nin-ear silicon tip on them. And also inside the box\nare two other size options, in case the one that\ncomes with it doesn't fit. There's a little microphone\nand each one of these, inside of your ear so. The AirPod is actually able\nto hear what you're hearing. And with that they're\nable to make adjustments to outside sound, to really make the active\nnoise cancellation work. This also comes with something\nelse that I'm excited about, which I feel like this is\nmoving us closer and closer to USB-C, this comes with a\nUSB-C to a Lightning cable. Let's get these paired\nto my phone, immediately. One of the things that's\nso great about AirPods is you basically just have\nto get it close to your phone and it will automatically start pairing. And they're connecting, connecting. \"Media Control,\" so this is\nshowing you how to use them. So what's different with these ones is they have this little\nbutton right here, so there's different\npresses that you can press to activate different things. Like changing tracks, switching\nfrom Transparency mode to noise canceling. Also pretty cool because you\ncan do all of these things inside of the Control Center. Before you you should\ndo their little fit test that they have. So you go into your Bluetooth settings, and this is one of the\nplaces that you control the Transparency or you can turn both off, just to have nothing, normal AirPods. And you can also activate\nthe noise cancellation. This can also be activated by swiping down and doing a long press on the volume. Noise cancellation, off, Transparency. This option is also\navailable on the Apple Watch. And, if that's not enough,\nif you do a long press that will also switch between\nthe different options as well. So right now I'm in\nTransparency, and it's so weird. I've used so many headsets\nthat have this kind of setting, that lets the outside noises in. What's so wild about this, I don't even know how to explain it, 'cause if you ever use these\ntypes of things before, it seems to make your\nvoice super, super loud. So you just sound extra\nloud inside of your head and then the whole world around\nyou also sounds really loud. But it's kind of like\nthis heightened sense and it's very strange. But with this, I honestly\nfeel like I forget that I even have them on. So before I get into testing these out I need to do my fit test. So I have to make sure that\nthese fit well in my ear. And I feel like this, I think it might be a little bit too big. So I'm going to switch\nthese to the smaller option, and these are really so easy\nto just take off of here. You just, and you do\nthe same thing on here. And it's weird because I\nfeel like I'm gonna break it, but it has a really snug little seal and you just pop it right off, and you pop the new one right on. And you can also keep this\nto house those previous ones. Okay, so now that these feel like they're fitting pretty snug. Let's go back into Justine's AirPods Pro. And this here is the Ear Tip Fit Test. So using those internal microphones, it's able to hear what you're hearing to make sure that there's\nactually a good seal between your ear and the\ninner ear silicon tip. So let's test the fit of your ear tips. Here we go. It's playing a little song for me. And here it is these are\nmy ear tip fit results. It says I have a pretty good seal, okay. So I feel like this is one of those things that you're just gonna have to test out and see what works best for you. So crazy, 'cause I'm using\nthe Transparency mode, so does even feel like I\nhave these in my ears at all. Now I wanna play some music, these also have Siri integration, so if I wanna to listen to\nsomething I just have to say, play the new Tool album. Okay, so I'm still using\nthe Transparency mode and if I wanna switch\nto noise cancellation, I'm just gonna hold this in. Okay, now it's. Oh gosh, this is so crazy. It's real, I just! You guys are sitting there just\nwatching me do weird things and make weird expressions, so without actually\nbeing able to try this. So what I'm doing is I'm pressing on here. One press to skip tracks,\nplay or answer a call. Two presses to skip tracks,\nthree presses to go back a track and the long press, that's which is between\nthe noise cancellation and the Transparency mode. So there's so many different options and ways for you to switch\ninto these different modes. So it's kind of crazy that\nthat's just another way to do it. You could also do this. You can even ask Siri to\nturn it on and off for you. Turn on noise cancellation. Turn off noise cancellation. And just like that, Siri turned it off. So far I'm really liking these a lot. When I first saw the rumors\nof these types of headphones from Apple I got a little bit nervous because a lot of times these\ndon't work with my ears. I have very sensitive ears. So I am beyond excited to\nreport that my sensitive ears are not bothered by these at all. And it's kind of crazy\nbecause a lot of times noise canceling headphones like this release some sort of weird pressure. But this also has a little thing, it's got like this little airflow vent that they've included. So that allows for air flow\nto kind of go in your ear, so it makes a much more natural feel. So let me give you a\nside-by-side comparison over the old and the new AirPods. Because it's crazy the size difference. I mean look at this. (relaxed music) New AirPod, old AirPod. Old AirPod, new AirPod. So even looking straight on, you can already instantly\ntell the difference. The little antenna is way\nshorter on the new ones. So I had to go somewhere\noutside of my office to really test these out. The sun is about to set so I thought I wanna to go to my favorite coffee shop, get myself a latte, so I can stay up all night\nediting this video for you guys. And, it's crazy, because right now I'm using the Transparency\non the new AirPods. And there's traffic, there's people, but I can hear all of it until I tell Siri to turn on noise cancellation. Turn on noise cancellation. I hear a slight rush of traffic. I don't wanna talk to loud, 'cause I'll sound like I'm yelling. Play the new Tool album. So let's go into the setting. You can see the like\nnoise cancellation is on, and then we're gonna turn the volume up. So that I have the volume\nturned up a little more, I actually can't hear anything else. Turn off the noise cancellation. The Transparency is on,\nI can hear the traffic, I can hear my music. And now I'm gonna turn the\nnoise cancellation back on. Oh man. This is so great, I'm\nso excited for you guys to actually experience\nthis, if you do get these. (gasps) I can still hear\na slight bit of traffic. With the mix of music and\nthe noise cancellation, this sounds amazing. I don't even really know how\nto do this demo for you guys because you can't\nexperience what I'm hearing, so I can only sort of explain it. Let's put a noise\ncancellation back on. (laughs) Surprise, I don't hear anything. We seem to be losing light now. So the sun is setting. So I'm gonna actually go back home and I'm gonna edit this entire\nvideo using the new AirPods. So back to my unboxing room. This case is also a\nwireless charging case, much like the new case that just came out in the last version of the AirPods. I did get a chance to\ntry these on a flight and I was really impressed. Mostly because you kind of just always consistently hear this,\njust, airplane sound. It's just like a shh. (airplane whirring) It's just in your head. So even when I wasn't\neven listening to music, just turning on the\nactive noise cancellation, just put me at peace. And then, while playing music, and with the active noise cancellation on, it really did drown out\npretty much everything. So with the AirPods Pro you'll get five hours of listening time, but if you have active noise cancellation or Transparency on, you'll get about 4.5. And about 3.5 hours of talk time, but with a five minute charge that will give you an extra\nhour of listening time. And this entire case will\nprovide you with about 24 hours of listening time. So if that's not enough time\nto get you through your day, I'm not sure what is. Something else that I'm excited to try out is the audio sharing. So if I'm listening to some\nmusic or watching a movie and my friend wants to also\nlisten or watch my movie, over my shoulder, on a flight,\nwe can do audio sharing. So all your friend has to do is bring their AirPods close to yours. I can temporarily share my audio. Since these are my AirPods, I guess I'm temporarily\nsharing them with myself. But that's pretty great. So when I clicked, it to connect, it's just giving me this\noption to temporarily connect. \"You can now listen to music, watch video \"or play games together.\" Holy moly, done! Okay, so I'm gonna act like these are in someone else's ear right now. Play a Macklemore & Ryan\nLewis, \"Thrift Shop\". Justine's AirPods #2 are connected. And here you'll see you\nhave the volume options for both AirPod sets. This is so great. And, obviously, since\nI have the Pro version, I can click in and I can\nchange my noise cancellation Text Jenna Ezarik and ask\nher if she likes candy. So I have this set up so that\nit'll read text messages, and then you couldn't\nautomatically respond from there, as well, using Hey Siri. So she just read the\nmessage to me that said, \"OMG, yeah, sad crying face.\" Me too, I'm making a video and thinking about Halloween candy. It has a little notification that it says that it was sent with Siri. I really like that because a lot of times, I mean, it's no secret that sometimes Siri thinks that you're saying something and you're not saying the correct thing. So this will at least give context. I know there's definitely some times that I have written some\nvery lengthy things to Jenna and it's very obvious that\nit is a voice to text. So this is really great because this will actually let them know that you're not typing\nit and you're hands-free. So if you do get the new AirPods make sure you're updated to\nthe latest iOS on your phone, so that you'll be able to\nuse all of the features. I really love the audio sharing. I think that's probably one\nof my favorite things so far. Especially for traveling\nand different flights and playing games together. My first impressions, I am\nactually way more impressed than I thought I was gonna be. I love the case, I love\nthe design, I love the fit. I am in love with the Transparency mode. I would love to know what\nyou guys think of these. What is your first impressions, having not even seen them yet? I'll be making it follow-up video, probably within a week or so after I've really got a\nchance to try these out, test them in the wild, edit\nwith them and listen to music and probably play a lot\nof \"Call of Duty: Mobile\". Has anybody else been playing\n\"Call of Duty: Mobile\"? Because it is so incredibly fun. I know that the new \"Call\nof Duty: Modern Warfare\" just came out, I've been playing\nthat a lot on Xbox as well. But the mobile version is so much better than I thought it was gonna\nbe and I'm really good at it. I don't know if I'm just good or if everybody else is terrible, maybe a combination of both? But that's a whole nother story. Anyway, AirPods. Don't forget to subscribe\nso you'll be able to see all of my future videos. And be sure to hit the bell, so you'll be notified\nwhen I do post new videos. I've got a bunch of great\ncontent coming up for you guys. We're just continuing this month\nof incredible tech gadgets. So I'll see you guys\nin my next video, bye. (upbeat music)", "RxJxRpaXdYY": "hello everyone this is charles bridge dick with another flashlight review this time on an air pro dc-7 now i will sent this by the seller and manufacturer of this light directly they do have an amazon store comes in this box alright so let's take a look here what it says here on the side uses for cree XP - el high LEDs takes 418 650 s so let's wait no further let's open this up see what's in come with the user manual now this does have some programming capabilities but their main goal was to make it simple because it is similar to the BLF q8 so they wanted to keep the UI as simple as possible as a tripod mount ring on there so you can put the landed on there this is a USB type-c charging cable so you'll be able to charge those batteries in there now mine did not come with batteries so this is not a complete kit there's the lanyard very nice quality by the way and it is a large style for larger hands so that's nice plus it is adjustable for smaller hands alright that's everything out of the box there so let's move this to the side let's take a look at the light now this is about the size of a soda can you can set that up right if you need to really like this pineapple knurling on this there's the charging port does have a cover on there to keep dust and water out feels really good and tight in here there's the tripod area we can put that on a tripod as well now the button is pretty much flush but it does stick out just a little bit does have some heat sinking on here it's a big plus there's the model steel bezel on here style and design on this is very nice so I'm gonna bring out the BLF that way you can see it here and you can see there's very similar in host as far as the head of the light is concerned a little bit different there but I really like that pineapple knurling on this really gives it a uniqueness identical on the heads now the BLF uses the HD version LEDs of the xbl so it's not as good a throw as this one is I've already tested this and this is really doing very well so this is really doing well because I'll show you this is running the smooth reflector very similar to the other one there but this is running the cree XP - el high LEDs so there's no domes on there so that allows this light to have better throw still a good combination beam of both so you've got both throw and combination of flood in there to help you see around the general area as well so again style and design on this is very nice not seeing any issues even in the quality control feels really good I've never heard of this brand before but I was very eager to get my hands on a sample now the machining and finish on this is excellent not seeing any issues there no sharp edges on this everything is very nice smooth finish on this so now let's go ahead and open this up and I'll show you the batteries that I'm going to be using in my test now the threads are well greased holding there as well there's the straight contact point on the head alright and I'll show you the batteries that I'm going to be using in this test here these are the ease fan or the gives fan these are the 3,500 milliamp these are an unprotected cell these are ten app cells that's some really good luck with these and I'll leave a link to these batteries in the description area they promoted some batteries for my reviews and we'll look down inside they're really nice heavy-duty Springs as well even the inside is very nice and detailed on that nice work okay so now let's get it back together and we'll go over the UI now the BLF uses a little bit more difficult now the BLF here uses a little bit more options in their UI this one here has been stripped down a little bit so it makes it a little bit easier to use so it's more user friendly is what they're trying to get up so we're going to go ahead and turn it on and as you can see the side light comes on there and it is on so we're going to go ahead and ramp it up this is going to wrap up and I really like the ramping features on these lights because they really do well that's on the highest output they're five thousand lumens really floody beam but this is going to be more of a combination but it's gonna have a little bit more throw you can see the concentrated hotspot there a little bit of bleeding before it gets to the spills really nice and wide and then of course you can just press and hold this button to lower back down and it goes down nice and slow until it gets to about halfway mark and then it'll drop off quickly and then you're right back to the lowest setting and that's really nice low output especially on this flashlight since it's about the size of a soda can so now we're going to go ahead and click this to turn it off and then we're going to click it three times one two three that clicked on there so now you can see you can click and hold to go through those light outputs now if you don't want that and you want to go back to the ramping you can 1 2 3 and they'll go back now you're back into the wrapping so if you want the stepping feature press and hold we'll go through those light outputs or the ramping which is what I like the most so I'm gonna keep it on there then from here you can hit it 4 times 1 2 3 4 and now it's locked out that locks out the light and this type of light that actually gets turned on if you had it on the highest output that's really going to start to melt whatever you have it in and that's not a good thing so you definitely want to lock this out you can also turn the body of the light maybe a half turn to one full turn and that'll break the connection there to manually do it but you can also digitally do it so we're now we're gonna put the light back on 1 2 3 4 and as you can see the light blink there so now we turned it back on and we're right back where we left off so that's all of the UI that I'm going to show on this light I've done quite a few reviews of lights that are like this in soda can size as well but this one here they're selling on their amazon store so I can't wait to take this outside see how it does in the wilderness Shh we are out here in the dock with the air pearl dc-7 so we're gonna do some night shots here I'm gonna wrap it up on low all the way to turbo here check it out believe it or not that is on you can easily see 510 feet easily there any further stretched feed off as you can see on the fence all right we're gonna wrap it up here we're gonna go up a little ways not too much 35 feet to that waterspout 65 feet to that tree from where I'm standing tree line fence line faintly making it across the park even at this little light output really nice 138 feet there to that tree of life starting to turn green tree there behind its is 238 feet all right we're gonna go to probably half way here let's see how it does and there's hopefully about halfway it's a lot of light usually seeing across the park there and there's another park there I've got the tennis courts they're treated quite a ways back there usually seeing that 230 feet to that tree there 138 feet to the Tree of Life from where I'm standing you can see a lot of spill area here still making the school even though it's lit up faintly making those palm trees before after now we're gonna go the highest output here on the Tree of Life I knew that would happen look at how wide that is 138 feet tree behind it's 230 feet easily lighting up across the park huge spill area you can see where you're walking until you reach your target point parks over there are long ways off tree here pressive tree line fence line we're going to do a beam profile here about why this is clearly out of range of the view of my camera now I'm feeling this is this getting warm not bad though before after excellent of course palm trees are lit up not bad at all clearly a combination beam which is nice very nice all right we're gonna fade out here hope you enjoyed those night shots okay welcome back hope you enjoyed those night shots now I went ahead and put on the adapter there to go in the tripod mount we could put that landed on there now this light from the BLF that was one of the complaints I had because after a while your hands of carrying this may slip and fall or whatever activity you're doing really like having a lanyard with that so you can know that if it does slip out of your hand it's not going to fall and hit that ground so especially if you're carrying it for a long period of time so them adding a USB charging port and a lanyard option is a huge plus over this model from air pro versus the BLF q8 now performance on this in my opinion as far as throw is much better so I would say it throws probably a couple maybe a couple more hundred yards than the BLF but as far as brightness there's not really too much of a difference now I want to thank air pro for sending me this to review this being their first flash light model it's pretty big step for them to enter the market with this I think it's going to be very successful and I hope I can get more of their lights in the future my hat's off to again to you guys you did a real good job with this now if you are interested in getting this I'll leave a link to their store in the description below and I'm working on a discount code to help you save some money on this should you be interested in getting it well that's it for me I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please share like and subscribe that way can bring more of these new lights from air pro to you in the future thanks for watching take care", "kBbqaEMgesc": "hello and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about a really really common problem and it is the center pin issue what is that you may ask the center pin issue is if this little plate inside here is too low and doesn't make any proper connection anymore with this little pin inside here with the atomizer positive pole or with sorry with the positive pole of your atomizer which is this bit in here most people think the battery is completely faulty and can't you can't go to work any more that's actually a little mistake because you can get it to work if you bet this Saturday the center pin actually can be too low after week of use after 2 weeks of use after 3 weeks of use or even after 6 month I don't know the reason for that is actually some atomizers have quite outstanding opinion here some batteries have a pin in here which is a bit lower or which is a bit more inside and therefore you can experience these these contact issues unfortunately and in this video I would like to show you how to fix it all you need to do is actually to take your battery and take your needle I take this needle from a multi meat for my multimeter now and you go inside see carefully and now you move this plate a bit into this direction and then you turn your battery around like so ah that is not easy doing it in front of a camera and you move it back into this direction and now try to get into the back into the middle again like so I really hope you can see that properly and then screw the atomizer back on it let's check it I hope you can hear that so this is working in again so all you need to do is actually just erase that center pin a tiny bit with the needle or something like that but do it careful and then you on the safe side and that's actually it so your battery's probably not faulty it's just a little reconnection problem and that's it thank you very much for watching and I speak to you soon gyah", "ok7Z_i_Kl8s": "good morning everyone welcome to another west coast weed tour video today i'm going to be doing the vessel unboxing so this is the vessel device which they've sponsored the west coast v tour so thank you to them this is uh just the vessel and the usb charger it's a really cool design that's performance air intake a smart battery led indicator four power settings and it has a long lasting battery as well as a magnetic charging port which is really cool so i have the charging base as well that i'm going to open up and it came with a really cool carrying case so i'm really excited about this i've never even heard of this brand so that's pretty cool wow very fancy welcome to vessels put a little insert start with the the lowest setting or your oil to find your optimal setting device turns off after 15 minutes we recommend you fully charge your device before the first use so i'm definitely going to do that remove the back cartridge black cartridge and replace with your choice of cartridge enjoy wow very cool all right so here's what it looks like on the inside i like the wood grain it's very earthy wow okay cool so how does this work it's like i'm gonna break it no okay oh there it goes okay so this guy goes around the cartridge it just looks like a standard screw-in and this is just the stock cartridge or the cartridge placeholder interesting yeah this isn't a cartridge this just holds it in place in the case i guess that's cool i'm gonna put that back in so we'll lose it all right let's open up the base oh the chargers in the bottom the charger is one of those screw-on ones which i don't know how i feel about those those always get gunked up you guys like that i brought my plant friend with me today oh [ __ ] pretty fancy it's a lot smaller than i thought wow so this is the whole charging base look at that that's cute and then you still obviously plug in the charging base so it's just a usb cord i'm gonna have to plug this in at some point but then oh yeah so your battery just goes right in there oh kind of clicks in that's nice very cool and then the carrying case organize and carry your vessel experience in this protective case pretty cute it matches my wood grain my mom says that i like mid-century modern earthy that's my vibe which i don't know that means but apparently that's a style wow awesome so you have room for two of them and then a couple extra cartridges and you can put some stuff in this side oh it's probably upside down i probably did that upside down yeah that fits a little bit nicer there you go so there it is my carrying case awesome looking forward to doing some really good cartridge reviews with this guy so stay tuned for those ah amazing have a great day guys", "jWd6gQerRrU": "what's up guys my name is Brandon and today I'm gonna be showing you the first 11 things you should do right after getting your brand-new ear pods Pro now whether you've had ear pods in the past or this is your very first set of ear pods these are going to be some very helpful tips and tricks that you need to know about to get the most out of your brand new set of ear pods so we're not gonna waste any time let's go ahead and get into the very first thing you should do and that is to make sure that your iPhone is updated to iOS thirteen point two or later and you can do this by going into settings go down to general go to software update and you should see iOS thirteen point two there if you are not on it already and if you're not on iOS thirteen point two you will see this little pop-up right here that says some features of this audio accessory require a newer version of iOS and it will prompt you to update right there now with that being said you can use the air pods Pro on versions prior to thirteen point two you're just gonna be missing out on some of the best features with the air pilots Pro so you can see right here this is actually the settings page for pre iOS thirteen point two devices and you can see there you can still toggle on and off noise cancellation but you can't customize any of the toggles you can't turn off or on transparency mode and you're just very limited with what you can do inside of the settings if you're not on iOS 13 point two so we definitely recommend you update your phone to iOS thirteen point two before using your air pots Pro and while we're on the subject of boring software updates and firmware updates let's talk about the firmware for the air pods because yes your air pods you also have a firmware version and they do also have firmware updates just like your iPhone and you can actually find this by making sure first of all that they are in the case and connected to your device you want to go to Settings General abouts and make sure the case is open and then you want to go down to below the Eid you will see the air pods right there might say Britain's air pod pros go ahead and tap on that and this is where you get the information about your air pod so you can see right there I am currently on the latest firmware version at the time of recording this and the air pod Pro is actually shipped with firmware version to be 576 and that had an issue with charging so some people report out some major charging issues with that so Apple did push out the fix and this is the current latest as of the recording but of course this won't be if you're watching this at a later date but if you're on to be five seven six if that's what your firmware version shows you definitely need to update the firmware on your air pods and air pots will actually update themselves all you have to do is have them in the case right here and then you just want to set them in a charger on a wireless charger or just plug them in and charge them and it will update automatically you want to force it to update just you know have your phone nearby have it unlocked and then they should update and you can go back into settings general belt to make sure that the firmware was updated on your air pod pros so now that we got the boring things out of the way let's get into some of the more interesting things that you need to do first with your air pod pro so the number one thing I would say after the firmware versions and things like that are to figure out what size eartips fit your ear the best so as you know the air pod pros did come with three different sizes for these silicone ear tips right here so we have small medium and large they ship with medium and then you get this in the package with small and large where you can change them out depending on the size of your ears so obviously you're going to put these in your ear first just to see which ones feel the best but Apple does also include something called the ear tip fit test which will actually tell you if that's the right fit so I'm gonna go ahead and put these in my ears and then I'm gonna tell you why you may not want to listen to that so let me put these in my ear real quick so now we're gonna go into our settings we're gonna go to bluetooth and we're gonna find the little eye next to our ear pods Pro right there go and tap on that and scroll down and you will see your tip fit test right here if you want to go and tap on that then we want to click on the play button and it's gonna play us a song so I played that real quick and you can read right there that it says I have a good seal on the medium but however you should try out the other ones just because it says you have a good fit you should try out the other one so I'm gonna try out the small ones because a lot of times the smaller the tip the better it will probably feel inside of your ear so it's pretty easy to take the tips off you just have to use a little bit of force just kind of pull it out just like this just like that and now if we want to put the small one on it's very easy to just attach it you will hear a little click just like so once you hear it click it is in there and then go ahead and put this in your ear and see if this feels better than the medium because just because it said it's a good fit doesn't mean it's going to be what feels best in your year so now that I have the small end we'll just do this real quick and you can see it says I have a good seal with the smalls as well so just kind of experiment around use all the different tips depending on your ear size and just see which one feels best in your ear don't just settle for the medium just because it says that has a good seal and it feels good in your ear you may find something that feels a little bit better the next thing you guys want to do is learn the new stim gesture so the air pods Pro have a brand new set of gestures and a new way to invoke the gesture so if you had the air pods one or the air pods two you're used to just tapping and double tapping to skip tracks or pause tracks or go back and things like that but it's different with the air pod pros because you actually use a little squeeze and hold gesture instead of tapping on the air pod itself because the air paws a little bit smaller and that would mess up the fitment in your ear if you were to just tap on them so if you look really closely at these air pods you will notice a little indention on the outward facing side of the air paws and that's gonna be where you invoke these gestures that's gonna be what you squeeze that's gonna be what you tap it's gonna be what you hold when you do all of these gestures that I'm going to be showing you about so keep that in mind it is going to be outward facing it's probably gonna be a little bit weird at first doing these gestures but you will get used to and you're probably gonna like it better than tapping so if we go into the menus right here we have the left and the right air pod and this is where you can select what you want each one to do with the tap and hold gesture on the stem of the air pod you have the options for noise cancellation transparency and off alright so I have the air pods in my ear right now and you can see right here this is set to noise cancellation and transparency on the left and then the right is the same thing so we have the same settings for both but they do different things so I'm gonna go ahead and invoke my left one right here and I'll pull this up right here so you can see what it does with noise cancellation and transparency down here at the bottom so I'm tapping and holding on the bottom left and it changes to noise cancellation so right now I can hardly hear myself talk about tap and hold on the right air pod it switches to transparency so it's very easy to switch back and forth when you have the gestures set the way that I have them set I believe that's the default way as well you can change it around if you want to invoke Siri and things like that so just mess around with those and find out what works best for you now you do also have the play/pause skip track previous track and things like that as well so I'm gonna go into my music just so you could see how this works I said for this I'm gonna make the iPhone think that my air pods are in by just squeezing it like this I'm gonna show you how these gestures work for music controls so I have to do is a single squeeze just squeeze on that and you will feel a little go out and turn that down you will hear a little noise you will hear a little click when you invoke that gesture again that's just a simple tap and hold just for a brief second and that will play and pause your music as you can see right there don't hold it otherwise it will do what we just talked about with the noise cancellation and the transparency mode but if you double squeeze that skips the track so boom boom just like that and it will go to the next song let's try it again right here again you will hear it you can see right there it's changing songs on my iPhone and then three taps if you just press and squeeze three times rapidly that will go to the previous track so again a single squeeze is pause a double squeeze is to go to the next track a triple squeeze as to go to the previous track so one last time I'm going to show you guys boom boom that goes to the next song one two three that goes to the previous song and then one tap starts to play the music one more tap and squeeze makes it pause so it's very easy and you will definitely get the hang of it it's a little bit weird at first especially if you've had old ear pods but I actually like this better I think there's a lot more versatility with this method of the gesture so I'm a big fan just get used to it and learn those because that will be very very handy when you're doing things and you don't have access to your phone like you're riding a bike or playing sports anything like that the next thing you guys need to do is set up the microphone side so again inside the settings right here go down to the very bottom and you will see microphone right there this should be set to automatically switch but you can also have this to always left or always the right air pod and basically it says right here it says the active air pod microphone can automatically change from left to right or be fixed to one side so obviously both of the air pods do have a microphone built-in but for whatever reason if you only wanted to have the microphone active on one side or another you can change that setting right here now the next thing you guys need to do is understand what the colors of the LED indicator on your ear pods case actually means because there are multiple different colors for this and you need to understand what that means so you can identify everything going on with your charging case so if it shows up as green as you can see mine right there that means that the case is fully charged if it's amber it's like an orange color that means it's less than one full charge remaining you may also see a solid red or a blinking red LED light and that just means that you are on very low like critical battery life like 1% and you need to charge ASAP and then finally you do also have a flashing white indicator which is usually when you press and hold this back button right here to pair a new device that just means that your ear pods are in pairing mode the next thing you guys should do is add the battery widget to your widgets section so go over on your home screen and go to the widgets section right here go all the way to the bottom to edit and then find batteries right there and tap on the little green plus and then you want to take that and drag it all the way to the very top hit done and now you will see your battery percentage at the very top and it shows your earpods battery percentage that way you don't have to constantly open up your air pods case just to see the battery percentage because that's normally what you do if the air pods were in here and you wanted to check the battery but now you could just go over on the widgets and always see the battery level of your air pods and it will do it for the case and also each individual air pod as well so it's very nice very handy to be able to see your battery percentage right there on the home screen you can also access this from the lock screen by just swiping over just like so and you can see it right there now another really cool feature that was included with iOS 13 then I think you guys should check out is called live listen so if you go into our settings and scroll down until we get to control center right here go to customize controls and down here you will see hearing it's a little blue ear right there you will see hearing right there go ahead and add that to the list of your control center toggle so then go ahead and swipe down to invoke the control center and you will see this right here go ahead and tap and press on that and you will see hearing and it says unavailable for current route that's because we don't have our air pods in so you want to put your air pods in and then we want to press where it says live listen off to turn it on and you can see right there it is on I'm gonna turn that off so I can explain this to you without hearing myself but basically what it does is you can hear what's near your iPhone it uses the microphone in side of your iPhone and it actually amplifies the volume around us so you can hear everything going on around your iPhone so you could technically set your iPhone like down state and go upstairs and be able to hear everything that's going on downstairs because your iPhone is using its microphone to relay that audio information to your air pods so it's a really cool way to pretty much stock people and you can really hear a lot of things it's a really cool feature especially if you're hard of hearing so just a really cool feature I think you should check out works really well with the air pods the next thing you guys should do is set up find my air pod so find my ear pods works just like Find My iPhone so if you were ever to lose one or both of these air pods or the case you would be able to locate it and play a sound just like you would with your iPhone so all you have to do is go to the find my application on your iPhone pull it up and then you will see you should at least see your ear pods probe right in there if not you can add them if you go ahead and tap on them you can see you get the option to play sound or get directions to where your air pots are located so definitely set that up so that you never lose your air pods and then the final thing you guys should do is just to remember what this button on the back of the case does there spend so many air pods owners that I've talked to especially in real life that have no clue there's a button on the air pods case it does kind of blend in and it's kind of sits really flush to the back so it's hard to see sometimes but that's how you can actually fix a lot of issues that's how you can pretty much hard reset your air pods and that will help with things like connection issues so if you aren't able to connect your air pods for whatever reason this could solve that you could repair them or if you wanted to connect to another device with a different Apple ID or if you wanted to connect to like an Android or anything that's how you do it you press and hold on that back button for about five to ten seconds it'll put it in pairing mode and then it should show up as discoverable when you're looking for Bluetooth devices so yeah guys there you have it those are the first 11 things you should do after getting your brand-new air pod pros if you guys have any other recommendations of things that you did when you first got your air pods feel free to leave them down in the comment section below and definitely stay tuned to the channel because I do have a video coming up on air pod pro tips and tricks that's coming out probably next week so definitely stay tuned to that if you want a little bit more in depth tips and tricks for the air pod pros but as for this video I hope you guys did enjoy it if you did make sure you give it a thumbs up also make sure to subscribe again so you don't miss any of my airpot pro videos I will the review the tips and tricks' all that fun stuff so definitely subscribe so you don't miss those videos but anyways guys thanks again for watching and I'll see you soon [Music]", "0lS10G-pSz4": "hello everyone so welcome to this month's open dialogue webinar session i'm allison rodgers i'm the editor here at collision repair magazine and i'm max reed i'm a staff writer here at the magazine so today we're here with chuck olson the senior vice president of automotive technology for air pro and kelly roberts the shop operations develop manager for air pro canada we're going to be taking a deep dive into advanced driver assistance system calibrations to discuss the difference between being 8 ass ready and 8as capable thanks for joining us today gentlemen uh could you just uh first of all good afternoon and could you just introduce yourselves yes so but uh yeah i'm chuck olson just to give me give you a background that's uh i've noticed a few names come up so what uh i i know quite a few people but uh uh my background in automotive started in about 1978 it's uh professionally before that i was hooked on automotive the first time i looked at the bottom of a matchbox car so i pretty much knew what i what i was going to do and uh uh had the opportunity to go through a lot of changes in technology uh through my career uh from uh you know computer-controlled engine controls when they were first introduced and uh and a lot of other technologies when airbags came out anti-lock brakes those kind of things uh working in a shop as a repair technician a diagnostic technician on the mechanical side uh and uh had the pleasure being involved in uh in onstar when those systems first came out installed some of those very first systems of at the cadillac dealerships and about 2011 2012 uh found myself more in the aftermarket and switched over to uh the needs of collision repair with all this new technology so it's uh i've been involved and uh got some experience under my belt in the collision repair space but uh definitely not a collision repair technician don't let me near a welder or a paint gun but when it comes to diagnostics electronics that we're here to help and kelly what about you oh kelly roberts and uh i've been in collision repair my whole life and uh i'll be in it until uh until i'm not in it anymore and uh fortunately i come from a family of traits people and my father was a collision repairer so in that the saying is i was born in the back of the shop which is not quite true but close enough that i've been in the environment since i was very young and i've been fortunate enough to to experience all the areas and you know saying an expert i've kind of got a little bit of a problem with being called an expert because i'm not an expert i'm i'm very good at a lot of things i've got a lot of experience but there really is a very hard target of being an expert nowadays especially with all of this technology and all the things that are coming at us you know when i started out not quite as as far back as chuck i i was in the i was in the 80s but i was still uh working on full-frame cars you know some people don't even really understand that concept you know a full-frame car uh and in my career so far the changes that that we've seen just in my career is is just staggering when you really look at the technology and the changes just in the last 20 years just in the last five to 10 years uh the speed of change uh it is very it's virtually difficult impossible uh to to be an expert in anything i think for me i am learning every day and i hope that i continue to learn more and more every day and then pass that knowledge along because that's what my dad and my uh friends in the trades are committed to doing is is to keep on educating keep on learning and keep on growing and improving so i'm glad to be here thanks for taking the time and and i look forward to this of course yeah well thank you so much kelly that's exactly here what we're talking here to talk about today i mean the difference between realizing you aren't an expert maybe at some things and taking the steps to try and be the best you can be at those so um that being said let's dive right into uh the presentation today uh so to start out what are some of the most overlooked aspects in uh when you're thinking about adas and calibrations in the collision repair market today well i'll take this one chuck i think the amount just the amount of information the amount of different circumstances you know starting out let's say that collision events they're they're unpredictable they're completely unpredictable they're completely chaos and then that process of really finding the information as it relates to what you're presented in in collision repair it's a lot it's a lot of information a lot of different avenues to go down uh and then the technology obviously so this slide here for example really shows it's a great slide because it shows kind of where we came from uh and where we are now and uh then we can start to talk about where we're going as well because we're not done yet you know they're they're still you know they're still talking about a lot of new and different technology than what we're already dealing with so this slide uh represents that basically in the first column what we have is a lot of the the basic systems of the base systems that have been around uh for for quite a while uh any lock break uh for example some of us may recall when anti-block brakes came out and and became relevant they became and then they started to grow in popularity and then became required to be uh put onto vehicles that were being presented to the north american market obviously uh airbag systems another big one uh i do recall back in the day taking an icar course in the 80s on on airbag systems and we'd never seen them before never heard of them or had to deal with them collision repairs so that's what that first column really shows is that the base or the starting point of the technology and then it grows into the systems uh in the next column that that come from and work with those so there's so there's integration in this slide as well that in those basic first column systems and then the growth into the next column of the technology those technology systems in the second column rely on the inputs rely on the information from those base systems so there's an ecosystem that's happening in this slide showing us that the technology grows and expands and then is still reliant upon those base systems like tire pressure monitor sensors for example uh chuck could tell you uh and i'll and i'll actually let chuck kind of maybe build that a bit on how you know tpms sensors are integral and and rely on uh other systems rely on those inputs of information feeds yeah and it does those are some great points there uh kelly and uh another big one that comes on here is the uh is a steering angle sensor steering angle sensors have been around for quite some time uh as a key input for stability control also for anti-lock brakes and then yaw rate accelerometers were added for stability control to improve those systems and as these systems developed and got uh very robust everything on the other side it is dependent on those systems operating correctly so if you've got these basics those these basic things that haven't been addressed and now we start getting into adas these safety related systems that drivers of vehicles are starting to rely on to operate properly you got to make sure those basics are are taken care of uh that feed all these other systems there's been a term that's been used called sensor fusion and it's really sensor and system fusion to where one system they're all networked together so one single system isn't a standalone system anymore like they used to be in the early days they were all separated now they're all integrated together and addressing all of these we'll see later on in the presentation what we're talking about here is integrating all these kind of things so that when you do get to the adas point the things are going to work you're going to get what you expected out of the process building a house from the foundation up versus trying to just jump onto the roof and then work our way backwards so we really have to focus on and understand that the integration is a system approach okay now before we delve too into into the weeds and all these things because obviously as we just saw there's hundreds of different sort of components going on when it comes to 8s and for a lot of shop owners when they hear eight asks they kind of stop listening they hear expensive and here takes up a lot of space so what would you say to a shop owner who's uh looking at the idea of offering eight ass services what what steps would you take to be eight ass ready yeah you're gonna have to find out where you are at this point uh and and what you need to address next so what uh and and with that that's really what uh what this 8-s ready uh slide is all about to find out where you're at and some some shops have been very progressive but so they they may have gone through all these steps right now and other shops maybe halfway through the process and others just wanting to start now with all this a dash rolling out it's unfortunately you're not going to go straight to 8s unless you've got the building blocks in place and this that's what this adas ready is all about so what uh i'm going to go go through some of the uh some of the basic points so the first thing you got to do is require uh capable scan tools or a capable service so that you can access these systems assess these systems just to find out where the trouble is is what i mean by a capable scan tool based on the work mix vehicles that you're working on that the scan tool is capable of seeing all those systems including data things that aren't related to dtcs and uh and those kind of things there's a lot of good scan tools out there but uh you have to know the capability go ahead kelly would it make sense you know kind of a rhetorical question would it make sense to look at really dive into what your work mix is and if you see some spikes in popularity of vehicles for your market area then look at that path look at what the requirements are for that and then start to really focus in and build from that consistency uh almost like a road map or a framework that you could apply in a process looking beyond uh into into more of your fringe area so so if you're doing a lot of domestic brand in your market area i know there's some market areas where they're they're truck heavy all they have is just you know chevys and dodge and ford pickup trucks and uh you know that wouldn't make sense to me as a shop owner or shop manager to to really look at my work mix to look at what we're doing the most of maybe your advertising is keyed in on it as well and be progressive and people proactive in in that decision versus just being overwhelmed by the onslaught of all the differences from making manufacturing model there's a ton so a point on it i think the work mix that you have historically is a great path to start to look at making those decisions yeah looking at work mix is going to come up several times as as we're discussing these things and uh of course the uh the next step is a technical expertise and uh education of the uh of the management staff so what are we doing when we're scanning a car we're doing a pre-scan doing a post scan i know that's been around for a while but uh uh you've got to be confident of that as uh as you move into adas and then uh of course the access to the service information and the repair procedures so you know service information is information that you have to have access for to solve a problem what a problem is with service information understanding how a system works then of course the repair procedure how do i execute a certain procedure whether it's so what do i have to do with the recovery what do i have to do you know with uh with frame repairs and those types of things with uh with the repair procedures and both of them are interdependent on each other as well from the repair procedures so and the service information so you have to have access to that and uh and that's a given and uh and able to navigate it so there's you know oem service information and then there's service providers that package a lot of oem service information uh and i'm sure everybody's got their favorite but you gotta have that if you don't have that referring to it through the process and uh with that being competent or pre and post scanning clearing the codes and doing function checks and this is about those basics those basic systems is all of that stuff working properly and have i done those basic things uh like the basic calibrations on the next step that you're proficient in them you know when they need to be done uh you have a tool capable of doing it and you have the technical expertise to to know how to navigate through the system and confirm that it's been done like your basic calibrations zeroing your yaw sensors when it needs to be done the steering angle sensor there's a lot of manufacturers that have a requirement even if you just disconnect the battery you need to do a steering angle sensor calibration after that battery disconnect so being aware of that service information and then finally in the uh being eight ask ready is identifying the eight ask calibration procedures that are going to be required so using a scan tool doing a pre-scan doing a post scan looking at dtcs that scan tools not going to independently tell you which adas calibration procedures are required you got to go to the service information what procedures did i perform what calls for that calibration and being able to identify them change up guys to think about it is we we i think that it's fair to say that we go to the estimating systems first and start to input the data there and look at those systems and i'm not knocking the system so great don't get me wrong but i i want you to almost visualize going to the service information first and looking at that information first uh and then using that as a resource to to input into to work the uh to work the other systems the reliance on the manufacturers uh information is is key it really is because what it's going to do is tell you a lot of uh free like setup or stage things that have to be done before you even move forward with doing anything else so it's that's that's key i want to add that of course yeah thanks kelly and uh and and you get to all those steps that's what we call adas ready and that's the designation of adas ready so you're ready to address these systems and at that point if you're doing all of those steps you have all those pieces in place and you can identify them then the next step and we're going to go through some stuff in the middle about diagnostics and the strategy but the adas ready gets you to the point i'm ready to partner with somebody to do my dash calibrations for me or i have dealer partnerships to do them for me and being ready when whether you send these things off or send them within your own department then you have increased your success rate of those calibrations exponentially uh by following up by following all the steps like i said whether you partner or you decide to become adas capable we'll go over some of the adas capable things later on in the in the presentation of course that's awesome sorry uh so could you guys just tell me uh you mentioned a little bit there uh could you just talk a little bit about the strategies that will get you all along the way on the uh on to getting me that's ready yeah go ahead well i think key for me was really understanding things when i needed to understand them versus having them present themselves to me as a as a matter of just happenstance so really taking advantage of lead time for example uh where i you know through repair planning would identify that i would need a resource i would need something to be done that that i did not have the ability to do internally i took advantage of the lead time of that knowledge to orchestrate that to to make sure that that was set up so again staging prepping whatever you want to call that that way i'm not being held to uh you know a short no notice schedule and and that ends up uh not working out well for anyone uh nobody wants to have something dumped on them uh i think everybody would be fair to say that if i can give you a heads up days in advance that this is coming at you then i'm going to get a better turnaround going to get a better result so again driving home that point of really following a process of of staging yourself out for the success it is possible it's it's not an impossibility there's a path to it so i mean identifying that path and then following it taking advantage of the information at the times that you need to take advantage of it versus having it come back at you and then trying to catch the raindrops with a teaspoon it just doesn't make sense so absolutely yeah so there's a strategy you can follow here absolutely all the way yeah and that's uh and for me the strategy of strategy-based diagnostics started really early in my career in the uh this slide it's uh with gm of how it came about of of observing technicians this was in the mechanical space and uh for warranty repair and customer service uh uh customer satisfaction indexes and the low rate of of of rechecks and observing what the strategy was for the technicians that were successful of that and uh uh it's been around uh from general motors and it's been adopted uh by by several segments of the repair industry as well uh because it is a very solid uh uh process and strategy uh and i've taken this what i've known about it and there's some unique uh challenges in collision that a lot of these in this strategy really didn't come up come up so it's uh we've i've added some steps and kind of rearranged things a little bit on strategy based diagnostics and shared it with people over the years uh to address this in collisions so what uh we'll go right on into uh the next slide on some of these steps i'm good so what uh the first is you know understanding and verifying areas of concern well in the mechanical environment we usually have a customer come to us and tell us this is what's wrong with my car this is my problem this is my complaint and uh in collision environment it's gonna you know my car's crashed so now you've got another challenge there because there's going to be several things with vehicles that you really don't know about the customer doesn't know about uh so you're a little bit behind the eight ball there at the beginning so you need to just obtain as much information as possible from the customer and then from the vehicle itself uh to uh observe this beyond what it is that you can see right in front of you you know which is going to be the damage and that can be challenging in itself of uh knowing what to do to take care of the damage that that's done correctly but then we got some additional steps and uh of course the pre-scan stage was performing a diagnostic check uh and this will help you verify the uh the operation of the systems that are embedded in the vehicle a lot of things that you can't see then you want to record the diagnostic trouble codes and the information associated with them so as you're going your steps forward you're discovering what it is that you're going to have to diagnose and uh developing your strategy going forward uh and this information is going to help guide the technician of what the next steps that they have to take in uh building that uh repair blueprint uh kelly you've had a few situations of that too where that's really headed off some things that uh you know on delivery day prevented problems right absolutely and just to to expand on your first point about understanding and verifying areas of concern as collision repairs for people that service automobiles considering technology that's involved the sensitivity of the technology uh i would suggest very strongly that we adopt a mindset that the entire vehicle is an area of concern now the transference of energy again there's sensitivity electronics we've got electronic autonomous vehicles uh different materials different manufacturing types material it's literally you need to step back and look at the whole vehicle and like chuck said have uh very valuable very good discussions with with the owner have a discussion with the vehicle as crazy as that sounds and make sure that we pay attention to to the entire vehicle all of those things with an understanding of those items that need to be understood prior to moving forward again so as we get that information on the vehicle 2019 model xyz pull start pulling that information before the vehicle even arrives you have the opportunity of the assignment first notice the loss start that information exchange start to download that mindset that you need to have identifying those areas because like chuck had mentioned that will prevent being in a situation where having to react to something a reaction is always slower and it's it's tends to be messier uh and it and it doesn't it's not a guarantee of a the correct result reaction is is not the way to to repair vehicles we need to be proactive do things on purpose with the purpose that we that we uh realize when we do all these uh exercises all these efforts of understanding what we're up against and then identifying them through inspections like diagnostics uh pre-scan postscan the scan itself being a part of diagnostic not the whole thing so so i want to really drive that point home yeah and and that'll take you on to uh uh the next slide so you gather some information and uh you gotta do your your preliminary checks and uh uh part of this has been part of the uh process and collision repair uh before but conducting a thorough visual inspection and then uh reviewing the history of the vehicle whatever you can find whether you get that information from the owner or whatever as you're doing these preliminary checks uh are there unusual sounds i mean if the engine can be ran and uh uh you hear a noise from into the drive area that's another clue for uh of of checking into those situations that you're not gonna find from a scan or a scan tool but you're starting to build procedures that you have to do and uh uh odors it's like do you smell cool and do you smell oil do you smell something that's going to prompt you to go further into your inspection so that uh you don't miss things and and also when you find these things is there physical damage that's contributing to that uh to that condition so you need to be able to uh uh tie those things together like a uh a low battery voltage is a uh is a good indicator of that so as you look into these in your inspection as low battery condition because something happened to the vehicle uh something was damaged or is the battery simply four or five years old and due for replacement uh so you need to investigate these things as a part of the preliminary checks and again how long do the conditions last and how often did they occur did it start from uh from the collision did they come in and last but not least are there after market accessories contributing to the conditions and that condition you know maybe some diagnostic trouble codes or network communication codes that are being caused by aftermarket accessories put on the vehicle and uh and as we kind of go through this and uh uh an observation that i've made that uh there are some shops a lot of it i like to call the one percenters there may be a few more than that out there but shops that currently have skilled electronic diagnostic technicians on staff have already recognized this need uh and uh and getting involved with these on these uh vehicles and uh those shops that have that personnel on staff are very fortunate to have those diagnostic technicians on staff as well uh not to mention the uh uh the skilled technician labor gap uh that is in that area as well so what uh and that's just a good point so if you've got all those other tools in place and a technician to address them uh that's a very good point and uh also to put in this and this is the other big challenge with strategy-based diagnostics at a collision event is a lot of these steps may not be possible depending on the condition of the vehicle uh you may have to do some repairs on that vehicle to get it to a point where it can be operated normally either during the repair and possible at the end of the repair of whatever your results from your inspection and scan results are uh so that you can go forward and then uh uh last but not least on this uh pre stuff is check for related bulletins uh so if there's a bulletin related uh to a vehicle or a recall and uh it's a really easy one to use as uh i'm sure just about everybody out there is aware of takata airbag recalls on the vehicle uh you've got a vehicle comes in the airbag lights on i know we've all heard this story my car was perfect before it was involved in an accident everything's related to the accident but if you have a recall or a preliminary service information or service bulletin that is not directly related to it that is valuable information to have now you can have a discussion with your customer of where that responsibility lies does that responsibility lie with the customer does it lie with the manufacturer and you're addressing that up front rather than that being an expectation at the end of the repair and the customer is aware of it kelly you've been through quite a few situations to where that's popped up well i think that you know for a csi standpoint we go i could go back to the mindset of the entire vehicle being the area of concern um as a customer uh you know when i had somebody that was looking at you know and treating uh the whole person or the whole vehicle i felt a lot more comfortable with that person because they didn't just put blinders on and go right to that point of impact and then be very specific uh you know when when i care about your whole vehicle i think that for me i would get the opportunity to extend my care in in possible further situations because during that situation at that time i showed that i did care about the rest of the vehicle the whole vehicle and the people involved obviously and you know it's safety related items as well and part of the certification networks uh i know with the takata and the pro first honda they had sent out circulars speaking to about how to address those situations let's face it guys there's a lot of recalls out there right now manufacturers are are are upping the game as far as taking care of these issues and and getting that information out there be part of that process for your customer and show that you care about their whole vehicle and you care about them as a whole and they're going to care about you is that simple absolutely that's a good one yup great so from this point we're going to get a little bit uh more into the deeper end of the pool especially when it comes to diagnosis and electronic diagnostics and information that we got from the scan tool of these things kind of moving forward uh so these are some steps that have been uh pretty well documented uh uh previously in other diagnostic systems but uh a current dtc that's the current fault uh so uh it is there it's showing current it's something that's not not clear so now you need to look at the uh the diagnostic trouble code for that list on that vehicle and uh follow the diagnostic steps so you may have a few extra things that you have to do in those sets whether they be additional visual inspections uh you may possibly have to do some disassembly as uh some further disassembly as you follow through through those tests and this one's kind of important it's related back to the pre-scan post scan the things that you're looking at you pull out the vehicle is you can have a symptom with no dtc that a scan tool and additional testing equipment may be needed to investigate uh further so there's several appropriate system symptom diagnostic chart so you know like a fuel gauge being an operative or display being an operative in a vehicle so if you have a dtc that points to that and gives you an area of diagnostic steps to follow that's a good thing but you may not have and you may have to use the scan tool looking at data uh finding a fault with a beat with a vehicle so a diagnostic trouble code is a symptom as well as something being inoperative that doesn't send a diagnostic trouble code and both of those are in the fault category there's a uh there's a fault with the vehicle and then uh there's situations to uh and this is where diagnosticians that have done this for a while is you've got a condition that there are no published diagnostics at that point you've got to analyze the concern and develop your own plan for the diagnostics of that system and that may involve reading schematics understanding the proper operation of how that particular system works what is normal what is not normal and then uh understanding the difference between an intermittent or a history dtc that have certain conditions that cause them to set a a very uh uh simple explanation of some of these which uh may appear to be an intermittent diagnostic trouble code is with uh rear park assist sensors so you can have a rear park assist sensor that uh isn't working properly and it's not active while that vehicle's in park so you can clear codes you can look the system everything looks perfectly normal until you start that car up and put it reverse and then when the system becomes active then it will check itself and if you have a poor connection a connection not seated all the way or something like that that system may not set a code until you're in reverse and go over a bump so you you need to uh understand the differences of these diagnostic categories of what it is you're looking for as you solve these problems kelly you got anything to add in that area yeah really key uh chuck i think is if we look at the workflows of diagnostic workflows that a lot of them refer to recreating the additional or the original conditions that uh that inspire the default the dtc uh so so bear that in mind a good point like you said with the park assists those are not going to operate until they're put into the condition that that requires them to operate and then self-test to make sure that they're functioning so uh i i again will drive home that point of really researching and understanding the information on what requirements they are uh we can drive home the point of test drives and those kinds of things beyond just you know does the stereo work and you know does the steering wheel go straight there's more to it yeah that's an excellent point kelly about the um the conditions keeping an eye on that i mean that's such an important part that i feel like is overlooked in the industry too often so uh so this one and and again coming back to the challenge with the uh with the damaged vehicles and there's a a lot of work and partnerships between uh diagnostic shops whether it be uh remote technicians mobile technicians working with the dealership or diagnostic shop but uh the uh and and again that additional challenge is guys and mechanical shops are used to pattern-based failures things that wear out for wear and tear and normally don't encounter a lot of the uh the component failures that happen from a collision uh from the routine there are some that would specialize in that area uh but the technicians are a lot of understanding of what was damaged and so and i car coined this phrase a while back called the collision advantage so whether you're working with partners or you have a diagnostic specialist it's very important for them to know where the damage was what happened to the vehicle what parts i replaced what i did to it so that they have that advantage of of the diagnostic steps that they're going to take because that's all valuable information that's all data as well that you're collecting in order to get to the diagnostic of that vehicle a lot of times people think of data of just what the scan tool tells you but what you see here know about the vehicle that's all data to be collected and critical in uh correcting those uh collision collision-related faults so what uh and kind of going forward some of these other steps and uh again some of these are are covered very well in the uh the original strategy based diagnostics uh but evaluating the symptoms and conditions as described by the customer and we out of the part were observed by the technician because again this customer there may be damage to this vehicle that the customer isn't even aware of yet they've got a damaged vehicle they brought it into repair that might be different if they drove it for a couple of weeks may be able to give you some additional information uh but understanding the proper operation and if you don't know uh uh look in the owner's manual uh find out how a system is supposed to work if there's a vehicle you're unfamiliar with uh go to the service information and read the description and operation of the system if you're not familiar with it and then follow the procedures whatever the procedures are on those systems that you're evaluating for testing uh or intermittent conditions and uh uh sometimes this will go beyond what you can find out with the scan tool you may need to do voltage checks with a voltmeter or check circuits with a test lamp or do some of the initial testings and only you can tell with what your shop capabilities are it can i execute this test and come to a conclusion or do i need to partner with somebody or someone for uh for that repair and uh kelly you had uh you'd gone through a lot of this stuff and uh kind of learning as as as it went right yeah and and you know to tie it back to to the main topic if we don't do these things if we don't follow these steps guys then when we go to do that calibration thinking that uh you know it's going to be successful and we're going to be happy and and everything's going to be fine uh only to realize that you know we've got to stop we've got to go back to the start and we've got to apply so so we really need to understand drive home the point that in order to perform the end game you know being the calibration and producing that proper result then then there's a path there's steps that we have to follow and one of my favorite sayings you know i i say this too often is that everything that has to happen will happen and and where i learned was uh you know when i was doing it at the wrong time so you know something would come back and that and i'd learned that that step did not belong at the end it belonged you know halfway halfway through so again everything that has to happen to perform calibrations must happen in the time that it that it is supposed to happen uh otherwise you're just into that you know comebacks situation failures safety issues all the way that's a cycle i mean you're gonna keep experiencing that if you don't cycle yeah and and as you go through those steps is what that's going to do is uh that gets you here into step nine of isolating root cause so i've done inspections i found different things to the vehicle and then you're gonna make that repair and verify whatever the correction is and when it comes to isolating the root cause of working through you know the dtcs and those kind of things you may have a problem that shows up in the left front of the vehicle uh that was damaged in the right rear of the vehicle but there's a ground in the right rear of the vehicle and uh as as we look at this and have been supporting collision repair shops you know over the last uh six seven years uh we have seen that the majority of the cases that uh that we have during the collision repair isolating down to a root cause especially when it's collision related or repair related is going to be loose terminal pins uh connectors that aren't fully seated bent terminal patterns i mean these these terminal pins are very small with the smaller wiring as well and uh as you isolate those root causes and go in and look at them the other one is painted over grounds or loose ground so those are the most prevalent those aren't the only things that you're going to run into of course there's going to be broken components components that are damaged that uh that you isolate earlier on in the process and then once you do those repairs is re-examine the concern and uh there's points that come up to where if you can't successfully find or isolate you may have to go back to earlier steps in the process and look again uh so uh none of us are perfect when it comes to doing diagnostics and uh sometimes you have to repeat quite a few of those steps and then uh kelly it's uh we've worked through this a lot uh with the was with the final step number 11 of how important this is on qc so i'd like you to expand on that with the uh with the final step of repair verification yeah how do we know that what we did in fact uh correctively corrected the fall corrected the problem fixed the vehicle healed the patient whatever language you want to put to it until we verify that that it is in fact uh correctly correctly done then then we can't move forward that has to be the final step uh in in making sure that you can move forward and not have to have something come back down the road and and then start over where do we start so uh again in the in the full diagnostic process uh a scan is is one part of it repair verification is another part of it and you may need to apply that verification part of the process several times depending on the severity of the collision that presents depending on the situations that present and again that repair verification may require you to actually recreate the conditions uh normal operating conditions of that vehicle so so a very big part of it is i think you know chocolate might have a difference in opinion here but no not not not at all it's like that's the whole thing it's almost the whole thing it really is because without documentation i mean the dreaded l word can come up too we don't even want to get it yeah the thing that we don't want to beat to death but nonetheless it's always there liability as an asset means that we understand and we eliminate the possibility by liability of liability by applying that repair process that diagnosis that strategy-based diagnostic process and we verify that in fact the vehicle is performing as it should as per spec as per oem uh all of those things yeah excellent all right perfect yeah and uh tana that's something that we really don't have in here though that is very critical especially uh in the collision repair environment it's uh it's always been important like on a free measure a post measure to make sure that the vehicle is straight and now that's part of the verification as well that would be a step of of a verification that i did get a vehicle straight you don't verify that vehicle straight this is directly related to uh doing being eight ass ready and getting to the point of adas capable where you're gonna do it yourself that if that vehicle is not straight the a dash portion of the calibrations is not going to be successful mm-hmm back to the start we got to pull the vehicle back apart we've got to take everything back off and we got to do what we should have did at the start in the first place yeah yeah exactly it's a circuit all right awesome so i mean once where we've secured that strategy i mean it's obviously something that that doesn't happen overnight but uh it's a step towards becoming eight ass capable versus eight house ready so i mean with this strategy we've outlined here chuck and kelly are there any further challenges that uh shops could face as they progress along this journey to becoming adas capable and beyond that capability absolutely i think you know to jump in and take that point one of the challenges is just the over overwhelming amount of information that's that's involved um one of the most concerning things that i heard uh recently was that we've got situation where we incentivize repair planners to generate as many sheets as possible on a daily basis so what we're looking at is we're looking at a cycle time of generating estimates of repair plants you know based off of a time frame expectation and that's unrealistic uh you know if you as you start to really review the information you'll see that just you know a a bumper job i've seen that very recently on some some information where changing on a mirror on a vehicle for example uh takes a tremendous amount of review of information involved because of the technology but also because of the integration of that technology into the other systems so so the prerequisites required before even starting to perform those um that is a that is a fundamental challenge there is no smart system out there that's going to tell you everything you need to do you have to participate there's a huge push on artificial intelligence as be all end all and be caught i would caution be very careful uh in in relying on uh systems that that are our so-called smart systems that are going to do it all for you um we're not there yet and again it's just a tremendous amount so so that's a challenge that's the challenges i think being given the amount of time that it takes to do a full and thorough repair plan it's very challenging i've wrote articles on it and it is a significant challenge where we have a tremendous amount of pressure to move through these situations as quickly as possible when you're moving fast the the tendency to miss things is very easy mm-hmm the main challenges are pretty much uh uh covered in this uh in this list from the different methods the different tools the different space requirements depending on if it's a radar system a camera system and you can have differences even within the same make and sometimes within the old model depending on mid-year model changes and you know that brings us right back to the basics of the service information and checking it every time but that is a big challenge of uh that we have in this area and the the availability of all the oem special pools uh they can be limited they're not always available some of them you have instructions on how to make them from some oems uh some of them that you have to source them and then uh of of course there's universal target kits that are out there and they've been improving over the last few years uh they can be quite expensive some of them uh some of them are uh are a bit more more reasonable but they don't yet cover all the situations for all makes and all models i mean ground is being gained there uh and with some of these systems that you're gonna need and we talked about this in scanning with the scan tool the software functions vary by manufacturer uh and uh some of these are advanced advanced functions as well if it's a very late release model vehicle having access to the oem uh uh scan tool applications uh would be absolutely necessary especially on a late model release vehicle and uh you know this could go back two three or four model years depending on the system that you're addressing and of course the other challenge there's new features and systems that uh are on the way we're hearing about new stuff uh lidar may be gaining some prevalence in the system and that'll have a different uh procedure with it as well versus radar sublime spots and forward facing cameras and there's a 360 as well x-ray oh man x-ray vision there we go yeah and uh this this is a question that uh that i've been hearing uh quite a bit this specification comes up and it kind of depends on what you're what you're going to be addressing to be as capable we talked about work mix before uh but if you're going to be taking on all makes of vehicles and uh all the calibrations you're gonna need to address all of these a 350 minimum uh the suggestions 4 000 square feet uh for all makes and models and this you know this is just the space uh of course the floor should it needs to be level and should replace that word should the floor you do need to have a level of a surface and not remain non-reflective uh because of you know having reflective services is going to be problematic uh while you're doing a dense calibration especially with a camera recognition and uh the walls free of reflective materials and contrasting patterns uh these these cameras key on contrasting patterns so with the you know it's uh the black and white checkerboard floors are cool to look at and a nice thing but would be a disaster if uh if you're trying to do 8s calibrations with camera recognition and one of the things that has been employed with some other shots with some smaller spaces is using a blind uh so and i've seen a lot of these you know in shops to where you know from welding and those kind of things that if you do have something in the background that a blind can be put behind the vehicle on the appropriate space to take care of that neutral tone again solid color wall coatings beige or gray and uh another key part of this that feeds into a lot of adas calibrations is consider having alignment equipment uh because most of us if you have an alignment dominance equipped with adas you're going to have a requirement to do a knee pass calibration and one of the steps in doing an adas calibration is verifying that the alignment is within spec before you go forward uh so they're in the interdependent on each other um and if uh i'm going to go back to work mix until you can go a little bit further on this if uh your space doesn't necessarily need to be that large if you're looking at one or two mains so then you have to look at what's my space requirements for these and if you have a larger space you can do a left side the right side without moving the vehicle but you can compensate for those through the left side move the vehicle set the vehicle up it takes a little bit longer work to do those things uh but those are some things that uh you can accommodate some of the workspace requirements depending on what your work mix is and what you're going to be calibrating kind of a rabbit hole but i'll stay out of it we're as collision industry fairly used to this idea of dedicated workspace dedicated work environments inside of that dedicated work environment and i think i'll say this strongly collision repairs need to get used to this because as we start to see composite materials composite repair types aviation driven construction methods all really circling around electric vehicles light weighting you have to imagine that the you know the strength of the vehicles to support the internal combustion engines uh is changing the the structural designs the materials used so in that along that path get used to seeing more and more of these requirements of having very specific controlled environments for certain types of materials and methods of repair carbon fiber is is a a growing concern um things like magnesium has been around for a long time it's it's a it's a dangerous uh dangerous proposition if you don't understand dealing with it aluminum uh was a big one we're talking aluminum rooms aluminum specific uh materials think along those same lines and and the chuck's point about uh work mix but also um be fair to say that they're you know i'll throw this back at you chuck would it be fair to say that there's there's some calibrations that are i don't want to say easier i want to say that are more open to say uh constraints of of space and and area available in the shop environment yeah and one of the big ones that requires a quite a bit of space is your 360 view camera calibrations so maybe you have enough space that you can take care of the radar calibrations forward-facing cameras blind spot uh but you may need to sublet gesture 360 view camera calibrations uh so looking at those calibrations and uh in that point uh as well so that that's a really good observation there of what it because each one of them is different and has a little bit different setup a little bit different space requirements and uh those types of things so and uh one of the the other considerations take place is if your shop if you are part of a uh oem certification requirement especially one that is managed uh directly from the oem it uh and you're going into this area you need to check with those certification requirements of what you signed up for of what i said that i would do of taking these on so there may be oem specific scandal applications that you're required to have uh with that certification program uh so you need to make sure that you abide by that or oem specific kits or certain requirements uh for uh for radars and cameras to address whether you're addressing them directly or you're or if you are subletting them out i mean you as a repair it's you send it out to get it done even with the sublet you're still responsible for that repair and it's up to you to make sure that who you subled it to are also following uh uh the direction and instruction that you need to get um uh having a requirement for the oem service information access uh and and this would be specific subscriptions depending on the uh of the oem certification program that you're on and it may require a lenovo dealership sponsorship as well so as you're considering this you do want to consider whatever oem certification uh program that your shop is part of as you're making these decisions excellent yeah are we gonna are we gonna zoom right into it yeah i think so we're about to head into a q a period here guys so i just want to say thank you to chuck and kelly for helping us before we close all this out for telling us all this such useful information today on adis calibrations and just readying yourself for the massive eight ass waves that are still to come i mean we're still seeing more technology every single day so be sure you guys have those questions prepared we're going to take about five or ten minutes to answer those um but yeah i'll hand it back over to max to close it on out here for us so yeah i've obviously as we've we've outlined all the steps we've talked about strategies we've uh uh and the requirements of course and we know eight ass is nothing to no you can't wing eight ass essentially uh how can how can shops know where they stand in terms of being capable of eight ass calibrations yeah so uh going over that so you're already asked ready you've got all the requirements you've got an understanding of strategy-based diagnostics we felt strategy-based diagnostics was really important uh as you get to the uh to doing your calibrations just to increase your success rate so of course you're going to be confident identifying the needs and procedures you've identified and prepared your work space for whatever work mix it is that you're going to have uh here's an important step is identifying your test drive routes uh so make sure that especially with the dynamic calibrations which is while driving the vehicle uh that the the environment or the test drive route around you that you'll be able to meet those requirements so there may be some that you can do and some that you can't do uh on those limitations that uh that you won't identify and then acquiring your calibration targets based on the repair mix and what's calibration going to take you're going to have to require those uh those targets and there's quite a few sources they're becoming much more prevalent now to where they can get uh consult your service information for the vehicle setup and what the calibration procedures are going to be for you to become familiar with those uh as you set up your workspace and purchase your equipment and then uh last month performing the calibrations and documenting the specific procedures that you performed not only in this area in the adas i mean there is an area of liability but the documentation for the entire workflow is very important as well and if you get to a point to where an 8s calibration is not successful that documentation can bring it back to where the failure point would be and i just want to add it but at this when you're 8 as capable doing an eight as calibration is not that difficult the difficult part is making sure that you are ready you've done all the pre-work it's just like painting a room it's easy to paint a wall but if you don't do the prep work wash the wall do the masking all that kind of stuff now it's a pain and it's probably not going to turn out how you expect it so what uh that's a pretty simple analogy but you get through those steps you are you are eight at and you may only be eight as capable in two manufacturers because you don't see enough of the other manufacturers or you may not have the workspace requirement to fit those other so 8as capable is also going to progress depending on how many manufacturers and what systems that you address ellie i'll let you let you kind of close it out there i just want to drive home that point about consulting that service information and like you said but i'll take it a step further and say it's like painting a vehicle [Music] everybody looked at the paint job saying man that's a great paint job to say no it's an awesome prep job yeah the paint looks great but it comes from something so being able to perform calibrations it comes from these things and it's building up to that point and there is a path there are steps to follow there are resources there's guys like chuck there's people out there that that are committed to making sure that you have this information uh and we're not going anywhere we're we're committed to to being that resource into providing this information and providing that path uh and when you really see the path i mean start moving down it nice and easy and and you can see the outcomes you can see that paint job as you're prepping it it'll all feel good in the end yeah exactly well thank you guys so much today for taking the time to chat with us we've got some questions rolling in already so got one from uh paul viveros he is saying i'm sure we're all aware of the fca secure gateway module uh what's the best way to deal with this as a shop do you believe more manufacturers will follow suit with similar similar securities in the coming years that's a that's a chuck question all day long and and and i'm sorry i hate to ask you to repeat that i missed the very first part out of the money yeah you just said we're all aware of the fca secure gateway module what's the best way to deal with this as a shop and do you believe more oems will follow suit yeah this is a little bit beyond adas but uh the sca secure gateway module was one of the the first ones to add an encryption key that comes from the oem server that needs to be registered with the scan tool uh and that verifies that the scan tool that you indeed license the information depending on who the maker is and once that is registered it does a handshake with the oem and unlocks that secure gateway module uh and we're going to see more secure gateway modules they're not going away different oems take different approaches to secure gateway modules and uh that's to uh to keep the nefarious actors uh out of our vehicles uh data streams and uh being able to hack into a vehicle and make changes or take over vehicles while it's running it ensures that the vehicle is in a service state when you're using a scandal to make commands or uh clear things or do certain calibrations and or programming it's a hot topic falls into a lot of the there's a lot of organizations varying right now for your data your choice in canada we know the right to repair in the states i mean yeah that's a big topic we've definitely been looking at recently sorry kelly i think i'm gonna cut you off there if you wanted to weigh in on that no no you you said it that that's the way it's going as as we see this access uh consumer data access um it makes sense to give access to anybody to get into the base architecture and software these vehicles and uh like use chuck had said bad actors that may want to do something that none of us really wants maybe just that one person that we don't want to have access so we got to be really careful i think securing the information securing the gateway um putting guards at the door uh isn't saying that we we don't want to have access we just got to make sure that we're not creating the wild west here and just letting anyone and everyone get in there and do whatever they want so we should be very careful absolutely you know i spotted a question in the uh in the chat yeah i just got in front of me i was just reading through the chat so i picked up this one at what point would you consider a feature of a vehicle to fall under eight ass category and this is from uh d grand uh yeah it's uh it falling under the category of of advanced driver assistance system and there's been a lot of discussion at this so when are these systems mainstream and just become driver assistance systems or not if there's something new that's going to be advanced but at this point in time anything that has the capability to either warn the driver of a driving situation or take control like automatic emergency braking or lane keep assist or blind spot assist or those kind of things of of the definitions i have those are those are an eight ass category now all of the other things that we talked about early on in the presentation of all the networking and the systems are going like a steering angle sensor is a is a steering angle sensor an adas component no it's a primary component on the vehicle but the adas is reliant on that steering angle sensor brake pedal position sensor or whatever it is to be operating properly for that adas function to even be considered that's operating properly yeah we've got another statement here that says every connector touch to r and i replace or just to get out of the way is photographed mainly for the tech to ensure the necessity of making the reconnects just about documentation here about the reassembly process so good on you jim byron for having your text with that process that's great uh we've got john shoemaker here as well uh yeah john schumacher he's got he says i recommend the shops to look at their top five manufacturers or their top three oem certifications so absolutely and we're looking at that repair mix there in the form of odds but eat ass rather sorry um yeah we've got a lot of questions a lot of comments here saying thank you got a lot of information here in this webinar so thank you guys so much again i think that's all we've got for questions but if anyone has any other questions that you'd like answered by chuck or kelly feel free to send them to the collision repair mag team and we will be sure to pass them along if they need answering and you can always reach out to air pro diagnostics they will always reach out they will always be available to speak and here let me just go back to our slides and i can pull kelly and chuck's uh contact information up on the screen there so feel free to reach out to them or screenshot this message right now if you want to uh reach out but thank you guys so much yeah thank you guys thank you so much for the opportunity that's uh enjoyed it yeah awesome well we'll we'll have a recording of the webinar sent out to everyone that watched anyone who missed it and uh yeah for everyone else have a great uh wednesday what tuesday what day is it today tuesday my bad thanks everybody all right have a great day everyone bye thanks for watching this was a media matters production if you liked what you saw check out our other videos follow our socials and subscribe for more you", "55aLYyEBYLU": "I wanted to show you all this so fern SPE 36 this is a BLF special edition with that in drill firmware that's getting so popular really liking that user interface very nice I brought these other two cans sized and style lights because I feel like this dc-7 by air Pro is somewhat close to what we're looking at here with this SP 36 and also had this ole ix7 for quite a while and it's another can light that is somewhat similar to the SP 36 we're gonna get these three out and look at them here in a little bit give you all an idea what they do at night give you all an idea of what some beam shots would look like between the three I'm going to go ahead and pull these two off to the side because the main thing that we're talking about right now is this SP 36 this is a special edition this user interfaces special the LEDs are special everything is just special let's go ahead and look at it I want to show y'all this thing on its lowest power setting I obtained that by holding down on it from going from off to on you hold down and it starts the dim stepless dimming and releasing and then holding back down you go back down if you just go ahead and hold down and then release really quick you'll come on in the lowest setting all of this is really easy to memorize no problems learning this user interface any light that I've had with this unit user interface like the very first one that I ever had I had this pretty much mastered in about a week to two weeks time that's the turbo I just obtained that by double press we're gonna go ahead we're going to talk about this LED and the switch right here that can be adjusted by seven clicks what I just did is I went ahead and switched it over into a brighter level it was a little bit more dim we're gonna press it seven times again and now it should be flashing we're kind of like in a beacon setting and kind of flashes dimly and then brighter I like that setting it's really cool looking if you're gonna be putting this in a cup holder driving around and maybe putting it on the counter in the kitchen you want to be able to find it at night that's pretty cool looking and then that's off that can all be obtained in the instruction manual that I'm fixing to show you the instruction manual is really handy with this thing the next thing that I want to show you is so I've already showed you how it does the dimming the next thing is three presses we're flashing out the level of the batteries right now so you just count it up one two three point so in a a 3.8 is where the battery is right now and then a double press brings it up into sunset mode and let's go ahead while we're doing this just to kind of give you guys an idea of this manual I'm not gonna read all these words to you but what I am gonna show you is this little map if you will so user interface diagram is gonna show you everywhere that you want to go with this flashlight so where we are right now is we just from off to three clicks to battery check we just did to fast click see how the green line to fast clicks up to sunset mode that's what we're in right now sunset mode is gonna come on at that level slowly dim itself down and then eventually turn itself completely off that's a duration of about 30 minutes now we're gonna double press go into beacon mode beacon mode is gonna do exactly what you see right there and flash that out if you want to adjust that you find that four clicks will bring you into a an area where you can adjust the rate of the beacon flashing i've got other videos showing this user interface showing how we do the temperature thermal configuration showing how we adjust that beacon mode just wanted to give you all a run-through of some of the things that this is offering so right now it's flashing out the temperature that the light is at everything is pretty much self-explanatory this manual is going to come with this light so four clicks is going to lock it out five clicks is going to be Terry six clicks is muggle mode which means you can't get to turbo and it takes away a couple things and then there's all the different strobes strobes can be obtained by click click and hold so you one two three you hold on the third time right now it is in candle mode it's kind of like a light flickering you can hold down and make it brighter double press and hold makes it dimmer and then you can double press and go all through all those different options same user face is quite a few lights that I have so easy to operate and in about a week's time you won't even be looking at this thing anymore at least that's how it was for me so if I can handle this user interface I have a lot of confidence in pretty much everybody that is a brief over look at this light while it's viewable we're going to get out in the dark one other thing I will say in case I forget to say it in the dark I'm using Samsung 30 Q batteries in this thing you can't open it up right there you can only open it up where I'm opening it all the batteries all the cells drop down just like that using some button tops and if memory serves me correctly I believe you can only use button tops if I'm wrong on that hit it up in the comments or I'll check on that when I'm done with this video and I will adjust that in the description then the other thing is this is a type C charging port which I really like comes with a little cable faster charging and easier access to these cables because that's what everybody's phones are now taking that's what my phone takes that's pretty handy not a bad deal the feel of the light is really grippy right here those three little areas that you see there provide good solid grip and then you have some like ribbing I guess you would call it or you know sinking to keep it cool up here and it does a really good job keeping cool by the way it doesn't get too hot we're gonna get it out and put it on turbo and see how it does for a length of time get it out in the dark it got dark so here's the SP 36 in the middle on moonlight mode there is the Oh light X 7 on its lowest setting in moonlight it's looking awfully bright let me double-check that for y'all just to make sure turn it off hold it down lowest setting yeah it's just just a little bit brighter I don't remember it being so bright with these newer lights with this newer user interface the moonlight levels are so much lower and then here's the air Pro dc-7 and I know that's in its lowest setting confident of that I just wasn't sure about that o light X 7 but it is it's in its lowest setting we're gonna look down into this retention pond here at the very far end of this retention pond is a hundred feet we're gonna start out with the air Pro dc-7 and quite a bit of a throat beam on this dc-7 it's got good spill out to the side but you're gonna see that it's a little bit more of a thrower than the x7 that we're gonna bring up now this is by a light and the first double press is not its maximum potential its maximum potential is going to be on the next double press there is the claimed 9,000 lumen by oli x7 definitely a flood compared to the last one that you just saw and then let's go ahead and get this SP 36 up here and double press what I'm seeing is this is it good in between this is going to be a good throw with enough spill out to the sides to where I'm flooding out the and you know size of the pond retention pond here so it's a good in between what you just saw with those other two this thing is starting to get a little bit warm I'm starting to watch my seconds now I want to see how long it takes to just get absolutely ridiculous for me to touch I am holding it all the way at the very end I've not done any thermal regulation on this as I stated before we're rolling with this thing straight out the package the factory specs were good enough for where I wanted this thing I didn't want it getting too crazy hot really liking that it's not getting too ridiculously hot were up to 30 seconds now actually beyond a little bit still doing really good for full power I'm happy with that Samsung 30 q batteries they're always going to be one of my favorites my next favorite is going to be the sony bt ce 6 shining up this whole retention pond here no problem and we're out of a minute beyond a minute still holding it and it has gotten considerably warmer but not too hot to handle I mean I've got my fingers all the way to the the light as you can see and it's handling it good light good job so fern really appreciate the user interface on this thing it never did get ridiculously hot just cutting this short that way I'm not making y'all board there it is right there the sofa and SPE 36 with the end rule thank you all for watching if y'all got any questions or comments hit it up appreciate you", "tGlaQ-_FVts": "what is up guys I'm bringing your video that I haven't seen at least time I

Tim I wanted to talk about one of my favorite cartridges we have here at Saints this is the arrow pro cartridge it's kind of a little bit unique a little bit different from a lot of the other cartridges we have the first thing is that uses a different battery and it's really cool because it's magnetic so you just drop it in there and it just slides right in and stays really easy to switch them out if you have different cartridges indica and sativa for example I like this one here is jack hair it's a really energetic sativa I like it for when I have stuff to do I'm going about my day or cleaning the house it just gives you that energy to keep going the focus guys are great they're great price come check them out at Saints you", "6c-pDjziOhE": "[Music] yo what's going on guys it's your boy serrano welcome back to the channel as always we're going to do an unboxing now today's unboxing has to do with the airpods three however this one is actually a completely cloned out version one of the newest models but the box looks exactly like the airpods pro box now as you guys know i have reviewed a ton of airpod clones on this channel over over a dozen of them so i have a lot of clones all on that side is just all clone earbuds so you can see these are the older ones right here and this box was not um you know it didn't resemble the airpods box it was it was just its own box with the airpods clone on there but this box looks exactly like the airpods 3 so we're going to be checking this out in today's video and i'm kind of excited to see what features this brings on the on this newer model without any further ado let's get started and check it out okay guys so i have my air pod right here so i can pair them to the airpod and then i have the clones right here so let me just show you what the box looks like all right so this corner right here it has a um that on it right there wondering how that happened but everything else looks really nice you have your earpods pro wireless charging case airpods logo right here you get some information it says the mwp22sh a airpods pro with charging case designed by apple made in california as well just so you guys don't know but i want to see if we're going to get any of the transparency features with this model because um that's why i have my airpod pro here so we could test out some of the functions with it so seeing but okay so they put some packets in here to make it look real make it look official pro all the paperwork um airpods apples pro [Music] and then you can see right here this is in another language flipping it over it's still in another language but you can see pressing pause to play skip forward uh triple press to skip back um press and hold for it looks like that transparency mode your tip remover as well inside of here okay you get your um apple uh the type what is this called lightning cable you also do get something in here oh extra ear tips inside of here one two three and four so here we go we're going to test out the wireless charging yup there is charging it has the yellow or the orange light right there you can clearly see it so that's clearly charging right there that's actually pretty sick so you get the wireless charger you get the logos on it a nice bright orange light when it's charging i want to test these out in my ear so make sure you stay locked in but i'm going to take this out the case so you can just see what that looks like okay so we get some serial numbers on the bottom you get the white thing on the bottom as well so these are pretty accurate looking you get your um is this a sticker i feel like that's like and woven in there it's not coming off or else it would have already i just tried to peel at it but that's actually a real real um mechanism there this is actually um that's not coming off either so that's not a sticker either so that's actually pretty sweet and um hey what's going on guys so this is the microphones coming straight from the airpods three clones they do look exactly one to one just like the airpods threes they were advertised that it was a one-to-one clone of the airpods pros these have that transparency feature and everything like that so but yeah guys these are the ipod airpod 3 clones these are really good you're getting noise cancellation and transparency modes which do work they do work when i turned on the noise cancellation mode the bass increased and the instruments got louder overall the whole earbud got uh it felt like it was just a lot more uh clarity and and base and tremble and then when i turned it off it you could hear the difference dramatically and then a a double like a just holding them for one second you'll hear the mode automatically transition to from transparency mode to um you know to the noise cancellation mode then you could turn it off from your device but i really like that it works so good with these it does really work there's no volume controls on these but you could switch the music perfectly fine and you could even use the siri function these i paid around 25 for so these are really really good i could highly recommend them they have um the right ear on them they also have the serial numbers inside um as you can see here i'm not sure if you can see that but they're there they're definitely there you also get this white cap on the bottom which resembles the air pods exactly i'm pressing something on them activating siri somehow but yeah these these things are really awesome guys uh you'll be able to use one but so far we're still using the microphone phones guys right now and i'm really enjoying these airpods three clones these were only 23 from when i paid for them they were advertised as one to one airpod three clones the sound is incredible it's really impressive i'm gonna give away the i um 200 thousands and the tws pros um for anybody who watch this video to the end so leave hashtag it uh leave hashtag tws pro or i 200 thousands in the comments down below and the first five people will be entered automatically the first five comments that i see those five people will be entered but i'm going to be giving away these clone models and um these work great the wireless charging works in these as well the only thing is that these don't offer the transparency modes that work they do have them but they just don't work but one of them have volume controls the other doesn't so there's going to be some differences with all three of these things all three of the airpod clones these are the best ones that i just reviewed it has all the logos and new and improved stickers and stuff but like i said if wait what just happened can you guys still hear me i just heard something inside of here yeah so i'm gonna do a background test right now and let me know if you can hear me we're actually listening to the mics right now i'm gonna put on some background noise so you can hear some ambience other than my voice and i'll actually move back just a little bit right back here so you could let me know if that might sound any different from when i was close to the phone versus away from it and i have the noise all the way up right now so that's all the way up as you can see let me know if it gets a little bit louder or if it gets a little bit if it's the same but let me know how that might sound the airpods three clones this is the sound quality that you would get now i'm gonna turn it all the way back down okay so let me know if you can hear any difference from when it was all the way up versus all the way back down but this is the earpods three clone mic test so let me know how this came out guys and i definitely think these sound really good when it comes to music but i need you to tell me how the microphones sound but in the meantime thank you for watching if you wear serrano and i would definitely say that these are worth the money the airpods 3 clones because they sound really good and they have all the functioning modes as well transparency active noise cancellation and wireless charging as well and they sound really good but we're talking with the mics right now but that's about it for this video like i said if you're new to the crew subscribe and get notified for all future videos stop playing with me we're trying to get to 12k by the end of this month but i'll see you guys later [Music] peace [Music] you", "HY87WhmGJ8g": "maybe you do it did what I did and accidentally goofed up your wiring for your ceiling fan light or maybe you are just interested in the story of how to fix something when you don't know how to fix it in any case this was my big mistake for the week and I'm going to show you how to wire up the remote controls to a ceiling fan when you have a four-way switch which is three switches in three different locations which are also hooked up to the fourth item which is the light source so the problem was originally that I had this bad switch and I had one of these and any time I would press the turn on light button the light wouldn't turn on and wouldn't turn on at 1 turned on so I decided to open it up when we were doing some remodeling and try to fix the wiring and it always bothered me a bit that the wiring wasn't quite right and there's three switches there's one of the top the stair one at the landing and one at the bottom the stair and as it happens with probably many people who try to do wiring in their house it didn't work and I ended up not only burning out the one at the bottom of the stairs but also the one at the landing and then this one it's not the stair so none of us which has worked and eventually through trial and error I ended up having just a mass of wires coming out of each and every outlet so let's take a look and see what we've got now so here's the switch where I started having the problem this was the switch that was in there and it was controlling the light and the fan speed on the ceiling fan originally this had been wired just as it for a chandelier it just had toggle switches here at the landing and downstairs this is at the top of the stairs and somehow somebody managed to wire these in correctly it was all working just fine these switches they will turn off the light if you switch them over and the reason for that is kind of interesting these are actually just radio transmitters and so power comes in through one of the leads and it comes out the other lead I mean it's alternating current but you think of it that way and so the black leads have the power running through them then there's a ground the ground goes up the copper well this box was the most confusing one because it has so many wires and if you look there are let's see one two three blacks three whites and three coppers there there's a black a white in the copper going up there's a black white copper going down and there's another black white copper going down on this side so through experimentation I eventually figured out that one of these wires was the live wire and it when you are doing trying to figure stuff out a home I would suggest that you get some of this colored tape and that way you can label stuff and so I immediately labeled this as my red wire and after some trial and error remember none of these wires were attached to each other I decided that okay if I attach this red wire which was coming from the bottom to this red this black wire that was going up and then I attached a couple of the white wires the same two white wires coming out of the same then I could get the light to turn out well that was good but I still couldn't figure out how to get the other switches to work I could wire one of these remotes in between the white and the black actually not between the white and black but like taking off one of these and putting the the switch right on the line in between and I'll grab one of these burnt-out ones to kind of show you the idea so you just kind of wear it in between here and it worked but how to get the other two to work so I called an electrician the electrician looked at it he couldn't figure it out my family members couldn't figure it out I called a friend over he couldn't figure it out but what he did bring was a multimeter and on the multimeter he switched the multimeter to ohms and then he proceeded to take a black and a white that were coming up in the same line twist them together and then we tried to see by testing the two wires whether or not the ohmmeter would move up or not and the whole meter did move up when we did the wires were just right but even when we kept working on that we couldn't quite figure it out until this morning and here's finally what I managed to do you'll notice that I have a couple wires they have green on them well I determined that these two wires go straight down to the bottom switch and then in that switch there's two more wires and they go up to the middle switch and I labeled those with yellow and then in the middle switch there's two additional wires one which is hot and those aren't supposed to attach to anything so that was confusing and so here here's how it's wired up the power is coming up you can imagine this as the hot line the red line then it goes up to the ceiling fan it comes down this white line it goes into the black line that goes into the switch it goes across the switch or the remote control and it comes to the green line the green black line so let's go downstairs and see where it goes from there so here we are downstairs the green black line is coming in and then that's attached to one of the leads on the remote control the power comes out you could say it's alternating current so I don't know if you would actually say that and then instead of sending it back up the white green to the top box we send it to the handing through the yellow and I send it through the yellow white I don't remember exactly why but that's the where it's going through so let's go up to the landing and see where it's at now so here we are at the landing and it was the white yellow that the electricity is coming up on connect that to one of the leads for the switch and then the other black line goes back to the yellow but to the black yellow which goes back to the bottom of the stairs so let's go back down there again here we are back at the bottom the stairs it was the black yellow which was coming down the stairs so that's this one right here and to get it to the top of the stair we ran it up the white green so now let's go back to the top of the stair and see what happened there so the white green comes up right here and then the power goes down the white lead which is paired with the the live wire right here the red black so I could have labeled this with our little red piece of tape but basically so we have the four-way if the power goes up to the light it comes down to the first switch it goes down to the second switch it goes over to the third switch and then it comes back down to the bottom box back to this box and then back down the wall so it took a few steps now if you were installing this sort of remote I was able to buy the replace from remotes on eBay not eBay on Amazon and the replacement remote looks pretty much identical to the original except the original set Emerson and it started to discolor the plastic but it had exactly the same buttons on the side here in order to make the remote work properly you have to make the switches match so this one has just the first one in opposition and the other three in the down position when you get these they'll all start in the position so you just use like a screwdriver and you can use the screwdriver just to push them up or down notice also on these that it requires or asks you to wire the middle wire the green wire to your ground and so in all three boxes the copper ground is wired in as well so another thing about these if you're going to put these in your house is you have to make sure that the current is has a circuit all the way through all the sources remember when you turn the light off and you turn the fan off you're actually turning off the power up yonder although it must still be going through because you still can turn the light on so there still must be power available in the switches I'm going to turn the fan on high you can hear it a little bit done medium but if you turn these any of these switches off then the circuit is not complete none of the remotes will work including if you have a handheld remote which I happen to get because I was already buying these for thirty dollars each I got one of the handheld remotes for twenty dollars and I supposed maybe we could buy more of those so that was my big mistake for the week it costs at least a hundred dollars and it cost a lot of time and an electrician coming out and saying that he couldn't fix it and all I really need to do is to go on to youtube and search how to fix one of those switches because you actually can open up the switch where the green button is you can clean behind the green button with some pencil and then it works again and if I had known that I could have saved a lot of time and energy but for you perhaps the usefulness of this video is knowing that if you do have a four-way switch us a four-way system where you have a light and three switches you can wire in those little remotes and what's helpful is number one which I should have done is to take a picture of each box as soon as you open the box and you have the wiring out take a picture maybe take two or three pictures the electrician when he came here even asked to see the pictures so take a picture in the box number two with those little remotes don't try to complete the circuit through the remote without having something on the line like like the light bulb to provide resistance because that's too much current and you'll burn out the remotes which is what I ended up doing with three of them number two find or get yourself a multimeter I actually had one of these in hidden way downstairs somewhere but when my buddy brought his over I was like oh that probably would have been really helpful and the whole idea on these is when you set them to ohm well when you touch the two leads together as long as the battery on the inside is working it's gonna go up a little bit okay so as long as you make most of a loop so if you connect black and the white at the top and then the black and white are open on the bottom you can touch the two wires to there and see that it completes the circuit and so I was able to figure out that there's the one wire going up and down and there's the other wire going this way from the landing to the downstairs and that was how I figured out well but if we run the electricity in this direction and then back but it's gonna work so get yourself one of these and then label the wires so I had this tape already but I believe I got this also on an Internet Amazon or somewhere and label the wires so that you know what's going where probably be what would be helpful to have diagram but number one take pictures when you open boxes number two get yourself a multimeter so you can make sure where the wires are going and number three get yourself some tape and hopefully the next big mistake you make won't the next this big mistake that I made

since I got in contact with y'all had a situation pop up once again at work this time I wasn't able to fix it at the job I actually had to come home and fix it pretty much what it was is every time I try to vape out of my little cartridge right here this just light would blink and it also happened to another one of my cartridges like this and this baby was brand new I was I was going crazy I've paid some good money for these cartridges so pretty much it was blinking it wasn't hitting I wasn't getting a pull from it nothing nothing nothing from this thing so pretty much what I figured out was all these things are just positive and negative heat coils going through that's all it is all these little vaporizers that's all they are so when it started blinking like that I was wondering if the wire from the inside was making contact with a negative or if the wire on the inside snapped let me try to show you what I mean all right so this is actually in the bottom of this one see if I could get this off with one hand and also at the bottom of this one you will have this little pin with the washer and a wire tucked in between it well if hopefully y'all guys can see that but my wire was snapped completely snapped off so what I did was I grabbed an old cartridge pulled off the rubber and ripped out as much wire as I could what I did after that was I took that wire with my tweezers wrapped it around the tweezers about twice to make kind of like a a ball of wire with a lead coming out of it I stuck the ball of wire directly down in there stuck the lead back through or straight up put the rubber piece around it because that's not supposed to make contact with anything on the inside if you understand that it's only supposed to make contact with the positive little pin or nipple whatever you guys want to call this thing so the wire goes in between the rubber and the metal once you get that going on the inside just make sure that there's a wire going across sometimes you got lucky if not the ball will hit the wrapping coils because all it is it's just a wire snapped so you're just making another connection with that wire so that it connects what you're positive you're negative everything's good you're able to hit and a vape again hopefully this helps some of you guys out I didn't really see an explanation like this out there but I'm able to hit my vape able to hit this bad boy yeah", "JH-fFfAWldc": "hmm okay this one should be interesting the air pods or the air paws pros which one should you get hey what's up guys soldier knows best there so I'm gonna keep this video nice and quick in town and dirty and let you know which one of these I think may be the best fit for you so let's start with the number one being at least in my book and that's going to be the price so the air pods pros with their wireless charging case cost two hundred and forty nine dollars and the air pods with a wireless charging case cost one hundred and ninety nine dollars and then the air pass without a wireless charging case cost one hundred and fifty nine dollars now all three of these cases can charge the air pods when you put them back in it and Apple says you can get around twenty four hours of use out of all three of these versions no matter which one is wireless or not and so at the end of this video if you're still kind of leaning towards the air pods and you don't really care about wireless charging I think your decision is gonna be pretty easy and that's gonna help you save some money going with the person that doesn't have the wireless charging case now let's talk about battery life so both the air pods and the air pause pros can get you around five hours of use but the air Potts pros can only reach five hours if you turn active noise cancellation off but if you leave it on you should be around four and a half hours we're still isn't that bad and so those times that I just gave you a four listening time so when you listening to your music or your movies but if you want to talk about talktime the air pots can get you around three hours and the air pods pros can get you around three and a half hours so you're really kind of looking at a difference of 30 minutes when it comes to both listening and talk times but if you want the absolute longest times you want to go with the air pass pros now let's talk about design real quick so you can tell that the air pause pros are going to be shorter and also just a little bit fatter but they feel great in your ear and the fact that they are short they don't have that long stem like you find on the air pause means that if you are gonna be taking your shirt off like Jonathan Morrison here is doing they're less likely to get hung up on your shirt and fall off and that has happened to me so many times but the main difference with the design is that the air pods pros have customizable tips so in the box you get three different pairs of tips small medium and large and you can just pull one off and then push one back on and now this will allow for you to get a better fit depending on your ear size now me personally I haven't had any issues with the air pods as far as being comfortable actually when I put them in my ear I don't feel them at but with these air paws pros they are comfortable but because the ear tips is in your ear and they're kind of making a seal leave you filled them a little bit more than you do with the air pots alright so now let's talk about sound quality and this is gonna be really easy the air paws pros sound better and that's because Apple has reengineering the internals and with all the different chipsets and stuff like that to make the sound better and also does have an adaptive EQ so that means it's gonna be kind of adjusting to your ears into a lot of different things that variables to make sure the music sounds the best and also with that active noise cancellation because it is blocking that unwanted noise from your background when you have a NC on you just hear your music you just hear your movies so you can hear all the details and the sounds but with that being said the air files don't sound bad either I never had an issue with the sound quality on the air pots and maybe that's just me because I'm just using these for working out and just walking around I think they sound just fine but another reason why these airports Pro sound better is because they do have these customizable tips so when you put them in your ear it make a really nice seal in your ear that keeps the sound from leaking out and also keeps the sound from getting in but at the same time though I do like the way the air pies feel in my ear because they don't create that seal when I'm walking around I can still hear my environment I can still hear the cars on the street I can still hear somebody walking up behind me and I don't have to take these out in order to talk to someone but with these airports pros because you had that really nice tight seal you either have to take these out to talk to someone or you can enter the new transparency mode now the transparency mode basically uses the microphones to be able to let noise in and while it does sound great is one of the best transparency mode I've used on kind of headphones like this it still doesn't sound as natural as the air pods because the air pies aren't doing anything they're just sitting in your ear it doesn't need to process anything so if you like kind of being aware of your surroundings I kind of like the air pods for that and then when it comes to controlling these two the controls are better on the air pods pros because they do have a force sensor and this new thing allows you to not only double tap like you can on the regular air pods but you can also triple tap as well so you can control all the different playback controls and also answer your phone calls and things like that but they'll happen to choose one or two like you have to do in the settings within regular air pods on these airports pros you have all those controls ready to go and then the force sensor can also be squeezed to be able to switch between the active noise cancellation mode and also the transparency mode and the last notable difference between these two is that the air pods pros are rated ipx4 so that means they can survive splashes of water and sweat for like ten minutes but I think they'll be just fine just like this now I actually did this through the air pods too and that is cold and maybe I should have waited to do that but from my personal experience not Beck's identity put these air pods into the washing machine at ASIS if I have like two or three times and I even put them in the dryer once and it came out fine so I mean if you just want that peace of mind the air pops pearls are definitely gonna be made for that but I think both will be great against water and sweat okay just have to rehydrate there for a second actually use the water the right way but yeah those are the major differences between these two now they both can do some other things like hey Siri commands and they both have that h1 chip inside of them so it makes it very easy to pair with your iOS device and I really think it comes down to one thing if you're trying to decide between these two and that is do you need active noise cancellation because if you don't and you're just fine with the air parts the way they sound and you don't really care about blocking out a lot of background noise maybe you just using these to run outside or walk around you still want to kind of hear your environment the irregular air pods are a great choice for you but if you are someone like me that travels a lot and I find myself on planes a lot of the time I don't like to use headphones without active noise cancellation on the plane these air pause pros can come in handy because I haven't used them on a plane just yet but I can assume that they'll be just fine I think that they'll be able to block out enough of that noise with the plane and people talking or whatever so I can still listen to my music or watch a movie and mostly peace so I think these come in handy so this prevents me from having to bring another pair of headphones in certain situations but now the choice is up to you so leave your comment down below and let me know which one of these that you would go with and also make sure you do subscribe to this channel and hit that notification bell but like always I do want to thank you for watching this video and I will catch you later peace [Music]", "2d3cqW0Chxg": "hi I'm Tim this is the era Pro Koch's this is our newest cartridge that we picked up I really have been liking them a lot lately they have their own battery so if you do have a different battery you got to get the battery or the nice thing is will better price than the others and then they hit really well when you do take a hit it vibrates which is kind of different it's kind of nice and this one is the mystical melody raspberry lime and tangerine it tastes really good so that one's my favorite come check them out", "1q5UYKMNsg4": "airpot SPRO are now out and they're honestly the best pair of wireless earphones you can get in terms of the overall package and how well they work inside the Apple ecosystem but what if you're an Android user well they still work in sound great if you've got something like the Galaxy Note 10.1 ality is a bit limited more on that in just a minute but let's first go through how to pair the air pods Pro to your Android smartphone as well as which features work great for Android users first make sure your airports pro are in the case then go into the Bluetooth settings and press and hold the button on the back of the air pods case to enter pairing mode keep holding the button and then tap on the air pods Pro when they show up in the available devices menu and you're done one of the best things about ear pods Pro regardless of which phone you use it with is the fit feel and comfort they fit great because they come with three different sizes of supersoft silicone ear tips and the best part is that the speaker grille itself is actually flush with the pod so only the soft ear tips go into your ears unlike basically all other inner ear phones that have a hard plastic tube that goes into your ear canal but it doesn't stop there the air boss pro have a venting feature that automatically equalizes the pressure inside of your ears to match the outside world so your ears will never feel plugged which is the worst thing about earphones that seal these two things make the air pods Pro the most comfortable in ear earphone since basically ever and it's the best reason you should actually buy them if you're an Android user most Android users will probably love the new short stem design compared to the old ear pods so the look and feel great and yes the noise cancellation features work perfectly well on Android devices just like they do with iPhones and same with all the force sensing controls including pausing and playing skipping tracks and cycling between noise cancellation and transparency modes these controls work flawlessly on the note 10 plus noise cancellation is seriously amazing and it works well enough to make this feature alone worth upgrading from air pods to but the transparency mode is actually the most impressive part and it works great with Android phones as well it basically uses a microphone to record your surroundings and then speakers play it directly into your ears so instead of everything sounded muted like you have earplugs in it sounds like you have literally nothing blocking your ears and one thing that people love about ear pods is the excellent microphone quality during calls and yes it's great on Android phones as well it's also pretty awesome that Apple included a lightning to USB C cable in the box and since most Android phones come with USB C chargers you're pretty much set and of course the air pods pro case also supports qi wireless charging so you can avoid using the lightning cable altogether the case is also pretty small and more portable than a lot of other earphones which is one of my favorite things about airports now getting into sound quality B sound absolutely amazing the best way to explain it is that the air Potts pro are more than loud enough while producing some of the most accurate sound quality out there there are some competing ear phones like the galaxy buds echo buds and power beats Pro that produced louder bass but the air paws Pro beat all of them hands-down and overall sound quality in accuracy the air pod pros are also the best overall package out of all of these earphones combining everything from ipx4 water resistance active noise cancellation incredible comfort great battery life awesome portability and more well each of those other options lack at least one or two things that the air pause pro have now let's go through the features that you miss out on if you use air pods pro on an android smartphone the hey Siri feature obviously won't work to activate Google assistant so you'll have to use your phone which honestly isn't a big deal on iOS you can customize controls so you can press and hold to access Siri on one side and use noise controls on the other on Android both sides will default to cycling between noise controls which in my opinion is perfectly fine for most people of course you also don't have access to the Apple ecosystem which instantly sets up air pods on the rest of your Apple devices that are logged into the same iCloud account for Android users that doesn't even matter at all on iPhone it's very simple to check your battery life by simply opening up the case next to your iPhone now that actually are some apps you can download on Android to check battery life but they don't work nearly as well as apples in limitation and finally there's automatic ear detection on iOS which automatically pauses your music when you take an air pot out of your ear and plays it again when you put it back in this is a pretty great feature that unfortunately doesn't work on Android but now that you can easily pause music with a single press on the stem it's actually quicker than taking your air pod out of your ear and even better the new transparency mode makes it so that you can hear your surroundings and actually have a conversation with someone while wearing the air pods Pro as long as your volume isn't set too high and a major plus is that you can take one ear pod out of your ear and put it into the case to charge and your music will continue to play in the other ear and when you take the airport back out of the case and put it into your ear it'll automatically play a couple of seconds later which is honestly one of my favorite ear pod features so in my opinion the ear pods on Android experience has never been as good as it is on the air pods Pro the many positives easily outweigh the smallest of negatives so in reality I would greatly recommend the air pods Pro to everyone including Android users if this video helped you out you can use

guys are smoking along hope you guys have spoken something dank and shooters let's get it [Applause] Choji shoutout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video that's true over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state I don't show you my personal information I hide yo what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so I got another card review uh I got into the car review for you guys in this video I've been doing a lot of these recently so time we don't blow in the comments if you guys been liking them I know you think you guys have but if you guys just like haven't and you guys just haven't haven't been telling me for whatever reason that went down below in the comments but I also want to get out more videos besides just car reviews I'm obviously I'm going to keep on doing reactions for a little bit and then I also want to get out like weeds rain video is just more like metal Ameri wanna related videos or not I mean but besides from that like other types of videos to so I have a few ideas but besides for my ideas if you have any suggestions leave them in the comments please for me I recently did a view a review on this like the lead I recently did a review on this a great white shark select elite heart and this was [ __ ] a low-key far as [ __ ] so know that [ __ ] was high key fires [ __ ] but um like I said I don't know if you guys watch that video you would see I got two more of them if you didn't know now you know I got two more of those so yeah hi guys so what strawberry cheesecake and real igloo number four so this video [Music] take the tiger yeah how it goes but we'll go with this one so we do strawberry cheesecake in this one if you guys want to see a video on gorilla glue number four leave it in the comments and I'll hit that oh I have a couple reviews on this brand already this brand is stupid fire they're a little pricey going in selling at 70 bucks for a full gram part but I don't pay that price I won't eat I only really buy these parts when I have deals going around like they have like a buy one get one free all the time or in this in this case I had a 3-1 gram cards for like a hundred and thirty dollars I think it was something around there but I don't we buy them unless they have with you like that going on so yeah seventy bucks for card is a little bit steep you know what I'm saying but strawberry cheesecake indica yes I don't know this just sounds fire selectively premium paid cartridges strawberry cheesecake indica sounds stupid fire I love indicas like I prefer indicas over hybrids or sativas the THC basically 90% it's or eighty nine point two about eighty nine point two CV 0% select elite you know what I mean I think that logo is pretty dope to just that little circle with the s you know you see something that's also really dope that I like about this brand is they have a selected serving so it's in their ideas how long should hit the pen for and if you hit it for that long supposedly with this one gram card you should be able to hit it about 250 times if you are it says like one three-second draw and close cartridge contains 250 servings and then each serving contains about late about like three and a half know it grams of THD you know what I mean so that's pretty dope I don't know it's just interesting to know pretty cool beyond I mean small detail and it just says the Arizona Department of Health warning right there and that's pretty much the package except for the back of it on the back of these is like what I really love about the carts the most it gives you all this like really cool detail yeah details you guys want you can pause that read it real quick and walk and I'll leave it up for too long but it says um the taste Oh sounds [ __ ] [ __ ] you know it's supposed to taste like strawberries flowery and sweet that sounds far as [ __ ] and as I supposed to make you feel relaxed happy and hungry so that sounds like my kinda card you know what I mean so no if you see right here like I was saying um it says you get like what almost 4 milligrams per serving and then right there this is the 3 second serving thing I don't know I just like how it says how it's supposed to taste and how it's supposed to make you feel okay it's pretty accurate in my opinion like I'm my pastor views my daughter is pretty accurate to the great white when I did the review on this one I thought this one was like pretty a cruise on the taste and everything too product is made on 3:13 2019 tested by c4 laboratories and it was tested on 2 7 2019 so yeah besides for that here's the card one more time for you guys that package and I mean pretty bill package in the show went over the whole packaging pretty much I feel like so um well I mean besides from the top it says no added chemicals blah blah blah on the bottom it says um the test results one more time yeah so now I feel like I went over the whole packaging so um let's open this up because with this tab right here and it opens up and then it says I'll select elite elevates your medical marijuana and drove me to a higher level with a luxurious Terry P nephews the car cartridge is top-shelf cartridge packs a powerful punch with our highest level of activated in it let her go marijuana THC and then you're supposed to pair with a select battery but unfortunately I don't have a select battery I'm gonna be smoking this off with my sky battery it's a pretty thick battery though I mean you can change the wash down here oh no it's pretty dope it's grape juice tea uh back into this if you guys want that's the website I guess you can go check out some more details and information on the website yeah there's that and then it just happens to the car so oh I forgot to mention in my last video but I love their mouthpieces to what they're just so comfortable to hit and I don't know so you open it up you're greeted with this select elite here's the card just take it out let me show you this some great white shark real quick I know this is a this great white shark it's a sativa so this is a sativa and this is the indica and I know like color really doesn't I mean it it matters to a certain extent but it's not the best way to justify if your cards are like high quality or not and I just want to show you guys this for like a little reference this might not be the best reference because this car isn't too dark but this is just the sativa one colors can like range from all different things like it can be the strain of the weed obviously in because Teva what they use to extra it's all like all sorts of things so it's the color it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad card you see this card is like super super light golden you know what I mean and it's super super clear so this is like a fire car this is a great white shark like I was saying and then that was it strawberry cheesecake this is a indica so it's a little bit darker but not too much darker but there I have seen some darker ones out there on the market I'm not like black market not I mean but like medical shops so the color isn't the worst but you see the clarity is still there that's really important is the clarity if it's like foggy smokey I wouldn't recommend smoking it and then also on the consistency every two they kinda that depends on how potent your cart your cart is it's like your car it says it's tested at like 80 90 % THD it should be like this not moving at all you know what I mean and if it's moving it's not tested at what it says it is if your package says it's tested at 40 percent or something like that and it's a little bit liquidy and it probably is like true you know no mean foe let me put it on the pen and I'll show you guys what it looks like on the pan and I guess what happened to smoke in it so sorry if I've been talking a little bit too much for ya let's just hop into it now on the pen here it is looking pretty dope I always love their carts I don't know I like a little logo to that like I said and now the pieces are always like super super comfortable like I don't know like a really comfortable to hit and I'm gonna start this off on a really low temperatures how are you like to two point three volts get a little flavor touchscreen first good taste that says I'm supposed to take taste little flowery but sweet and like strawberries so I'm kind of interested like the taste that [ __ ] that just sounds fire you know what I mean oh I hope you guys are smoking along if you guys are hope you guys are smoking something [ __ ] yeah that soil I'll give you guys I'll give you guys one more look at the oil real quick you guys hope you guys are smoking a lot and if you guys are let's get it alright so right off the bat I can taste a little bit of that Wow like the flowers that they're talking about it's weird I don't know how to really describe it is flowery flower we just flowery I guess I don't know how to describe it I can taste a little bit of the strawberries I don't we taste too much like nothing sweet let me go in for another here all right so I got it a little bit more tasted like this job Aryan sweetness on that taste um but the wax and the fact the wax taste is like super strike it strong and potent - so like you can taste the [ __ ] wax - obviously I'm the flavor Nick the taste I'm gonna give it if this is really hard though because like I don't know if you guys want me to read it by like what it says it's supposed to taste like or like because I want to give it a 4.5 just because it doesn't taste somewhere in between like a 4.5 out of 5 I'll give it to taste like a 4.8 out of 5 I know it's like a really weird score but I really can't decide like it tastes really good I've had way better tasting cards but those weren't as potent um but the flavor isn't as strong as it says it at least as I thought it would be like strawberry sweet that sounds fired but I don't really taste sniffing sweet as strawberry you know what I mean I mean I guess I can see like what they were kind of going forward like that when they say sweet it's not really sweet but I can see what they're going for what they what they were trying to say you know I mean but it's supposed to make you relaxed happy and hungry I'm not gonna lie I was I forgot that was it like a I was so let's make it for you and all I was thinking I was getting pretty hungry I was thinking I get in some food this year you know so that's definitely a working for sure I guess I'm feeling pretty happy and I'm definitely a little relaxed so I'll say that Stephanie work and I gets a 5 out of 5 nice can see that so the way it smokes it definitely gets a 5 out of 5 and white smokes let me turn this up because I've had these I already know because I've had these multiple times let me just make sure with this cars oh it's on we're gonna have fullest right now let me hit it a little couple back well it's for you guys and then I'll give you guys my final thoughts and opinions and ratings and then I'm gonna wrap this video up there so yeah again if you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken something bank and shooter so let's get it all right that was nice I wasn't too harsh then I hurt my lungs too bad um when we take a blinker here for you guys real quick I'll make sure you guys get button that one got me I'm pretty good now I'm not gonna [ __ ] lie so um overall score on this card have you seen my great great white shark review video I did like a the final score was like a four and a half out of five I think on this cart well I don't know I don't know I was gonna say I like to taste a little bit better but I don't know that other car it taste is pretty good too so I think I'm just gonna have to give this name score that I gave the other cards so just like a four and a half out of five super close to five really the only reason I wouldn't give it a five is just the price point you know I mean um this is really just cuz the price point because 70 bucks for a car like I could get two grams of wax for that race and uh Nemean and that will ask me a lot longer than this court will I really only by the stories for like video purposes or like a fact like go out and be discreet or something you know what I mean but I don't know cards are still cool yeah I mean um but yeah overall score I'll give the price point I'm like if I get to be out of five seventy bucks I don't know I forget an epic like quality cards or like really [ __ ] expensive to make you not I mean like if you're using some like quality like this lid or live president or whatever you're using to make the cart and you're actually right and if you're actually using some like quality tapes instead of like that keeps like cheap [ __ ] everyone's been using quality quality carts or I just like it'll be [ __ ] pricey so if you're getting them for like really cheap I really don't think the quality so I'm sorry you just always remember that quality called quality cards that cited tested i eighty-two like ninety percent are always gonna be like really thick and like they're not gonna like it this cart is like a little bit of hot now cuz I hit it [ __ ] so many times you not I mean but it's gonna be really thick it's not gonna move like that this is tested i 89% so if you get a card that the box says it's tested at 89% and it's not moving like this you know that shit's probably like not true I hope you guys over us forum I get to support my 5 out of 5 Daphne fire they were cheaper could be a 5 out of 5 but you guys want to see the review when a real number 4 card just let me know down below in the comments and if that's up anything else together one time we'd all in the comments like video ideas or it's anything anything just let me know in the comments I read like every single comment [ __ ] my Chester is lucky besides for that if you guys liked the video give it a

how to use this Dizzee premium vaporizer to start you're gonna grab your steady pot and remove the rubber stopper from the bottom then grab your battery and slide the pot right in the light flashing twice at the bottom will indicate this dizzy pot is properly inserted as long as you put the city pot right side up it will work as intended to activate this dizzy take an inhalation from the nozzle the light at the bottom illuminates signifying that it's working thus tizzy will auto shut off in about 10 seconds but that should be more than enough time to get a good dosage just exhale when you're done if the light at the bottom turns red that means it's time to charge your susie using the micro USB wire included with your vaporizer plug it into the charge port until the light turns white it takes about an hour to fully charge and you shouldn't leave it on the charger a couple of side note I'd like to use a rubber stopper as a cap for my sticky pot so when I store it nothing falls into the nozzle I also wish the pots themselves had a mark to know which was which and you can easily mix them up putting them together a little word of advice given to me by Rocket Man SF is that you can play with the carp caps located at the bottom of the novel for a much more concentrated hit that's gonna do it for this how to use dizzy video you guys thank you for watching make sure you comment

and they currently solve for around 89 dollars so a little bit more expensive than the regular eye 500 which is the air pod two clones that sells for around $50 right now of course the air pod pros were released not too long ago so these are fairly new they have a more conventional in year style design that should provide better noise isolation capturing a tighter seal and improved audio quality otherwise the real air pod pros also have that built in a feature of active noise cancellation however the clones at the moment is still lacking that feature but that being said all the other features are retained for example there's still an optical sensor which allows it to automatically play and pause the music whenever you remove them from your ears and when you pop them back in the music will resume just like the regular air pods and furthermore it also has a built-in wireless sheet so you can pop it onto a charging mat and it will wirelessly top-up just like the real pros and the air pod to is from before in terms of battery performance it's actually the same as the regular I 500s it will last for four hours of audio playback and then you get three extra charges with the battery case so you get around 15 to 20 hours of life when on the road again it's not an endurance champion the air pod pros are still about the same size overall as the regular air pods so we're not talking about a significantly larger battery case and then inside we have the eye 500 pros themselves we also have a lightning cable that you can use to charge up the battery case if you don't want to use wireless charging and taking a closer look at the design here it is exactly the same as the real air pod pros it even has again the aforementioned designed by Apple in California printed on the rear it's man of this glossy shiny polycarbonate plastic just like the originals and does feel quite sturdy there's an LED status light which will glow when the battery case is opened and whenever the door flips open it will automatically pair with your phone now inside we have the same kind of stamps as actual air pods that tells you the serial number information and again everything just feel very convincing and similar to the originals there's also a quick instruction manual inside of the box that tells you how to quickly pair it again with the h1 ship as long as you're within five centimeters will automatically connect and if you are using an Android device you can simply hold on the button on the rear here for a few seconds until the light here starts to flash after which points you can pair under Bluetooth settings the controls and commands are more or less replicated and you can simply tap on the stem very gently to play and pause of music if you don't want to use the optical sensor and you can also double tap to do things like can't skip tracks and also answer phone calls but just like the real air pods you don't have the ability to control the volume on these so if you want to turn it up or down you still have to rely on your phone's volume rocker alright so flipping things open we can take a closer look at the earbuds they're also magnetic so they can attach or the satisfying click again we are talking about so very small and compact battery case it's just a bit wider now and a little bit shorter again it's no surprise that even the ear buds look identical we have the same optical sensor that detects when you're actually wearing them when you remove them it will play and pause the music this is the area that you can tap on to control the play and pause and skip tracks there's also a site gentle on the sides here the same contact design for charging and the same kind of serial number printed even on the face it says Apple so very similar it does seem like with this packaging we don't have any replacement silicon tips that you can switch between at least in the packaging that we have here so this seems to be the only pair of silicon tips that we're seeing at the moment as a quick size comparison here they are next to regular air pod shoes you can see that the again battery case is still very much comparable and these are definitely some of the smallest designs on the market very easy to talk into a pocket for transportation purposes and if we compare the Yurbuds themselves again they are very similar in terms of overall dimensions these are a bit more snug fitting because of the rubber tip as opposed to a semi-open design which is a bit more transparent in terms of the sound as aforementioned we have the same pop-up notifications for easy pairing name of the earbuds are indeed called the ear pods Pro and it really is treated and recognized just like the real deal overall I'd say of the sound quality is definitely an improvement over the regular I 500s when it comes to giving you a more clean sound there's no hissing hung in the background or any distortion that you can notice like the air pods sometimes produces so even if you pause the track with the airport pros the i500 pros everything is completely silent otherwise they found the fit to also be a bit more tight and comfortable because of the added organ ah makes and the in your shape and as a result they do block how considerably more noise even passively like on here so if you are working in a slightly more busy environment and you don't want to hear what's going on around you this particular design is definitely more effective all these sensors work exactly as advertised you can very gently tap to register commands like playing and pausing your music the optical sensors are really good at detecting when they're actually in your ears and it does work pretty much 100% of the time that I tried it out earlier so it will automatically play and pause the music without any problems when it comes to sound profile there's a comfortable amount of bass especially if you're listening to EEM type music with drum beats it does get quite bumpy perhaps a tad less bass heavy than the regular air pod to's as well as the i500 originals these are slightly more I would say pronounced in terms of their mids but at the same time it still sounds very well balanced as a result and same thing with troubles it sounds quite clean so definitely one of the cleanest sounding kind of air pods and Airport clones that I've seen yet otherwise there's very little latency issues especially if you're just using them for watching YouTube videos and again connected using the iPhone because of the latest Bluetooth 5.0 chip that means you can watch videos and the audio and video for the most part are synced together quite well I would say that the latency difference might be less than a hundred milliseconds so unless you are watching a really demanding high frame rate action film it's not going to be too noticeable connectivity is also very stable so I never encountered issues where the left or right sides got how to sync with each other or disconnected with the phone overall charging process does work exactly as advertised so I can pop them back into the case here and then put it onto a Qi charging mat for example and we can see that it will begin kind of charging itself up if we kind of dim the lights here you can see it will fully charge up the case and around two hours or so so that's more or less it as far as our hands-on review of the eye 500 pros again these are currently the most convincing air pod pro clones on the market from a hardware perspective it's pretty much one-to-one as far as getting all the details exactly right the weight the feeling is also the same and we I would say you know 90% of the functions replicated as well from the wireless charging the h1 ship the optical sensor to the very sensitive capacitive button that you can use to play and pause and control things however the feature that you don't have right now is the active noise cancellation and the transparency modes those are probably going to take a little while before they come over to a clone just because they are still very new technologies but getting pretty close in terms of the sound quality and the design at least so if you like what you see here and again you want something a bit more tighter and more snug fitting then the IEEE 500 pros might be worth a closer look thanks for watching through our OS reviews that's been our hands-on look at the IEEE 500 pros air pod pro clones", "BD5mNTuCLIM": "[Music] hey guys this is chetan pakistan times and you're watching the unboxing of the real me parts air pro master edition there's nothing different from the real me purchaser pro if you talk about the specifications the features and everything and even with the pricing as well but what is different is the design so the master edition is a result of the collaboration between real me and jose levi uh the same designer who the company had partnered with for the real me but skew design as well as the dear me sld tv uh so this is not something new but really has been doing this from time to time they partner with some of the best designers to uh come up with newer designs so this is uh what they call as a full mirror finish and it's made with the vacuum plating process and what you see as the specifications of the features is the same you get active noise cancellation up to 35 decibels there's uh the 94 millisecond super low latency or the gaming mode and then you have the 10 millimeter base boost driver transparency mode as well and you have the 25 hours of total playback of the music and that is including the case and the earbuds together uh the mrp given here is 699 but of course you know the price and there are four year tips and that is given in the box and the earbuds work with the real milling app and the app actually has got a lot of updates in the recent times uh the usability and the experience has become much better with that now inside the box package firstly what you see are these things so of course you see uh the wholesale device code here and then that's it then you have the varying tips on how to wear the earbuds and also you have the touch commands the the touch points whichever are possible so you have that as well here and you have the user guide of the university pro now here's the main thing that's the realme but air pro master edition and a full mirror design as i said this is completely a mirror as you can see it's clearly what you are being told is what you are uh getting here uh so you have the real me as as well as the wholesale device collaboration logo given here but personally if you ask me i've been always addressing the same to the company as well and i've been telling that on my videos that i'm not a fan of anything that is glossy in these kind of things because if you see the fingerprint replacement and everything the smudges fingerprints easily fall onto this case but what the company has mentioned to us is that they have found out that people really don't care about glossy back or glossy designs or matte finish in the end what looks good to them is what they choose so this might be the case why they came up with this full mirror design and this is the case and once you lift this up that's when you feel that okay the earbuds at least are better in looks when compared to the case so this also has the same full mirror design and uh you would see let me lift these up first let me remove the stickers from here so if you take a closer look at the earbuds itself you see they also have the same mirror finish and uh it's not just on the earbud but also on the stem so everything is completely glossy and like a mirror and i'm not sure how long would they stay like this and would it get scratches not just the earbuds because earbuds won't usually get that scratched that easily unless you keep them out for a long time and the case is what worries me more because uh the case is where you would uh you might see scratching or everything that is uh like the smudges fingerprints it won't look good as good as what it is right now when you take it out of the box but then it also depends on how the user is using it obviously and uh otherwise if you see inside the case it's the same black plastic and uh to hold those earbuds and you have the usb type support towards the bottom nothing else is mentioned actually and that is what makes this a pretty good looking case but as i said it's completely a thing about personal opinions i don't personally like glossy bags but there are people who might actually love this kind of design so if you're someone who actually likes it you know the choice is not going to be that bad if you're going with the master edition and you have a yellow uh usb type-c cable that is given inside so uh really has tried to actually give different kind of things i mean that actually look cool and uh it actually appeals to the youth that's what i feel and we have the extra pair of ear tips as well and uh that's four ear tips in the end you have the large size that is already placed on the earbuds and then the other three sizes small medium and excel inside the box package so these are the ear buds and if we again give you a quick overview of the uh earbuds here you have the pinch towards the bottom for charging whenever you place them in the case uh you have the app control with the real milling application there's transparency mode uh so what transparency mode is that if you have the active noise cancellation turned on what the earbuds do is they reduce all the background noise but if you still want to listen to someone who's speaking just around you and they're trying to tell you something you can have the transparency mode turn on so every other noise is reduced but that particular person talking is not going to completely cancel out so you can at least listen to that with the transparency more and you have up to 35 decibels of noise cancellation with these real me birthday pro and you also have the ipx4 certification for the splash proofing off for the earbuds not the case remember that it's not for the case it's only for the earbuds and in terms of battery life there's about five hours of battery life with the active noise cancellation turned on and about 6 hours if you have the anc turned off so that's another difference and because anc actually takes up more battery uses more battery and without anc is what is 25 hours of battery life is claimed on the box so that's without a nc with nc it's about a total of 20 hours uh so you get about three charges on the case and the single charge on this 5s is 20 hours with active noise cancellation and there's about one hour of charging time for charging the case uh with the usb type-c and uh 10 minutes of charging of these earbuds would actually give you about three hours of playback so that's a good thing if you're someone who's just about to go out and you don't have a lot of charge in your earbuds you can charge them for 10 minutes and that's it you can then use them for three hours and there's also the weight detection sensor uh so here's the sensor given there on the earbud so in case you remove these from your ears they would automatically pause the music and that's a good feature that you see in this price range so these are the major features and this was the unboxing of the real way buds air master edition that comes with this full mirror design so it's kind of a different design it actually looks good but it's always about the personal opinions and favors i don't really like these kind of designs but there are people who would dig it they would love it so it depends it actually looks good but i'm not sure how good would uh it remain the same way that i have just taken it out so i'm not sure about that otherwise if it's uh sturdy enough if it doesn't take a lot of scratches then it surely would be a great choice so that's it guys this was the unboxing of for the real me but here pro master edition that's made with the collaboration between a host levi and real me so that's it guys i hope you liked this video if you do share and subscribe to ximena time for more thanks for watching see you next video", "9SXeCBNT_O4": "are you doing guys welcome back here we have the arctic air ultra the new product out on the market the new improved version of the arctic air supposedly two times the cooling power we're gonna test all this out we're gonna take a look at this product and see if it's an improvement over the old one if you haven't seen my original video on the original arctic air I'll leave a link up here to that one wasn't super impressed with it really I thought it was garbage product we're gonna see if this does anything better if it's worth you going out and pick it up so let's take a look at this you can see new look on it as far as you know the pictures on the side same there let's go ahead and break this open and see what's in here a little instruction card for best results instructions power cord and our arctic air ultra this plastic off here different look than the original so here's the original here's the new one it is a little shorter and not quite as wide either so smaller unit and the one thing I noticed right off the bat is this one had the light-up panel that did different colors you could cycle through those this one doesn't this just lights up on the top and it's just one color so it's you can have it either on or off so you don't have the different colors that this one had but this is supposed to have more powerful fan also you notice in the front here this one you can kind of just you know if you want to blow it down if you're not blowing up no adjustment on the old one so that's definitely approvement there let's get this out of here we know that was garbage so the new one let's take a look at these for best results so for best results pre-soak your filter place your filter under running water until wet tip for even more cooling place the wet filter in the freezer until frozen so that wasn't something that you did on the original one so here's your filter a different looking filter than the old one so for best result to say soak this under water and stick it in the freezer place a flat place on glass surface fill tank with water right here and it has a little knob a little tab in there that says max you fill up to that tab so we'll play some water in there point towards you and in just events to direct the flow recommended regular cleaning of your so you just stick this in the dishwasher SS and if you lose this card they have a sticker right here saying the exact same thing I got a lot of comments in that first one people were looking to buy this device because they didn't have AC or the AC was broken and thought this was gonna replace AC in your house this is not a mini air conditioner it's not gonna cool down your room even though bring up the box here even though on the box they show it and it says great for living rooms offices kitchens bathrooms basements and bedrooms and more cool your space fast and easy but if your look in those pictures everybody has the Arctic air right next to them so that's all this device is gonna do it's a personal space cooler it's gonna cool 2 to 3 feet out from this device so is it gonna cool your house down no maybe if you have 20 of these all over the place maybe but just to buy a couple of these if you think it's gonna cool the room down I don't think so I know the last one the old version didn't do it we're gonna test this one I'm gonna get it going check the temperature in here let it run for a little while and we'll see how much it does so let's get this filled up and ready to go and first I'm going to just do it just out of the box I'm not going to soak this I'm not going freeze it we're gonna check and see how cool the air is coming out of it just the way it is because that's gonna be the way you're gonna use it most of the time because say you have this in your office or something like that you're not gonna be running and soaking that filter or putting it in the freezer you're just gonna turn it on and have it go and see if it cools you know so that's why we're gonna test it first then we'll put some water in there you know put some water on that filter and freeze it so I got my tap water here cold tap water out of the faucet okay so I have the water filled up just where it just touches that machs tab and again filters not wet didn't freeze it turn that on and it's blowing pretty good fairly cool let's move it back from me a little ways let's put it back like say two feet if I'm working on computer I have it sitting over here I feel it's pretty cool let me set it at the very corner of the table let me move over here and I'll probably boat sitting back here prob about four feet away from it right now I can feel it from here I mean it's keeping me cool again I don't know if you can hear that let me pull it up here closer to my microphone I mean it's it's fairly loud I mean if you aren't working in like a cult quiet office or something or you have to work on the phone a lot the high speed maybe not medium still get it up here is fairly loud low it's not the quietest device but it's working it's it's keeping me cool so your if you if you want to use one of these devices don't have to deal with the noise but let's see how cool this actually is with just water coming closer to the outer edge of it about 69 so if I get it right in the middle again about what 64 63 64 so 63 to 64 and that's just I was aiming that right in the middle there let's get the old arctic air here going alright let's get it going again both on high again like I said the arctic air ultra a little louder turn that one off from that yeah definitely feel the new one more more of a breeze coming on you than the old one but let's check the temperatures coming out of this gun both go in here turn them around here and that's the thing when you have these you can't move them around too much because water just comes out of them really easily check that a new one of the ultra again about 63 to 64 right there in the middle let's go to the original and we're getting colder temps out of this one [Music] so check it again it's kind of fluctuating down to 1659 but the originals getting down to 55 coming out of there so to begin with just out of the box just just adding regular water out of it this one the fans blowing won't you feel it more on you but the temperatures coming out cooler on this one but again not a strong fan so unless you're rating front you're not gonna feel that but now let's do what they said in the instructions let's put some water on that filter then I'm gonna toss it in the freezer for about a half-hour and then we'll put it back in and see how much of a difference that makes completely wet they're like that's pretty good now let's go ahead and throw it in the freezer all right so I got it in the freezer now let it sit there for about a half-hour okay so it's been about 50 minutes this has been sitting in there you can see there's ice buildup on it so this is well frozen let's go ahead and stick it back in there make sure you get it in the right direction and of course there is ice on the bottom you have to scrape some of those ice chunks off in order for it to fit oh there we go get back in there all right so we have a filter that was random on the water stuck in the freezer had it in there for about 50 minutes all right so I'm getting that's about 43 so yeah it's some cool air coming out of it let's turn this off for a minute so the only issue I have with this now while it is really cold air coming out of there it's a process I mean I could see maybe running the filter underwater you know that's an easy thing to do if you're in an office or anything you just run it under there drinking or something to get it wet and stick it in there but are you gonna run and put it in a freezer and have to sit and wait and then how long is this gonna last being that cold you know eventually especially if you're in a warm room that filters gonna thaw and it's not gonna be frozen anymore so you're not gonna get that really cold air coming out of there so while it's putting out cool air right now I don't really see that being a viable option for you I mean how often are you gonna keep going and okay it's start to get a little warm I'm gonna run and stick that in the freezer again and wait now maybe if you had multiple filters so when this one starts to you know lose its coolness you switch the filter out but again that's more money you're spending and are you gonna go through that much you could and you'll get what was it about forty three degrees coming out of there so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna put the arctic air over here at the end of the table and have it and we're gonna check the temperature on the couch over here and I'm gonna let it run for like a half-hour and see if it changes the temperature over there just to kind of get an idea of how much space you're gonna try to cool down with us again this is a personal cooler you know it's not gonna cool a whole room down so within three to four feet I think it'll cool that space down but this is probably more like a six-foot space and to see if it does anything after running for a half an hour and then we'll check that temperature coming out of here too and see if it's warmed up any after about a half hour so is that forty three degrees and we'll check it again in a half hour of letant and just run let's see what the temperature is then so let's check and see what the temperature is over here on the couch right now with this off okay right now I have it shooting on the back of the couch and we're getting about sixty eight point five and well it runs for the half hour I'm gonna turn off the lights so we don't get any heating from these lights heating up the space either so let's check the temperature on the couch it's been a little over a half hour we're getting about 68 degrees on the back on the seat about sixty or eight degrees also sitting here the the arctic air is back behind the camera here it's probably six feet from me and I feel a pretty strong breeze I mean it's blowing it out fairly strong I mean can't really tell I mean but it's blowing I can feel it right here it's cool right here so it did drop the temperature a little bit right here so you don't have to sit right on top of it and I did check the temperature on the thermostat when I set this up it was 71 it's saying 70 now this is a really big space my ceilings are 16 feet high so it's not gonna cool this room down but I would see I'm over here if you're directly in front of it you're gonna feel the breeze I don't feel it right here I can't if I put my arm out here again it's what 70 degrees in here so it's not really hot in here but you're not gonna feel the breeze on you unless you're directly in front of it but I'm fairly impressed with it I mean like I said it's quite a ways away from me that other the older arctic air did have that stronger fan that it didn't blow this far of a distance but I will say it's loud when I had this running for the half hour I was down the hallway in the bedroom you know three rooms down I could hear it so if you're in a space where you need it to be quiet this isn't gonna work for you but if if you can hear this fan so that's not an issue with you I mean for a personal space cooler I'm fairly happy with this it's doing better than I say a fan you could have a fan you know turning and cooling multiple people down but for one person this is doing a good job now let's get that infrared thermometer and check the temperature coming out of there now that it's been a little over a half hour see if the temperatures still as cold as it was when we put that frozen a filter in there okay so now I have it shooting right into the middle what were we at about 44 43 44 I think before now we're up to 52 53 so there you go you can see that it's been a half hour that frozen filter we have in there and let's pull it out of here take a look yeah it's not frozen anymore it's it's still wet but that's the thing freezing it is gonna give you cooler temperatures but for just a short period of time because nothing that's gonna unfreeze and then you're not going to get those really cold temperatures so I think that's a step most people probably aren't going to do but it's been a half-hour at that filter is still really wet and that's probably gonna give you a little bit cooler temperatures doing that maybe so I don't think the whole freezin it's gonna be a really big game-changer for because I don't think many people are gonna do that again I like the distance that I don't have to I think that other one the old version that's around here somewhere I had to pretty much have right on me to really feel it this one six feet away when I was on the couch there I can still feel that breeze on me it's work and you can it you know adjust if you want to blowing up or down I like that smaller I think it's a better-looking unit than the other one same price now I know I got a lot of comments on the other video people saying you need to put that in the window that's why it's not working good this doesn't go in the window nowhere on a box the directions anywhere does it say this device goes in the window that's not what it's for so no you don't need to put it in the window and yes I know you can also put ice in here too to help cool it down but again I think that's just something you're not gonna waste your time with because it's the same as freezing that those ice cubes aren't gonna last that long it's gonna give you cooler temperatures just for a short period of time are you constantly gonna keep putting ice in there and I did a video on the other one where I compared just tap water to ice water to see how much of a difference you're gonna get I'll leave a link up there to that video if you want to check that one out and like I said in that video I mean how often are you gonna keep adding ice to it so I don't think you're gonna use that way I think you're probably most you are just gonna fill it with water you're not gonna put water on the on the filter either and we were getting what in the mid 50's so I think even just doing it that way it wasn't bad it blows quite a distance for a personal space cooler it's it's working I mean it's doing what it's saying it's not an AC it's not gonna cool your whole room down it's not gonna cool your house down so don't get it that's what you're looking for it just needs something to cool you down in a small area this will work so let's turn these lights out and because there is a light on top it like I said the old version had multiple colors the whole side lit up and you could get it could go through the different colors you could just have one solid color this just has one color on the top so let's turn everything off and take a look at that so there it is with it um it's a really dim blue so it's not as bright as it seems in the camera so there you go there's a look at the arctic air we checked the temperature on it I'd like the temperatures we're getting outta there we're getting some cooler temperatures you get some really cool temperatures if you do freeze that filter but again are you gonna go through that process all the time I doubt it it's a decent device for what it's supposed to do a personal space cooler don't think it's gonna cool your place down it's not gonna cool a whole room it's not gonna cool a house or an apartment down like I said when I was sitting on the couch there I could feel it on me if I was directly in front of it but if you're sitting to the sides you're not gonna feel it that much so guys let me know in the comments below do you have this version or the other version how's it working out for you do you like it you know overall I mean I don't love the product and I don't hate it I wish it was quieter it is really loud but

not what i meant by interesting it's more about the value these offer at a very nominal price the airpods pro mainly known for noise cancellation have a lot of noise cancelling rivals you know from the likes of sony and sennheiser now these also support active noise cancellation but they're just 5000 rupees and there is probably no rival in this price segment and that's what makes this product very interesting anyway i still wouldn't say these are a blind buy there are some quirks here and there which you need to know so stick with me till the end of this video and yeah as you can see this

earlier they look just like the airport pro in the iconic white color silicon tips and all that they're slightly larger in size but not noticeably heavier than the original buds air the inclusion of active moronic cancellation also means realme had to increase the battery capacity in the case which they did that's why the case is also larger it doesn't easily fit in the watch pocket anymore yes that tiny pocket in your denims is called the watch pocket back in the 20th century people used to put their pocket watches in them uh hit the thumbs up button if you didn't know about that so yeah overall noticeably larger but not heavier i also like the fact that real me has used a metal hinge here hopefully it offers better durability it's a neat little addition given that most if not all earbuds in this price segment are made of just plastic which is fine they're light on the ears now the best feature of these earbuds in my opinion personally is the addition of these silicone tips if you guys know me you know i don't really like ear buds without silicone buns you just cannot get any level of isolation with them even with music playing at 100 volume you hear external sounds and with buds even the audio quality feels perceivably better of course your experience might be different not all yours are perfectly compatible with all earbud designs but the probability of getting a good fit is higher with the bud type earbuds especially because they usually come with multiple pairs of ear tips in different sizes and one of them should be fine for you anyway these fit snug even without turning on noise cancellation you get an isolated feeling and since they just firmly sit there they can be used for all sorts of physical activities not all sorts of but the ones outside of your bedroom at least the the point is they don't fall off they are also splash resistant or sweat resistant they have an ipx5 rating all these are quite common in this price segment what really sets these apart is the active noise cancellation like i said earlier so there are three modes number one transparency mode which kind of amplifies the external sound basically useful when someone's talking to you you can hear them quite clearly without having to remove the earbuds number two normal mode which is just normal same as wearing any other pair of earbuds and number three noise cancellation which cancels out the ambient sounds as much as possible you can toggle between the three modes by doing a tap and hold on either side so yes they offer touch controls more about that later now i've been using some of sony's high-end noise cancelling headphones you know uh those that cost uh over 15 20 000 rupees so i have a pretty good idea of what good noise cancellation is and what isn't i've also tried xiaomi's wired noise cancelling earphones that cost around 3000 rupees and from what i can remember these are as good as them if not better you know in terms of noise cancellation if you play some music at about 50 volume it's perfect all the external sounds and are completely muted uh even without playing anything these earbuds do suppress most of the ambient noises to a good extent basically any sound in the same room like you know the ceiling fan running you'll still hear some of it obviously but the tv playing in the living room people talking in the adjacent bedroom or cooking sounds in the kitchen you know these are some common external noises and they get cancelled out pretty well but only if you wear them this way i don't know why but that's how the drivers are angled so this is the only way you get complete isolation which is fine it's just that you know it might look weird to some people uh in fact in the past one month a couple of my friends actually asked me why i was wearing them weirdly weirdly but yeah that's how they work best now the fit is perfect they don't fall off but these are not the most comfortable earbuds to wear again this may depend from person to person but in my experience these cause a bit of pain especially when you wear them continuously for over 40 or 45 minutes maybe anybody else using these can chip in just comment below to let people know how your experience has been also these are not the most comfortable sounding earbuds either at full volume the treble gets quite harsh treble as in you know songs that are heavy on vocals and other high pitched sounds are not very pleasing to hear but anything under 90 or 95 volume the quality is pretty good and even at 90 volume trust me the audio is quite loud you probably wouldn't want to push it all the way to 100 even if you do you can nullify that emphasis on treble by enabling bass boost plus on the real me link app yep that works guys the short version is the audio quality is not bad at all for the price and yeah about the real me link app in case you were wondering it's the official app that you can pair with real me smart devices it offers plenty of customization options remember i said these offer touch controls just like the original real me buds air well they are customizable as well the default settings did not have any trigger for voice assistant or skipping to the previous track so i had to manually set them here there is a dedicated gaming mode which significantly reduces the input lag or latency without this the latency is very noticeable not just while playing games but while watching videos as well so i preferred to have the gaming mode enabled the whole time except while listening to music but this app is not available on ios which is surely a bummer but not really a deal breaker in my opinion you can temporarily connect these to an android phone just to customize these touch controls and then you can connect them back to your iphone well i haven't tried it but it should work technically anyway most of the nice features from the original real me buds air have been retained like you can just tap and hold on both sides to enable or disable the gaming mode you can remove one or both earbuds to pause whatever is playing uh make sense right also pairing these with your phone is extremely easy thanks to the support for google's fast pair technology it's just as seamless as pairing apple's airpods with an iphone which is a big deal speaking of big deal truly wireless earbuds have always struggled in one specific area phone calls but thanks to the two dedicated microphones for noise cancellation on each year but the buzz air pro do a fantastic job and i think the beard position also helps i guess uh anyway this is obviously being recorded via the airport microphone let me know in the comment section how the quality is uh as you can see it's quite uh noisy out here uh i'm just near the road and you know there are a lot of vehicles passing through quite nicely right right here like i said so i guess uh this is a great situation to you know test the audio quality and let me know how you liked it of course it's gonna sound inferior to this audio which is being recorded by a much more expensive microphone so yeah these can do the job quite well now of course with all these upgrades realme also had to increase the battery capacity with noise cancellation on these last as long as the original real me buzz air did and that's about three hours on a single charge with noise cancellation on at 1995 volume with noise cancellation disabled they last another 45 minutes or so and of course the case has enough juice to charge the earbuds four times that's a total of 15 hours or 18 hours with noise cancellation off real means claims have much higher numbers but remember those were tested at about 50 volume uh the earbuds also support fast charging a 10 minute charge will get you around 2 hours of continuous playback again at about 50 volume so overall these are definitely in a league of their own like it's kind of an all-rounder and nothing comes even close mostly due to the fact that these offer good noise cancellation which is pretty much non-existent in this price segment also the level of customization they offer the app support a firmware update support you know these are usually limited to high-end truly wireless earbuds like the samsung butts plus or the sennheiser momentum to see all that stuff packed inside a relatively inexpensive model is great however i do suggest trying them out first and seeing if your ears feel comfortable for long listening sessions i personally didn't find them very comfortable could be different for you so yeah these are apple airpods pro knockoffs or clones just with a lot better value for your money there you go thanks for watching ashwin sundar here from technology jock see you in the next one bye [Music] you",

"EiIiI4037NE": "hello everybody I'm Terri Peterman the internet electrician and welcome to another one of our video shorts on current topics here at electrical - online.com today we're going to cover the installation of a ceiling fan and while we've done many ceiling fans on the website this particular one has a remote control device with it so we're going to gloss a little bit over the assembly of the fan because that's not much different than any of the other ceiling fans we've covered and we're going to focus mainly on the connection of that remote control receiver and the device that comes with it operate that back so let's unpack the box it's a Hampton Beach charity model 56 inch ceiling fan let's get started so we've unpacked all the contents of the box and ensured that we've got all the parts here as for the parts list that they provide the manual starts off talking about the safety rules which of course mostly involved making sure the power is off before you work on an electrical circuit all our parts are in place it talks about making sure that the box that you're going to mount this fan to is securely fastened well this is a new construction home and the Box installed for this ceiling fan was designed to hang a ceiling fan from so we've measured ourselves of that now we're going to start with ending the main body of the fan and that's when we get into the electrical connections that we'll talk about in depth here as to how to look up this remote control device okay I've got my bracket installed for the ceiling fan oh this holds the downrod got my wires all out and ready to make my connections to the remote receiver it gets installed up here in the canopy of the fan first though we have to determine as I mentioned this is a new installation and this was all wired pre-wired with thought of a ceiling fan being mounted at this location in mind so we've got a white wire a neutral common ground of course we've got a red wire and a black wire now typically when you're doing a ceiling fan that has separate control for the fan and the light kit you would have your common white or your neutral and then you usually hook up the ceiling fan to the black wire and then the light kit to the red wire which is usually the blue wire inside the ceiling fan assembly well with the remote control all you really need is a source of power up at the fan so what we have to do is determine which switch operates the yellow the red wire which switch controls the black wire over on the wall and then decide what is going to be your basically your master switch to turn this fan and light assembly on and one of the switches won't be used in this case so what we're gonna do is find out on the wall over here which one that the homeowner would most likely want to have as controlling the fan the master control and then which switch is not going to do anything so we'll determine that and then we'll make our connections here and the unused wire the red of the black will just get tucked up into the box so this is the receiver for the remote control for the family now as you can see it's a little tricky to get all this stuff stuffed up inside the canopy of the fan but it can be done because that's how it's designed now we've determined that the wall switch that we want to use controls the black wire and so between the black and the white that's going to be your power source to power up the remote control so we're going to cut off the red wire just trim it put a cap on it tuck it up into the box we're going to connect our neutral to the white on this remote control power in and we're going to connect the black to the black from the power into the remote then the wires coming out of the ceiling fan and light kit assembly are here they get connected to this side of the receiver the control side and the colors match up exactly they're going to have white to white we're gonna have black to black I'll run the fan and we're going to have blue for the light kit will be connected to the blue wire so when you make all those splices this is the antenna that that receives the signal from the remote control everything's all tucked up nicely in the box when you mean switches on then you're gonna be able to operate this fan and light with the remote control so I'll make my spices and I'll show you the assembly all tucked up in place now before you make all your connections the factory will have preset these dip switches in the receiver and the transmitter to the factory preset position of all of them in the off now you can set your own remote control code here he'd like just to make sure that if your neighbor happens to have another one of these fans that he's not turning your fan on and off or turning a light on and also select a cold it doesn't matter as long as they match the receiver to the transmitter I like to say put up switch number one and three and that just gives you a different code than the factory preset so don't forget to do that I'll show you a picture what everything's all connected up here with the transmitter and the receiver we'll all wired up in place here so I've got all my splices made here starting with the ground wires of course there's spliced together I've got my powering on this side light black coming into the receiver and then I've got my white blue and black tied into the control side of the receiver here's the antenna now the tricky part is just tucking everything into place making sure that the wires aren't pinched and making sure the canopy fits and then I finish with putting on the canopy screws holding the canopy firmly into place and we're ready to assemble the rest of the fan and then test our work so you've seen a shot now on a tight shot of the canopy all installed in place with the remote receiver all tucked up into the box we've assembled all the fan blades together which is not different than any other ceiling fan you'll encounter don't forget to check our other videos too if you need a more detailed instruction video on how to assemble an entire fam kit so we've got the blades all put together now it's time to start installing the blades onto the motor assembly so they've got all the blades installed it in place tighten down appropriately and just make sure everything's free to move and all it's good so it's time to put on the light kit now so we've got our light kit installed the bulbs installed and the globe foot in place turned on the switch on the wall we've determined to be our master power switch for this bath and now it's time to test our work first the light that works fan I've got the low medium and high buttons on the remote so we'll start low watch your head so you must be working medium takes it up a notch and high now the only controls that are on the fan itself or a reverse switch in case you want that fan to pull air up or push air down so there you have it the installation of a remote-controlled ceiling fan as I mentioned previously if you need more detailed instructions on the installation of a ceiling fan including all the components involved check our website we've got a couple good videos there but for now that's the end of this one thanks for tuning in on the installation of a remote-controlled ceiling fan I am from be Cherokee model", "oN3i6rDZWPM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "0E6zdbS2nLc": "hey lock your OS reviews a while back we checked out the in pods 12s which are macaron coloured air pod clones which were cheerful but also pretty inexpensive well you guys seem to like that quite a bit so today we're taking a look at a newer version but instead of the air pods it's going to be replicating the air pod pros and it's still a one-to-one replica or a clone of the actual air pod pros comes in all these colors that you see on the packaging technically these are called the i500 pro macaron Edition and if you guys recall the I 500 is one of the better clones of the regular air pods and the i500 pro the regular edition is a white variant of the air pod Pro clones so again this basically is part of that same series what's interesting is the macaron series always tends to sell for less than the regular white editions so you can save a few bucks this one sells for under 40 bucks usually if they're versus the regular I 500 pros tends to go for 50 bucks to 80 bucks opinion where you pick it up from in terms of specs the buds themselves will last around for hours on a single charge but the battery case can only provide two additional charges when on the road so we're talking about a combined total of around 12 to 15 hours depending on your listening volume which is a little lower than the other regular edition of the IFF hundred pros otherwise it still has that h1 chip support so whenever you use it with an iOS device like an iPhone if you open up the lid you'll get that pop-up notification that tells you to pair it and tells you the battery status so it's identified as real air pods which is interesting some features which are missing however from the macaron Edition would be support 4G wireless charging from the case inside of the colourful box we have of course the headphones themselves we also get a quick instruction manual and also a standard Apple lightning cable for charging and taking a closer look at the construction and design these macaroon buds still retains the same slick polycarbonate plastic material used on the real air pods so it's still going to be a glossy plastic compared to the standard air pod clone macaron Edition which has a soft touch rubber coating over it if we take a closer look on the back just like with the in pod 12s we see that because of the colored addition it also covers up some of the details such as the design by Apple in California which you'll see on the regular edition of the IEEE 500 pros but not on the macaron series so it's missing a few of those small details but again this is also going to be quite a bit cheaper otherwise they still get very similar in terms of dimensions and the fuelling in the hand the doors are still magnetic so they can pop open and when you open them up the buds will automatically turn on and begin to pair with your device and connect again it is using bluetooth 5.0 so just like other GWS buds these days latency has been much too improved it does support AAC and SBC audio codecs but just like most air pod clones it doesn't come with save Qualcomm's aptX and here's a closer look side-by-side with you regular air pod pros you can see that it gets again extremely close in terms of how they look and feel one slight difference just like with the in pod 12 that we saw it said these have a bit more flashing lights going on you see this flashing red light on the stem of the buds which we again see with the macaron Edition on the air pod pro clones we have in red light but this light does go away after you connect it to your device so it stops flashing I don't mind it too much in fact I think it looks a little bit cool just adds to the overall colorful element of the macaron series and taking a look at them what is interesting is the bottom of the stems do look a little different from the original air pod pros with a small mesh this is actually covered up so technically it's charging using the metal contacts on the rail here but overall a slightly different look but the dimensions of the buds themselves are still extremely close side-by-side the length of the stem is saying the weight is also the same but everything has been colored in terms of the accenting to the rubber tips you also see have the same kind of color match in the buds themselves with that being said some of the small details like the lettering of the serial info from Apple is missing on the macaron series just like from before one other difference I want to point out with the original i500 pros they actually have a touch sensitive area more on the traditional area of the stem can tap on to play and pause your music skip tracks access a Siri or your smart assistant versus on the macaron series the touch sensitive area is actually on this indented little part which is kind of interesting so instead of tapping on it like this you have to tap on it from the side to register your commands however it still is pretty sensitive and easy to use in my testing so far finally the last difference between the original I 500 pros and the macaron Editions is the macaron series doesn't support the autoplay and pause function so the proximity sensors here are just for decoration compared to on these if you remove them from your head the music will automatically pause and when you pop them back in it will automatically resume so before we dive into a discussion on the audio quality I wanted to show you guys that indeed the pop-up notifications do work on your iOS device so when you open up the lid it will automatically register it as the air pods and then it will go away when you close the lid and afterwards it will just always connect once you remove them from the casing you can also go through a quick tutorial on screen tells you how to press on the touch sensitive area to control things some functions from the air pot such as active noise cancellation and the audio transparency mode are still missing so these are still primarily for music listening the functionality is pretty basic just music only but having the look of air pod pros that's pretty convincing so next moving into audio quality and performance as aforementioned the sound itself is pretty close to the regular edition of the eye 500 pros which is to say they do sound better than you'll expect for a replica or a budget pair of tws buds really again you're paying a fraction of the price of the real air pot pros surprisingly there is overall pretty clean sound so if you pause the music there's not too much distortion it's actually quite silent apart from the music itself you won't really hear any hissing or background noise and that's Fi an improvement compared to the in pod 12s these skies here are definitely a little bit cheaper in terms of their construction and also maybe their drivers and parts inside they also sell for less if you guys recall these are under 15 bucks these guys here at under 40 is about twice the price and you do get an upgrade in terms of this sound over I would say that bass is present especially if you're listening to EDM tracks and overall it's pretty thumpy and satisfying but doesn't really overpower other elements at the sound like the mids and trebles mids in particular is where the strengths I think lies so if you're listening to pop music acoustic tracks things like that it definitely still sounds quite impressive pretty much any genre they were listening to for casual music listening whether again pop rock music watching YouTube videos it all works pretty well for video playback the latency is also acceptable there's not too much lack in my testing between the video and the audio is thinking so it did work pretty well although if you're doing things like gaming do you expect a bit more of a latency lag so that's more or less it for our hands-on look at the i500 pro macaron editions although they have the same name as the i500 pro's technically the features here are a slight step down including lack of Qi charging you don't get a proximity sensor for auto play and pause detection but other elements in terms of the sound quality still gets pretty similar in fact almost identical wishes to say very impressive for a budget you know air pod clone or importantly if you like the way that they look you want to add a splash of color and customization to your tws buds then this is definitely going to be an interesting choice to take a closer look at with better audio quality overall than the in pod 12s which are the standard air pod clones and the macaron colors so you can check out more details if you're interested in these cheerful tones for now that's been our video thanks for watching through our OS reviews", "cg3btKPRdwU": "hey everyone see her get stoned here doing another awesome review for you guys today I'm going over a product called timeless I'm going to be trying half gram strong manic art and their rest line if you're not familiar with timeless timeless products come in three different lines they have an energy a chill and a rest line so the rest line is supposed to help you possibly sleep or guide you into rest as I'm gonna be trying that out for you guys today and it says here that they're testing in the 90% range and that they're solvent free distilled THC oil with a hundred percent all natural plant and citrus terpenes so let's try it you open it the package your cartridge comes in this little childproof file it's a push down and unscrew I also have a timeless battery here to try our timeless cart with it's a 5-10 thread screw on it is buttonless so it's pulled to draw so you just need to hit it to activate it which is awesome and it's already set at the ideal temperature so that's really fun and as you can see here that it has a standard USB charger but it does not have a charging light indicator on it instead the timeless battery will light up at the bottom and then turn off when it's dead charging my have pre charge my timeless batteries so I could try my new timeless cart screw this one mmm it's really soft and smooth I have initial notes of fruit flavor little bit of straw strawberry banana it tastes like BAM give it that it's tasty it was delivered well so I really like it it's really tasty um it's also cool timeless comes with cases which you can put your pan in after dance now that I'm done using my medicine I could store it in here overall I feel sensations of relaxation and calmness um we'll see if it guides me into rest I'll leave that at a later date on the description of this video so thanks again thank you to timeless for let me try their best car and thank you to my viewers for watching my videos and you guys have a great day", "NACNn1-Cw6M": "hey guys this is Jarrett here with team adventures with BG and if you've ever ripped off the pool tab of your GoPro battery like I have I'm gonna show you a way to try and repair that at least temporarily so as you can see there's no pool tab on that battery they normally look like this but I rip mine off probably the first time I use that battery and I've been searching for a way to repair that so the way I found as I had my tape and I cut kind of a tee and wrap it around the top of the battery allows me to pull it off I've got got a a knife here that'll allow me to do you know some nice cuts ruler a marker so I can kind of see where I'm going and then my GoPro to test so when the pull tabs not working when I put this battery in I have to kind of clamp on it like that I'm sure it's not good for anything so I've come up with this way to do it stay tuned and we'll I'll show you exactly what I do alright so we've got our tools here we're ready to go we need about a little over an inch and a half should work you could maybe even go up to quarter or 3/4 of an inch but I think that may be a little too much and the tape is nice and sticky it should be a good sign for getting this to work and then we only need about an inch and a half so I'll trim away some of this you want to make sure that you've got get your pull tab on the right side so you know check with another battery I don't know if it will work if you do it the wrong way and then see so this is just going to kind of go over that pull tab area get it centered or better than I did that time have it hug the sides and then we'll work on making this a little bit smaller it's probably too much tape in there so you can cut half of it two-thirds of it away that's kind of what I recommend let's fix that up a little bit does it matter probably not but you know straight lines feel better got that song okay and then one of the final touches will be taking something like that one you just cut or cutting another piece to fit and sticking it on this side that way your pull tab won't actually stick to the GoPro when they have just a little bit too much excess here let's give it a try and see if it'll slide in there alright looks like we got it closed powered on it's a good sign but you can see the door is kind of bulged right there moment truth I'll ride successfully pulled it and so I've got unfurl this for a second and just make it a little smaller cut that off it seems to be a little messed up on the side there and I don't want that piece coming over the top because then it definitely won't close stick it back in there or clothes still kind of bulged I don't know that I wouldn't trust this in water so you know if you're gonna use this I would make sure this is a dry battery pulls out just fine you know and as you practice you can probably make things a little closer and it'll fit a lot better and in my testing I got about two to five on each pull before things started ripping so it's definitely a temporary solution but it's one little work and make your life a lot easier thanks for watching if you want to see any other GoPro videos let us know if you've got a better solution leave that down in

it'd be pretty hot what's up everybody youtube's been really busting my balls about their community guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks hey what up before we start this cart video usually the cart videos just don't have a lot of smoke in the air there's not a lot of you know big smoke so we got to fix that with this cheers everybody oh my god i'm doing exactly what i needed all righty man i think that's exactly the type of hit that we needed to start out a video you know when you get a hit like that the video is just going to start out good man but this video is not about the dab so i guess in a way it kind of is man we're talking about some cards today some really [ __ ] expensive cards it's the whole reason why you clicked on this video so listen you've probably if you're especially in a medicinal state medicinal only state you've probably gone to a dispensary and seen some absolute [ __ ] cart prices like forty dollars for a half gram of distilling which is like mind blowing like 80 gram of [ __ ] [ __ ] like get out of here bro then you get the live resin carts which can be around the exact same [ __ ] prices like 40 on the half gram it really depends on where you live because california i mean i've seen live resin carts go for 35 on the full gram i've seen some [ __ ] dislike for 40 i've seen dislike for like 10 15 so it's just it's just really depending on where you live but these bad boys right here these pod tones made straight in la are 55 wait for it not for a half gram they're 55 for a 0.3 i don't know if you can see it right there on the bottom net weight 300 milligrams so usually it's a thousand milligrams for a gram cart and uh if you were to buy three of these which i only bought two because i'm not a [ __ ] maniac if you were to buy three of these bad boys it would be 160 dollars and you still wouldn't get a full grand you'd get point one off it's like someone skimped you on a full gram cart now of course if we're gonna buy all this [ __ ] we gotta have a sponsor for the video you guys know who the sponsor is i absolutely [ __ ] love them they've been with us every single month for over a year now adam and eve just the wonderful people over there listen man this this [ __ ] and sex kind of go right hand in hand i'm not gonna lie what's better than getting baked and getting late it's like my motto damn you can get 50 off any single item and free shipping if you use my code con and uh obviously you guys are using that [ __ ] because they're coming back so often so listen shout out to you guys that are using it maybe you guys even use it consistently i bet you i have several people that watch every month and get reminded and they're like oh yeah i need my monthly sex toy you [ __ ] freaks i like that [ __ ] shout out to you guys that's awesome like i said for guys girls anything in between just anything you know what i mean whatever you're into they have it i promise go check them out it's good stuff maybe a little birthday is coming up or something you know it's just surprising anyway these little bad boys right here these expensive ass [ __ ] i haven't even opened this one yet so i'm excited to try this one out these are made from rosin like i said so if you don't know if you need the breakdown explanation of live resin rosin difference and all that i made an in-depth video right here it's like 20 minutes pretty [ __ ] long but if you want like the one minute breakdown distillate which is probably like 80 or 90 of what you see on the market it's a majority of what you see is made from a process of just nasty like crude cannabis oil pretty much and it goes through a distillation process over and over like two three times and then you eventually get a very pure thc extract it's like upwards of 99 just thc but the only problem with that is just like distilled water there's nothing else that comes along with that like extracted thc it just gets you high there's no flavor behind it there's no profile there's no nothing it's just like distilled water it's it's like it's flat zero so if your distillate cart tastes like something it was most likely added terpenes after there's artificial terpenes are there's actual live resin terpenes but even if you add live resin terps to the distillate it's still a distillate cart a lot of brands will try to get away with that they'll have like on their packaging it'll be like live resin terpenes like a little small little thing it's like it's 90 distillate which is not awful i just personally don't like smoking it now live resin on the other hand is a lot different live resin comes from actual cannabis plants so as soon as the cannabis plant is grown instead of hanging in drying it gets frozen and then you extract it through a variety of like butane processes or gas processes whatever then you get an extract at the end of it which unlike distillate already has all the plant profile in it because you just got it from the full plant so you don't have to worry about adding any [ __ ] after any cutting agents or you have to worry about any of that because it's the it's the full cannabis profile plant and i love it because if you get like a gorilla glue live resin cart it is so much different than getting a gorilla glue distillate cart with like just some gorilla glue terpenes after it's just it doesn't taste the same it's not even close to the same and the feeling that's the main thing the feeling is way different because you don't get what is called the entourage effect entourage effect is pretty much all the cannabinoids working together to make you feel a certain way so you know you necessarily don't get higher off a bong rip but you get like feeling good off of a boundary but when you take a fat rip of a distillate cart like yeah you get higher but it's like not the same you don't feel like the body high it's just like a real like a it's like an unclean high you feel like you're just getting too much thc and not enough for something else which is exactly why i don't like it but this [ __ ] on the other hand rosin which i know i think specifically people in the northwest have known about rosin cars forever because when i was there for hemp fest i think 2019 i saw several people several people came up to me like homies and fans and [ __ ] and they're like yo bro like smoke this rosin card like it's all we smoke out here and i was like what i was like damn that's a lit like even cali's not even on the rosin card set heavy if they are they're taxed as [ __ ] as you can see ridiculous rosin is a whole other game than live resin because live resin you need a gas or some type of extraction kind of like butane propane whatever method to get it out rosin you use very simple heat and pressure you literally get a nug you put it between two plates you can even put it between a hair [ __ ] dresser a hair dryer or whatever i've seen a lot of people do that on youtube and [ __ ] crazy i don't know if i'd recommend that but you squeeze it out at a very specific temperature and a whole bunch of juices come out and those juices are what you're smoking so you don't need any sort of additive or any sort of extraction really like crazy method it's very like simple it's almost primitive in a way you just [ __ ] squeeze it juice come out monkey smoke you know that's really what it is it's [ __ ] dope you get the whole plant profile with it without needing any circus sometimes if you're not a very good extractor with live resin you know there's a lot of companies that are qualified a lot of individuals that are qualified but sometimes if you're doing black market shade there's a lot of live resin out there that like these are you know amateur extractors and the live resin isn't as tasty and there's too much butane in there there's too much like they didn't extract it right it's just there's a lot of [ __ ] that can go wrong obviously like i said this [ __ ] even an ape could do it's very primitive you get two hot rocks and just squish a [ __ ] nug in between and i'm pretty sure that's how they were making like juices and [ __ ] back in the day like it's the same method but we just smoke it this one that we're smoking right now it says notes of chocolate berries and citrus with a relaxing body high and a positive mood lift it's a little bit cap i'm not gonna lie i don't know about the chocolate but i do taste the berries and citrus i'm not gonna lie pod toads are made from full spectrum whole plant rosin extracted from premium flowers for a natural and delicious entourage effect like i was saying entourage effect beautiful i like how they said that on there no added flavors whatsoever 100 cannabis rosin made in los angeles good [ __ ] right there so here's the craziest thing that i think is on this whole package right here it says it uses over 1 8 of buds for this i listen dude i'm not a professional i'm not trying to like tell any brand what they should and shouldn't do but like damn that's crazy dude i feel like i got two rosin presses right over there i can show you i'm literally just whipping around real quick those two bad boys right there i can get like a grandma rosin off of an eighth probably but then again i have to like extract it once more to be able to put it in the cart so maybe that's about right maybe they are using some real gas in these bad boys it better be for 55 a goddamn point three they better be man technically if there's an eighth of buds in here you're paying for like a 55 eighth which is very in line i guess with other la prices indoor prices top shelf prices whatever you want to call it this one that i'm opening right now oh [ __ ] there's some uh try them all it says up fun chill and dream see that's another thing that i'm not exactly too sure about i i'm not too big of a fan of when carts say that stuff for like because it's very it's marketed towards like the karen that just walks into the dispensary for the first time and she's like i just want something to have me chill and it's like they sell these to them in the beverly hills or like west [ __ ] hollywood and then they're like all right yeah like i'll pay that amount but i feel like to a connoisseur that really enjoys rosin that enjoys like because i feel like they're not getting appreciated they're the type to be like well why would i spend 55 or 50 or whatever the price is on 300 milligrams when i could spend like 20 on this a thousand milligrams this one over here they don't understand the difference so it's like it's a very weird marketing i'd say it's a weird grab right here i will say that pod tones i think you should uh put some strains on here i think it'll be a lot more desirable to the people that love rosin you know i mean that are very interested in the extraction game in the actual cannabis profile and trying to get a specific flavor specific you know terpene profile so i mean i don't know hey i'm not trying to tell anyone how to run their uh their little shming skis right here but hey this one's called the dream i will say that these are [ __ ] these are it when it comes to just the profile of them this is one of my favorite looking disposables maybe ever it probably is the shape the feel and i'm not sure if it's plastic it might be a little bit metal like maybe metal coated or something aluminum coated it's fire though it feels good in the hand it's like cold to the touch you know what i mean you know sometimes you get the plastic ones and it's like whatever it i'm a big fan of build quality sex appeal i'll call it a lot of people call it box of peel or look a peel but i mean come on bro these are pretty sexy like just objectively even if you got all four you were just ripping it it'd be pretty hot i will say that after a couple days though they do get they do expect you to finish in a couple days which i respect they're expecting you to chief on these because they do get clogged if you're not chiefing them like very consistently that was very nice let's get a little dream rip in and let's read the description i like if you can read the description and then taste it at the same time i feel like it just enhances some things maybe it's a little bit of a placebo but who knows let's see a perfumey floral bouquet that okay did i say that right like a bouquet of flowers i might be tweaking that delivers full body tension release perfect for letting it all go at the end of the day so it's a indica i imagine some sort of strain very heavy maybe a little og i will say that the airflow off a fresh pod is [ __ ] way better than this man like i said they expect you to [ __ ] go through these very fast dope it tastes good i like it i mean [ __ ] i don't know if i'd spend another 55 on the other one i feel like at this point if i already have half of them might as well go for the other half some point right i don't know they're expensive as [ __ ] though are they worth it probably not i don't know i feel like the common theme on my channel is just like i'm a [ __ ] cheap bastard man that's that's the whole point of the channel damn near if you were to just watch every video you'd be like damn this [ __ ] doesn't like spending money at all like dude i don't know i just feel like 55 for a point three like come on like they're dope and everything but like i said you guys in the northwest you guys been smoking rosin for a fat minute man a hot minute you guys have been smoking rosin cars you can probably get a gram i think even in the northeast i've seen some people in boston a little massachusetts gang where are you at man i have seen some people with rosin cars over there you're probably getting full grams of rosin what 50 or 60. come on a third of rosin a third of a gram for 55. i said a third of a rosin what the [ __ ] does that mean it has been the whole video we haven't taken a blinker which i think is pretty [ __ ] up so without further ado let's do a little blinky action man cheers everybody oh yeah wow that was a very short blinker but i feel like that was an appropriate amount of smoke like that was that was a solid blinker bro i've definitely taken 10 second blinkers that didn't have that much vapor i would have to rate them if i had to give them out of 10 including the price including everything within the packaging the feel the the high that you give with it the flavors taste but mainly the price with mind i'd have to give these a solid seven and a half like uh as the price gets cheaper i feel like the stars would go up you know i'm just that much of a [ __ ] cheap bastard whatever that's my final review on these bad boys listen you guys are [ __ ] crazy i appreciate you oh they're just knocked over no i knocked over my torch we're all right shout out to um i don't know you guys i don't know i was gonna say shout out to adam and eve there you go for the sponsor i was like i didn't get sent these but these are pretty cool cool little somethings man i just always like pointing out making videos on expensive ass things when i see them out in the cannabis world i got a 120 gram of rosin that i'm about to make a video on like in a few days that shit's [ __ ] like like what why is it so expensive like it doesn't even make sense dude so thank you guys for watching so much i appreciate you make sure to check out adam and eve make sure to check out the code you know use the code get sent off check out these if you're a big baller if you like some rosin carts if you're in the northwest just laugh at people on the california coast that are smoking [ __ ] these for a ridiculous price you know the crazy thing is i always go to a certain dyspo in west hollywood that has these and they [ __ ] are sold out of them all the time so that means they're hot on the shelves people are buying them i wonder what the market is man i'd be very interested anyone at pod tones watch this video check them out i kind of i didn't [ __ ] on it i gave it a seven and a half it's a good score right there be very interested in knowing more about the company like just your demographics and stuff if you had a breakdown of this i wonder if it's rosin enthusiasts or like karen's and moms that are just trying to get high and [ __ ] i don't know i love you guys thanks for being here thanks for chilling i'll see you very very soon on the next video and uh i'll stop slacking i promise i love you see you soon you", "aTQGBS5C6mo": "good to have water inflate the mouth gets nice and dry from this steady wind in the face and from smiling so much", "eQqyIwbXLEI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and realme has been launching a lot of earbuds in the past year or so read me about air the dreamy buzz neo buzz q buzz wireless birds air pro yeah that's a lot and now they've launched this the read me bugs air 2. now these are something that actually got me interested because these bring active noise cancellation at just rupees 3300 so instead of focusing on the nasophones i decided to use this full time and this is a real me buzz air 2 review okay so let's keep things crisp and nice from the design front the readme buds air 2's case is basically the buzzer pro case with the same over design usb c port but without the little chrome thingy on the back as for the earbuds design it's a little different and it's something i personally not call good looking but i'd say it's interesting so as you can see it has this two-tone design with the stem featuring a chrome silver look while the earbuds are the usual white with silicone tips i mean the looks are subjective so to each their own but i don't really like this design as for the earbuds they are ipx7 rated so they should be fine with sweat and some rain and these earbuds are also very light and they fit in my ear perfectly now here's akshay doing his thing and yeah they fit in right and shouldn't fall off during workouts as for the comfort these are budged earbuds and i'd say they are oakish comfort wise when i was using this continuously for half an hour or less i found them to be fine but when i was using them for longer like an hour or two hours i did feel the need to remove them and give my ears a break so yeah i'd say okay now the design apart the big usp of the redmi buzz a2 is obviously active noise cancellation now if you think about it in this price segment there is the readme buds a pro and the oppo encode w51 that bring the active noise cancellation feature but they are priced around 5000 rupees and the readme buzz air to bring anc to an even lower price segment which is actually great so the ream buzzer 2 has a feed forward mic to cut down the noise and it can cut down noise up to 25 db which is lesser than the 35 db mark of the air pro but let's talk about the experience so there are three modes noise cancellation for max noise reduction general for you know slight noise reduction and transparency mode which lets you hear everything from the outside world and you know talk to other people now as you can see i can switch between the two noise cancellation modes by just press holding the touch sensor on the readme but there too now as for the experience the noise cancellation on the readme buzz a2 actually works fairly well now it's not as good as higher priced earphones quite obviously and it won't have an impact on higher frequencies but it does a good job of reducing sounds from say a computer fan engine rumble car horns in the distance so it's good that way and if you play music the noise cancellation is even more impactful so it's good see i think noise cancellation at this price is a big deal especially because this actually works i mean a lot of earphones which have anc don't make a lot of difference so this is pretty good for the price now apart from anc the biggest factor when it comes to wireless earbuds is the sound quality so the real me was there to have 10 millimeter high five drivers and when it comes to codex asc is supported but qualcomm's aptx is not now to get to the point state i think the sound quality of the readme buzz a2 is very good i was using the oneplus but z before this and when i switched to the bird's air too i was like these does not sound like earphones that cost three thousand rupees i mean if you've used the higher priced birthday pro let me tell you that the buzzer 2 brings similar good sound quality there are a lot of positives here they're very loud almost crazy loud the bass is nice and thumping the sound stage is wide and the balance between the lows mids and the treble is pretty good for the price look if you ask me it's hard to find negatives in these earbuds especially considering the price point but if i have to tell you the negatives i think at the max volume some songs do sound a bit sharp shrill but it's not a big deal because these earphones are so loud i mostly listen to them at 60 70 1. so the sound is good but since these earphones are so loud there's a lot of sound leakage let me just show you so these are the earbuds at 100 volume and i think you can listen to the sound leakage right now moving on to the mic performance my experience with budget tws earbuds when it comes to the microphone has been kind of underwhelming and the readme buzz a2 is kind of on the same line now when it comes to the calls it gets the job done when you are in a no noise environment but if you want to use it in a noisy state with maybe wind you'll find them practically useless and it's not like other earbuds in this segment do a better job at this i found the same issues with previous readme earbuds and the oneplus buzz which i was using see the point is we need better mics in the budget dws earbuds to give you a better idea on the mic quality this is me talking from the readme buzz a2 and i think the sound quality from these microphones on the reemy buzzer 2 is a little inconsistent at times it sounds fine but other times it cuts down a lot of noise making the voice unnatural so this is the real way buzz a pro now and i think the real me buzz air to sound better than this because this seems to be doing a lot more because noise cancellation making the voice all muffled kind of lastly is the oneplus but z and when i tested them i found the mice quality to be similar to the real me buzz a2 but yeah let us know in the comments which mics quality did you like more as for the connectivity and pairing this bluetooth 5.2 here with google fast pair support and that means pairing is pretty easy you just open up the case and you get this prompt to pair the earphones and yeah this proper price on all phone brands not just real me which is nice now as for the connectivity i did not face any weird connection drops or stutters while using the buzzer too with smartphones other than tv smartphones now that's good but one thing i did notice is that there's no way to connect multiple devices and then switch between them next up i want to talk about the features and the real me link app now first up a lot of you guys always have this doubt about earbuds getting updates well when i first played the readme buzz a2 with the redmi link app i got an update so yeah we can expect updates now this is the readme buzz a2s page in the realme link app and the ui is surprisingly clean and nice anyways along with the noise cancellation modes you get these three sound effects bass boost plus which really really amplifies bass but i don't like it much because in this mode the bass kind of starts to outshine the instruments and the vocals there's lively the mode i use because this is balanced in terms of treble and bass and then there's clear which focuses on the vocals and i think this can be useful for podcasts audiobooks etc there's also volume enhancer here which i think is the reason why the earbuds are so so loud anyway the birthday 2 support wear detection and i found it to work well no issues here there are also the usual touch controls which are hit and miss at the start but once i got used to the idea that it's located at the top end of the stem i found it to work fine apart from that there's game mode which i think is super important because i have used the readme bugs air in the past and the latency in those earbuds was crazy so back then i used to play pubg with those earbuds yeah so good old days and it was almost unplayable with the latency in the buzzer now the buzzer 2 without the game mode is still pretty average when it comes to latency while playing say cod mobile now with the game mode turned on it's better the latency does reduce but it's still not absolutely perfect or anything lastly the battery life so the buzzer 2 has a 30 image battery on each of the earbuds and a 400 mah battery on the case which is kind of on the lower side when compared to say the oneplus bhz but with the real me r2 chip realme claims better battery performance and the buzzer 2 are rated to last 5 hours on continuous usage and that's with anc off and a total of 25 hours with the case which yeah sounds good now in my usage i got around 4 hours 50 minutes with anc turned off on continuous usage which is i think good and with nc turned on i got around four hours which again is pretty decent as for the charging the case takes around two hours to charge while the earbuds get to 100 in around an hour well to conclude things should you buy the real me buds a2 at rupees 3300 well my answer is yes i mean yes the readme buzzer to have its pros and its cons but i think the pros definitely outweighs costs i mean the pros are the big ones like the sound quality is fantastic it brings anc on a budget and the noise cancellation is actually good for the price then there's the fact that the smart features work fine and the battery life is good now coming to the cons the comfort could have been better the my quality is okay but that's a problem with most budget tws the game mode is kind of fine so yeah these earbuds are not perfect and if you have issues with any of these points you should not get the buzz there too but if you're okay with these points i think the real me buzzer 2 are a very good pair of tws earbuds to buy i think they bring a great balance between features and price well that was my review of the read me buds a2 but i want to know what you guys think so tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it make sure to share with your friends

easy and now I kind of got that area opened up a little bit because I mean the syringe diameter is a lot bigger than the paperclip diameter whoever's still kind of over the tip of the syringe there if I can get up a face see I just need to get that rubber to come off the tip of the syringe and then we can start deploying the oil I think actually I might have done it with the paperclip and that might have helped get the rubber kind of all the way out of the way and get broke off a piece of rubber oops okay well now it's in there I actually shoved it in there with the paperclip in there and then pulled the paper cut out so now the syringe is all the way into the cartridge and well now we want to give it slow twists and slowly let the oil come out of the syringe and we don't want to let the syringe come out of the cartridge while the pressure is being applied to the oil we're gonna pull the syringe on the cartridge we need to let the pressure stop being applied all right it's just uh can I buy everything give it a few twists oh I was going the wrong way the air comes and this part can be a little tedious but less is more with these twists because one little twist is gonna give you a good amount of oil that's not even like a quarter turn turning it like it was a clock like one hour if it was the hour hand it's pretty cool lives for sure [Music] so I hear on that side I probably like one more twist and then I'll have to let the air like move all the way to the top and the bottom by hitting it a couple times can just do that for you I definitely say the hardest part is getting that syringe into the rubber part but you know doing it a few times you'll get the hang of it and it'll become easier so now that I'm done and I want to pull the syringe out I'm going to twist it so that the the plunger moves back away so I know the oil isn't pressed up I like all the way against the top here and then let it kind of hang out for a second so that you know that you've sucked most of the oil I kind of out of that syringe I mean a little bit of oil might pop out with it something else that happened to me last time is this metal piece actually came off of the plastic for the tip of the syringe that metal piece there and this little piece there so I'd watch out for that but I was able to like push it back in what happened I mean definitely macgyvering this here but you know saving some money and it's gonna leave a little indent there you know looks like the oil might you know ease its way back out but the rubber roll will hold it it won't push past that rubber there what looks like just at the five minute mark there in the video so that's actually not bad I mean about five minutes to fill up the cartridge there and the paper clip technique I think definitely helped get the syringe into the cartridge there and I still have about half down of oil left in this guy here so I can fill up a whole nother cartridge I really hope this helps out Sarah happy holidays happy

for a setup that's small that's petite that's discreet that hits like a freaking sub ohm tank well then look no further than this Nord kit from schmuck that's right it's schmuck they're the Cavs have made the Novo kit which this is basically a larger version of that okay with better features in my opinion oh this gonna be subjective I'm always gonna point that out but I like this so much better than a novo kid man first of all our houses ain't eleven hundred million power battery which goes and goes and goes second of all it's got a manual switch no automatic switch to me that's another Pro third of all holds three bills easy liquid a pod style system the holes three mils of juice that's a lot and fourth it comes with a metrical head baby mesh go ahead yeah that Bates a B+ flavor B+ and I'm comparing that to other mesh coeds out there like the Falcon coeds the I Troy coeds at least that's experiences that I've had with the three mesh squids that I've tried off this yeah I've tried three different mesh codes for this Nord kit it blows all the other pasta systems out of the water to me again all this gonna be subjective and I'm always gonna point that out the juice that I'm rocking in here is Reds apple yeah I'm rocking a freebase juice and if you never had Reds Apple old man if you're looking for a freakin apple juice that'll knock your socks off look no further in this Reds Apple and you can get it on over at fake tree comm VAP et Rik first things first go and do me a lung hit off this puppy checker paper production off this Auntie bitty titty thing and this thing keeps up on the wiki man that's with heavy BG juices man packs a flippin punch for the size this thing oh yeah by the way this mesh quit in here reads 0.6 oh now they give you another coil a one point 4 ohm round wire just rigger the round wire coil head and that's meant for your mouth longer but to be honest with you I don't like it I mean I don't mind it the flavor I get to average and I could care less about the mouth alone with this like I said this Nord kit is for that sub ohm tank vapor that likes they're a nice restrictive lung in you look for that nice restrictive lung here in a small setup that's what this is can I emphasize that enough this is a huge winner just because it's size alone in the battery life in the mesh go ahead and the manual switch I am in freaking love like I said two weeks up in use this cannot put it down Smok holy [ __ ] yes yes yes so here's the packaging the smart Nord kit comes and of course inside that packaging you're gonna receive your nord kits a USB cable to charge that kit comes with two coil heads a warranty card and of course a user manual the three color options I personally seen for this puppy checker is the red black and white and black just to give y'all a size comparison on my left is the stick VPC by I just did a video on it if you miss it links down in the description and then on my right of course is the nord now the north as you guys can see it is shorter but it is wider and it is thicker but they both have about the same weight too on this side of the nord you got a honeycomb pattern panel and then on the other side you got a honeycomb pattern panel but yeah on this side you get the on/off switch up top set Smok down here you got the mouthpiece love this freaking mouthpiece it's wide it does have a wide hole up top so the drawl is gonna be a little bit looser you can still do your mountain lungs off this but I prefer to do my lung heads but yeah I've fallen in love with this mouthpiece SuperDuper comfortable you got a little tank you see that little slot that's the tank opening and you pull this sucker out like so it is tight I mean it's got a tight fit which is good that's what you want but yeah she comes out like so there's your tank so you're gonna see this portion this little itty bitty portion that maybe a Cana some of you guys cuz you're really not gonna be able to see you in the levels use drops you got to pull it out every time you want to see the level you choose that's what I mean so yeah inside the mod you got your connections at the bottom of the tank you get a little opening for your calls like I showed you before you get two cool heads and then on this side of the pod you got a little plug so you pull that out you fill her up once you insert your cool heads I'm going to show you that in a second and then of course at the top you got a big ol opening big old nice opening like I showed you before and I'm going to show you again you get two cool heads you get a point six OMS coil head that uses organic cotton and you get this one point four om standard round wire coil okay that uses organic cotton the one point four is meant for your mouth to lungs and the draw like I said it's not super tight it's nice but this one right here this point six own it's been for you restricted lung headers nice comfortable restricted lung head and the flavor I get off this is easily a B+ first pot like style system that I've seen use mesh coil heads so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and stall this mesh go into the tank and in order to do that what you got to do is turn this puppy chakra upside down and then slider in she'll press fit and then all you got to do from there is just pull the plug out and fill her up pull that any bitty plug out and there's your hole nice sized hole too oh yeah and this tank holds 20 mils of juice another big Pro when you're done filling her up you just plug her up and you want to let this thing sit for a good 10 minutes that cotton in that coil heads got to soak up all the juice if you don't let it sit and you go take a hit you could potentially burn out the coil head and it's gonna be useless so be patient guys but yet back in the noir month like I said up top that's where your freaking tank slides into it slides in it makes a connection and then all you got to do is turn her on it's got a built-in eleven hundred million power battery here's your on/off switch not only your on/off switch but this is your fire button too so unlike the smock novo kit they had an automatic firing switch this is not in my opinion that's a huge Pro cuz if you want to do your mouth of lungs and you think the drawers too loose it's okay the manual switch will allow you to take primer puffs wear as a kid that has an automatic switch it's a little bit harder to do this primer puffs five clicks this fire button turns wrong one two three four five and you can check the battery life of this puppy checker and in order to do that what you got to do is hit the on/off switch or fire button two times one two see how it lit up green that means she's fully charged now if the lights up yellow or orange I mean she's Midway charged and if it lights up red that means you got to charge her up go ahead and slide the tank in there and I love the freaking resistance man it fits super tight you never have to worry about this thing coming loose and another thing to point out and the two weeks I've been used this thing I've never had any Jews pull up in here and I've used three different tanks for this bad boy oh yeah and every time you pop this sucker in here she's gonna light up white really guys the only thing I would change for this device is the juice window I would make the juice window just a little bit larger so I can see the level of my eliquid probably price point price point I'm seeing this polka checker sale online anywhere between thirty and forty bucks you know me I'll post a link down the description of the site

some people are asking how did i get out of this mess so first of all i don't know what kind of hole that is it almost looked like an animal hole of some sort but when i first hit that hole i looked back and all i could see was the hole below me collapse out right where that arrow's at that whole area collapsed out and fell in for a split second there i didn't know if i was gonna fall down a mine shaft or something it was scary so what we did was we started knocking snow down in the hole to somewhat fill the hole up and once we had the hole filled up a little bit we pivoted the bike back up and then towards the easiest side we could and then we got three or four guys on the front ski and forks and they pulled and i gassed it and we pulled it out", "q465iYfGMhE": "Hello my friends!

price tag of 5000 rupees in the sale you will be able to get them for about 4 500 rupees should you buy this these are called as pro because they support anc which is active noise cancellation meaning when you pull them out of this and attach these you can long press here and it will start noise cancellation meaning you will you will not be able to hear things around you but basically if these are your first pair of tws earphones with anc then remember anc does not mean that it will clear out everything like if someone is talking you will still be able to hear that with anc turned on let's start with the build quality this is how the case opens and the mechanism is pretty good it doesn't open automatically if i do this if i it doesn't open automatically which is obviously a very good thing considering the price tag of 5000 rupees i was not expecting them to come out automatically build quality wise the case is definitely great i saw minor scratches on the back because i was using them and using them roughly basically that's quite normal with any tws earphones usb type-c port is present at the bottom side which can be used for charging these earphones and when you connect them to your smartphone with the real me link application you will be able to see what's the battery of case what's the battery percentage of the left earbud and of the right earbuds so that you can charge it accordingly and the earbuds will fast charge when you keep them inside the case and real me claims battery life of 20 hours with nc turned on and 25 hours with anc turned off that's obviously at 50 volume you will be able to get about 17 to 18 hours of battery life with the earbuds this is not one time usage obviously uh these earbuds can last about four hours with anc turned on and at eighty two hundred percent volume but once they drain out you will have to keep them back inside and after using them once again then you charge them once again and this way you can get about 17 to 18 hours of battery life with anc turned on and at about 80 of volume with anc turned off real me claims 25 hours of battery life i was not able to test how long i can get because almost all the time i had the anc turned on because with anc turned on it actually sounds pretty good now let's talk about the sound quality overall i would say if i have to compare the real me buds air pro against the real me buds wireless pro then i personally liked how the real me buds wireless pro sounded and that has always been the case at the price tag of 2000 rupees you will always find the neck banks sounding better as compared to tws earphones at the breaststroke of 4000 or 5000 rupees i liked realty but wireless pro more as compared to this one but obviously this is tws you are buying these and not the neckband because you want something which doesn't have any wire for that i feel like the sound quality was good when it comes to bass bass boost plus mode is available in the real me link application but even after enabling that i did not enjoy the sound quality that much because when i enabled it i felt as if the vocals or the singer's voice was not as good as it was with bass boost mode turned off now it's time to talk about some of the songs that i listen to and my experience so i have got my book let's talk about the songs by raghav chaitanya this is a very fantastic song when i turned on bass boost mode i felt that the sound quality was not as good as it was without the bass boost mode on first day of challah by mohit chawan also sounded pretty good gold mess by pretty quad has few parts where i feel like good earphones produce very good sound quality and i felt with the real me but air pro it did a very good job so overall if you are expecting these earphones to be very busy then that's not going to happen if you listen to normal typical songs it does produce decent amount of bass but it's not busy i would still say that i felt that real me buds wireless pro produce little bit more bass as compared to these ones does anc actually work in these earphones then absolutely it works i was able to notice the difference with anc turned on and anc turned off you get three pair of ear tips in the box uh the ones which were pre-installed but did not fit really good in my ear so i changed it to the smallest one usually smallest ones are the ones which fit perfectly but still i did not have that confidence of walking or running after wearing these i've always felt as if they will fall now or if i start running it will fall i had that uh thing in my mind so when it comes to fit i am going to say at least with my particular year i did not get that confidence they will not fall if i do like this as you can see right now it's not falling but i i felt that this one came little bit out so what i'll do is i'll just attach it once again and make it go inside and now it's good once again i i felt that it came out just a slight bit it's not falling as you can see it's not falling even now but that confidence that you need to have by wearing tws while walking outside or while going inside a train don't go but still if you need to go then you will always have that thing in mind because once it falls in a crowded place all the best finding it now let's talk about the real mailing application as you can see it is showing real me bird's air pro i'll just click on that it will show battery life 70 on the left side 80 on the right side you can change noise cancellation to general to transparency from the app itself uh game mode can be turned on volume enhancer is something which i had turned on on this device and it worked really good in my opinion in the wireless birds pro watch my review of that which will be in the eye button over here in that i said i did not like volume ensensor in that particular pair of neckband in this one i turned on volume enhancer and i was testing with bass boost on and bass boost off i personally prefer to turn it off double tap and triple tap setting can be changed from the app itself just click over here and these are the only options that you will get there is no way to control the volume like you can't just slide up or slide down to reduce or increase the volume that's not possible these just cost 5 000 rupees so i guess that's little bit too much to expect and that's pretty much it for the app and connectivity as well bluetooth 5.0 is present it does not support lda codec which is fine it supports asc codex so with the oneplus 8t and even with the poko x3 it sounded uh similar i would say with the asc codec overall i would say uh i liked how this sounded it just that it did not fit perfectly in my ear one thing which i missed last time was called quality i'm not going to miss it this time so directly so this is how it sounds i did not go outside with the earphones as it's pandemic i can't really go out much but this is how the earphone sounds definitely it sounds very good for calls it can be used 100 without any issues if you are looking for great pws for calling then these are definitely the good ones and i guess that's not it for this particular video if you enjoyed it give this

what's good everybody jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with a west coast we tour unboxing featuring vessel brand and their elite battery this is one of the most exquisite vaporizer batteries in the entire cannabis industry i'm a huge fan of just the luxuriousness of their brand of their products i've used this uh well i don't know i haven't used this exact device but i've used a similar device about a year or so ago so i'm pretty excited um we're gonna do an unboxing kind of check out the charging stand what's inside their deluxe charging case and then of course we're gonna break this down and we're gonna actually try this out today we're gonna end up trying this out actually i'm sorry this is going to be on the leaf works cured resin cartridge we're going to check this out so the first things first i want to read a little bit of information about the vessel and again i'll show you guys the battery this beautiful sleek platinum blue gray with the wood here

2.8 3.2 and 3.6 wow this is incredible check this out you guys look how beautiful this is and so the battery is this in itself absolutely beautiful this wooden grip here then you've got the button here and then you'll insert the you'll insert the cartridge through this up there and so this is where you can kind of get into the actual area it's pretty simple just to twist it on um when it comes to the charging port i forget where it is oh i'm sorry it's a twist on so you'll plug in the charge you'll plug in the usb and then you'll twist on the back side right into here magnetic super dope that is pretty freaking cool so for now let's turn it on fun two three four five we got three it's on green all right this means that we can dive into the leaf works cured resin so super excited uh when it comes to leaf works they're based in wenatchee washington it's in eastern washington it's about two hours or so away from seattle they are well known for using single source they grow and cultivate their own flower and then they put it into their own oil they are truly soiled to oil and the single source difference here on the back all leaf works products are single source meaning they are made from 100 leaf works grown cannabis this single source production allows leaf works to deliver products that are consistent clean and terpene focused from soil to oil super dope uh only cannabis no additives no botanical terps no cutting agents no heavy metals no pesticides cultivated by leafworks at leafworks on twitter instagram youtube facebook uh all that it's absolutely beautiful absolutely look at the color on that resin there so let's dive right in we're gonna do a one hit review i'm gonna talk about it give you guys an idea of the taste and the flavor and then i'll hit it again and give you guys a score out of 10. it's very important with the vapes that you do hit it more than once because the first hit might be a little bit extra terpy whereas the second hit or the third hit might be a little hot difference and so you want that balance perspective per usual with these carts um you got the little rubber stopper here at the bottom you guys can kind of see a little bit of the live resin color absolutely beautiful this nice amber lightness i can't smell the terps i can't smell the terps through this right now but i definitely feel like it's gonna be a quality experience the strain that we're working with this is candy apple it is a sativa so all we do is put it right into here give it a couple twists it'll catch i did not over tighten it and now we're gonna rip it here we go one hit you y'all know the [ __ ] rules west coast will be tour baby so on this lower temperature you definitely get the best of the best when it comes to the terps it doesn't taste hot at all i can feel i feel like i'm taking a low temp dab and what's really cool about this particular product is the cured resin uh it is a flour based product i'm not sure in this case if they're using nug run or if they're using some trim or sugar trim or whatever the case is but the terps on this are very very noticeable uh you can taste every single bit of yup you can taste every single bit of the strain the candy apple it's sweet it's sour it's got this little bit of pineness to it and when you inhale it and exhale you get this nice earthiness like herby earthiness in the back of your mouth and so tastes just like weed it's fruity it's tasty it works second hit coming through let's go so again really consistent on the intake and the pull pushing the battery on this and ripping it extremely easy i like that there's various heat settings i think that's extremely important in the vape space you don't want a battery that has one consistent temperature distillate is best heated at a certain temperature live resin is best hit at a certain temperature i'm sure cure the resin is bested at a certain temperature at all various various boiling points various heating points so um i think overall between the vessel uh you know heating the heating the cartridge up and the cartridge performance you know i think we're having a very very high level premium experience the terps are shining uh i'm all very much already high i can feel my heart racing and my energy picking up um score out of 10 though i'm thinking cured resin you know it comes in that high chirping extract that vape space you know smell color taste potency you know the product appeal um i really enjoy the leaf works as a brand they've grown on me significantly significant quite quite a lot over the years to be honest they've made a significant improvement to what i believe is the coolness of their brand i think the product quality has always been there and this is a testament to that it's an incredible vape experience uh if you are used to buying a live resin cartridge or a sauce pen and you were to pick this up and it wasn't what you were normally buying you would not be disappointed with this and so because of that reason i 100 percent recommend it uh i like the presentation and the appeal i think this fits in with the washington market very well i'd like to see the terpene information on the back and some of the genetics information for the strain um i like the wall hangerness you know like you know for the hooks and and the shelf space in washington i could do without the sativa indica hybrids for those kinds of things but you know overall i think this is a for a cured resin high tripping extract um you know with the vessel here helping it out i think this is really close to a nine uh if not just a nine flat um you know read the full review i'll write up some of my notes and my full experience here and kind of share some more information on the article with respectmyregion.com but i think i'm going to settle in at a 9. i need some more terpene information i need some genetics information the candy apple is very much tasty the experience on this was very good highly recommended so let me know what you guys think in the comments give me some some of your thoughts make sure you go follow leafworks on instagram and all social medias of course respect my region too we got a lot of videos on the on the youtube right now so definitely go tap in this is jpeg here man coming at you guys live west coast weed tour review i got the vessel cured resin vape cart one gram high terpene extract make sure you guys go check it out in washington i'll see you guys down the road peace", "qSjD0xYbgpc": "Hey!
