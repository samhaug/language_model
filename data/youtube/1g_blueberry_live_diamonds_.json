{"IVzqJHvoURM": "[Music] please don't go all right what's up guys simplistic here back with another video we got buddies diamonds in today's video and honestly i didn't know it existed and another thing i like to mention is if you've seen yesterday's video i think i mentioned it stevie bought this before and he told me it tastes like vegetables and when i bought it and brought it into the car that's when he told me this was the one that tasted like vegetables he told me his current wax tasted like vegetables but i didn't know it was this one until i actually bought it and brought it in the car with me and uh yes i did kind of open it yesterday to show p2 peeps shout out to the homie i didn't smoke it but it definitely did smell like vegetables so i'm kind of like i'm kind of like what the [ __ ] you know so uh but it was 24 so 24 for diamonds i mean i guess i can i shouldn't expect much you know but we're just going to show you some of this on the phone headband crossfit field cookies and you got that diamond right there you see that that's the diamond and then you got all that stuff you got right here buddies and then right here even tells you the manufacturer but yeah pretty good stuff live resin all that stuff let's just open this i'll pick that up look at this [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] it looks good but it smells like vegetables that's it yeah hold on let me give austin a little whiff of it i hope it doesn't taste like it smells too much i mean obviously vegetables are good for you and [ __ ] but you know when when it comes to wax i kind of want it to taste not like vegetables you know i'm saying all right but uh we will be giving austin a hit as well to see if he likes this because uh you know another opinion is always good so he he actually said it smelled good so like a herbie what huh oh yeah there's cookies in there field cookies it's headband and field cookies all right let's try this we got the utility flame i'm actually at stevie's house right now we're gonna do a reaction video uh we actually tried to do it yesterday and uh that [ __ ] was too high so he's not smoking after until after uh tastes better than it smells all right actually it's not bad it's actually pretty refreshing i guess you can't judge a book by its smell the wax fights got him one you know how to hit it right so this is my boy austin i did do a video with him where he freestyled in the beginning it was a buddy's cartridge video and i'm saying press it again and hold it he's gonna take fat hits this is diamond so it's generally smoother on the lungs but very high uh lower in taste but higher in percentage of thc what was the taste i don't know fantastic tastes like burnt wax well let me pack more actually because that's probably so we'll pack them a fatter hit it's not bad 25 dollars for diamonds you really can't beat that so you can try it again how's that don't take a second after because it might be burnt just take the first hit so uh press it again and just take this hit and then don't take another one after because that's going to be the breakfast because you basically burnt all the wax already yeah how's it taste now tastes like a vegetable vegetable wax oh you got it of course you got it but how's that tastes pretty good well don't be a food reviewer it tastes pretty good no it tastes like herby kind of minty minty that's a good way to describe it yeah there we go okay there's the flavors so yeah stevie actually has one of those too i'm about to steal some little what so since you have this wax what would you say about it this buddy's headband um yeah that's a good way to minty minty herbie with a sweat slight sweetness and maybe like that cookie taste that you were saying earlier a little bit yeah i'm not really a cookie taste it smells like cookie though it smelled good when i walked in but [ __ ] oh my god [Music] all right guys uh that is going to be it for this yeah come over there looking ruining my video no i'm just kidding but uh hopefully you enjoyed the video it is like a slight minty herby taste with the slight sweetness and uh i don't know if i'm gonna get this again but definitely will be getting some more other diamond buddies strains you know i'm saying i wasn't really too big of a fan of this but it's not bad other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] please don't go you're the only one that i had [Music] you", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily you guys do it all the time man when i don't ask you guys to smash that like button you guys are over here hitting 400 500 likes so i know this one time that your boy asked you for a like we could run it up to over 600 right boys and once we get that i'm gonna go ahead and go out and cop my favorite cartridges of 2020 put you guys on game all right boys so with that being said let's go ahead and narrow this down buddy's cartridge fire um you know i'm sad that it kind of took me so long to hop on this buddy's wave you know i was just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be definitely copying these a lot more copying the earth is a lot more i want to try a 710 um pod again uh tier one possibly and just see how how that gets me i could already like imagine dude just how fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would be the nine out of ten for me so um yeah we're ending out the video here if you guys enjoyed today's man video do me one last favor let's smash that like button let's get over

something really special this is a new product that i bought um it's called bud diamonds this is an ice water live rosin this stuff's amazing um i had one dab of it and it is the best tasting stuff i've ever had in my life quite literally it smells just like blueberries this is the blueberry cheesecake i wish i really wish you could smell it um this stuff is sullivantless there are no chemicals in it that's why it tastes so so good um the way this is made is you take a a marijuana plant when it is ready to be harvested you cut it down and you freeze it for a little while you take that frozen bud you put it in ice water you use 5 gallon buckets they make these micron bags there's different levels of filtration so you can get really really fine quality um so anyways back to it they basically they take the frozen bud and they wash it wash it in ice water and all of the good stuff falls off all the trichomes fall off and so that's basically what's left in the bottom of the bag so they will take the bottom of the bag and scrape it and they will let it dry out and then they will take it and they will press it with heat and that is what this is this is called ice water live rosin so it's really really pretty it's a white it smells absolutely amazing just like blueberries oh my gosh um this stuff is quite expensive because it takes so much plant matter to make this um yeah it's not cheap but it's really good it's a special treat so i'm gonna put you guys on hold for just a second and i'm gonna heat a banger up and we're gonna have a dab so right back all right you guys so you can see the banger is hot i've set a timer for 50 seconds i love the mj rigs they're small i have a couple of them the atlas and the hydra this one's a true recycler one watch the function on it i actually have a nice hefty little dab here we've got about 20 seconds to go watch the function on this and the function on this one i love these rigs all right so we're just about ready to go here so excited wow wow that tastes just like candy i had to stop for a second because wow um i coughed just a little bit that was a huge dab for me delicious oh my gosh no wonder the stuff is so expensive to make um sullivantless i hardly coughed and that was a huge dab um yeah bud diamonds you're doing a good stuff here good good i seriously would have to say this is the best thing i've ever tasted literally um with a properly timed dab these oh my gosh tastes just like candy okay all right guys well i don't know what else to say other than that was freaking delicious and i can't wait to have another one um thank you for watching if you enjoy these kind of videos please please consider subscribing give me thumbs up i really enjoy doing these kind of videos i do work in a dispensary so a

diamonds and sauce review right now on the strain show answers to all the questions you've ever had about weeds today we're gonna do a review of this gelato cake live diamonds and sauce from Vince got the fancy iPhone again to take some close-up shots so let's see what this stuff looks like here's the box we got seventy seven point six seven percent THC and the packaging just looks really awesome I love these boxes and I love all the graphics on them the box from last week looks awesome that's last week's review don't forget to check that out I even got this Vince key dad now well it's really like a mousepad but I'm using it as a dad mat right now I really love their branding I really love their hash - let's see what this stuff looks like whoo Oh God look at this I mean it's it's so wet and it's like poured up the side a little bit you see that there's a nice mix of diamonds and sauce look at this that's sort of a bummer I got some stuff to the lid but that's okay we'll get it later oh this stuff has such a deep musky scent oh oh I don't know what that smells like but it smells so good it smells like um definitely like an indica like a cushy Diesel II earthy type of oh I wish you could smell this oh god it smells so good alright I know it's smelling let's do some Davin let's see how much of this wet stuff we can balance on here while we heat up the banger and get all this off the side might as well get that chunky crystal straight diamonds how wet it is oh the terms dude I mean that looks like a pretty dangerous amount that dab really wants to drip off with that so bad please don't little buddy please we'll just make it oh my god it's barely hanging up okay maybe I can set up the camera phone the camera phone will heat up your dad at the same time okay okay what's the name of this phone this iPhone 11 Pro max it's really cool for close-up stuff I like using it for a number two camera yes bonus fire it takes really really sick close-up multi-shot zap ash yes I want one of your best hashed filming phones please all right here we go buddy it's a lot okay strange Oh [Music] they're nice that was a smooth smooth dab so super smooth and it tasted exactly like it smells unless we need to put a word to this smell it's a I mean what would I call this taste alone I don't have a word for it yet I'm gonna hit another down and we're gonna decide the taste but it tastes like a very indica dominant earthy pungent musky a robust it tastes like Mother Nature's tittie nipple if you sucked on it well you gotta figure out some better descriptive terms than that we need to hit another dab the store still sucks but I raised the phone camera so we don't got to do this awkward bending over on the counter I hit a dab stuff cuz that was mad weird I don't know if you've seen the weirdness in it but I felt it I felt the weird and it wasn't the kind of weird I like to feel gonna see Jade cicada tonight you don't know Jade cicada I will leave a link to his music you need to check that out too gelato cake live diamonds and sauce strange oh yeah just going hidden over and over and over again it's never-ending dab stopper whoa I think mother nature's tittie nipple think I still like that because there's so many earthy elements that I could use to describe this super weird super good never tasted any anything that isn't a weed product that tastes anything like this like the world don't taste like this unless you're smoking weed but if you lived your whole life and never spoke no dank weed and then you just walked into a dispensary and got blooming SuperDuper gumdrop gelato cake and all these fruity exotic strains you're gonna start tasting things you've never tasted in your whole life like that yeah that's what this what we taste like okay Oh weed if you know someone that doesn't smoke weed serving this videos and tell them show them you see his excitement do you see how excited because of how these dabs taste live resin man live resin is pretty much like a whole a live weed plant if you don't know how they make live resin I got a little video about that it's pretty interesting stuff but all right that's the - dabs in we're gonna piece it out for 20 minutes and I'll be right back to let you know how the high from this stuff is so it's been about 23 minutes I feel good in stone after I hit those dabs I had this head that heavy chest feeling I had that for probably half the time I've been gone for the whole 10 minutes still feeling like I might cough I mean this stuff although it hits real smooth it's like it reaches in and grabs you and just remember on Game of Thrones or that giant crush that little girl oh that's what this did to me for ten minutes but in the best way possible that it could do that I wouldn't matter at all I wasn't in pain I know it wasn't not enjoying myself but I was just like felt like I was gonna bust a little drop a sweat Vince Clive revs and diamonds and sauce it's a lot okay I'm gonna give this like a nine point five out of ten very good if you remember I only paid two dollars for both of these we're not even gonna judge on price because the price was awesome yeah check out the video from the honey number for live diamonds review and you can see how I ended up getting both of these guys or two bugs and so I highly recommend this stuff I don't know about Alec Colorado but here in Colorado this brand Vince carb in ski how do you say this everybody I know says it a different way I think I'm like Vince key better but if it's been Skyy want to know I don't want to be saying the

courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm

a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "8dwXxPhpoSM": "what's up everyone this is wengie smokes I'm back again with another episode I just got back from my

did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove",

total cannabinoids we're working with a hybrid strain here and uh two percent cbd in this one 82 thc so uh yeah pretty nice pretty nice stats there for the cannabinoids we've got we're working with a 7.45 percent terp profile uh here's the back for you guys so you can read that come on focus and there we go yeah i'll be sure to leave the two uh profiles up in the video as well uh but yeah so this is uh our third buddies cartridge that you've seen on the channel our second liquid diamonds one and um you know let's just get this started the same way we always do with a hit and you know i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting and other notes that i have i guess so everyone please pack your bowl pack your dabs get your pen ready all that good stuff you know the drill guys cheers [Music] oh all right so getting kind of a little little little hint of sour notes in there um hmm it's not too too heavy on the sourness i guess you know i'm not getting a tang there nothing to make me like pucker my lips or anything either but there is a sour flavor but i'm also getting a kind of doughy and creamy creaminess to it too uh the flavor here is a little bit uh reminiscent to the oreo cream uh like cured resin cartridge i had from friendly farms but obviously different so it's similar in that kind of creamy creamy taste that it has and uh very interesting because uh compared to the banjo cart that we've had guys on the channel which was a i believe a sativa it was a lot more like it had a lot more tanginess and souriness than this does you know more like a it stood out more you know the pioneering stood out or not the piney the lima needs to sit out a little bit more um in this one limonene is only about 1.36 so uh you know that might be a reason why but we also get a little bit of the sweet tones um and um yeah i'm not picking up too much else outside of that but let me go ahead and take another hit for you guys here and yeah cheers okay now i'm trying to pick up more of that uh that tank but it's still very very subtle so one thing i'll say about this as well is it's a little bit darker in color than the other buddies cartridge we've had let me see if that will focus up on the camera please yeah it's a little bit darker in color um and uh then the banjo liquid diamonds but obviously that might you know that's going to vary between batches and strains but um it's just about the right color i'd expect for a live resin cartridge and it's very smooth i really like how smooth all the buddies liquid diamonds eyebrows and cartridges have been for me uh you know i've heard some people have some negative things to say about the buddies cartridges i for one in my personal experience have nothing bad to say so uh you know that's where it is but um this definitely one of my favorite cartridge brands this may not be my favorite strain pickup or whatever you know what have you but it's surprisingly good you know i wasn't expecting much out of this train in the first place so uh being satisfied with it is good enough for me and um yeah so let's rather that's all i've got to say about this cartridge so far i do think you guys should check this one out as well buddies make some very very good stuff and you know this new york city diesel is definitely one of those things so let's take one more hit for you guys here i hope you guys will join me for this last one in the video so cheers you know this may not be a flavor profile for me but i still do think that it's very tasty i definitely prefer the banjo but this is still tasty in its own right well that's all i have for you guys in this one i hope you guys tune in for the cartridge comp that is coming very soon and i want to say a big thank you to everyone who's been watching so far uh you know the

with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "jkVPK8g6HlM": "live resin is my favorite kind of concentrate and i love how most of it has these crazy huge diamonds in it that looks so sick but what is it i'm about to tell you what these diamonds are how they get there and why they're only in live resin right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed these chunks in live resin sometimes called live diamonds or diamonds and sauce are just straight up chunks of thc and the runny part are the sauce is a collection of mad terpenes and cannabinoids and this is why i love live resin so much i even made some live resin gear for the strange show shop just so i would have a sick hoodie to wear i mean live resin is just the perfect combination of the runny smelly terpenes i want plus a bunch of chunks of thc that sounds perfect to me speaking of me my name's matt this is the strain show and this is the channel where i answer all the questions you ever had about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain branch so almost all weed concentrates except for things like cbd extracts have thc in them but you usually only see these diamonds in live resin and not even all live resin has these diamonds so what's going on here what's the difference why are these thc diamonds only in live resin and how do these diamonds even form in the first place well that all has to do with how live resin is made with most weed concentrates all of the weed that you use has been dried first like all of the weed i hung in this humongous drying room but with live resin the weed that is used is cut down quickly stripped of all its fan leaves and frozen as quickly as possible like in these big bags of frozen weed i have right here when the weed is quickly frozen instead of being allowed to dry it retains almost all of the terpenes and cannabinoids of the living weed plant hence the name live resin the terpenes that give your weed all of its smell and that give your hash all of its flavor are liquids and when you dry the wheat out you lose most of your terpenes and most of your flavor but with live resin you keep all of that but that only tells us why live resin tastes so good but what does that have to do with these diamonds forming well i was wondering the same thing and luckily i have friends in very high places so i reached out to some friends over at viola extracts here in denver where they make awesome concentrates and they're always pushing out some fire live resin and i ask them for an expert's explanation of how all these extra terps and stuff make these thc diamonds form in something like live resin but they don't form in something like shatter and here's what they told me the crystalline formations are dictated by the volatility of the source material the more volatile the source material like fresh frozen weed will produce a more dynamic chemical reaction under purge resulting in the separation and formation of crystalline structures a less volatile source product like dried weed produces less of a dynamic reaction and stabilizes before attaining crystalline structures thus the solid homogenous structure of shatter so basically the oil that is extracted from these live plants starts off without these diamonds in it but this oil is made up of so many different compounds that there are all kinds of different chemical reactions going on between different parts of the plant while all this is going on and the extraction solvents are being purged off tiny crystalline structures of thc begin to form and sink and eventually they stick together and form these huge thc diamonds and sometimes they grow huge like this monster here in the oils extracted from dried weed there aren't as many components or chemical reactions and the thc never separates and forms these crystalline structures and that's why shatter is just hard and dry it was made from dried weed that has way less terpenes in cannabinoids to cause those chemical reactions and crystalline formations and now that i know all about what these thc diamonds are i'm about to go right here and hit some fat slow-mo dabs of these guys and that's the video i think you should watch right now this is the video that youtube thinks you should watch right now so i don't know you tell me but yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got these nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange

i can't even use [ __ ] squeegees around this [ __ ] whoa that's so satisfying three days later we have the prism pineapple skunk live crystals uh on their website it is only saying 85 thc uh coming in 94. i've got some cbga the cbg really helps my back uh i know there's really not going to be any taste to this but i've never had their diamonds so i had to grab them then there's only one more which would be agricon uh and after that i'm chilling on the diamonds so here we go let's bust this baby open i've been waiting see they glued herself down nice can't be tampered with what is that nice oh damn it i didn't want to do that i like saving making the boxes nice but it is worth it it's not like it was 100 or something okay here we go i'm loving this new box color too oh it sounds like one huge chunk oh definitely sounds like a big chunk but pineapples got it live crystals from prism let's see here we go [Music] that one is a chunk there's two nice chunks in there and then a lot of like diamond shape which i mean that ain't bad let me take the light off yeah looking pretty good almost like a slushie uh they're probably gonna be softer diamonds uh let me show you these these i got a couple days ago um the prism i mean prime uh afghan tie diamonds and look at these though real quick how nice these are omg there was more but there was like three big nice slaps but you guys see in that video we're on this one here it might have more taste than i think they look a lot wetter than uh i thought they were gonna be uh the smell um definitely i can smell him from here but uh spinning his camera around love this baby up and driving give it a smell test real quick oh it has a good good terpene pineapple smell i think this is that one chunk is huge i really think this is gonna be good i think it's gonna have a taste more than uh i thought but let's try it out okay look at that look at that one i don't know if it's gonna break up into a bunch of pieces or look at that that's dope such a nice smell to it uh yeah this is almost like a sugar over here what like a hundred dollars though it was a hundred dollars for this 100 dang dollars which is ridiculous but i mean it does look nice kind of almost looks like prime for real that nice clear sugary wax load this baby up oh yeah nice power we're gonna try uh just probably gonna melt down like some nice ice cubes look at that i mean that is some nice sugar nice clear and definitely i'm glad it has a taste for it well i can't say that yet but i'm thinking there's going to be more taste to these than the grass roots but here we go i was like one minute and a half my eyes are watering my nose is starting to run getting the sweats it's really kicking in now and it definitely has a taste way more than ah g leaves diamonds grass roots diamonds i've never had primes just diamonds but they're diamonds and sauce it's freaking amazing which i thought this is going to be all diamonds in that sauce and again i'm very very happy to whew wow burns up clear it don't burn up too black i am lit i can just fill it don't say uh anywhere on the box uh about it being a hybrid sativa indica a lot of these companies ain't been putting that on there which kind of drives me nuts a couple of them not a lot but uh that's why i do like uh pharmaceutics because they give you everything that's in there and uh this video will be coming out real soon too but yeah uh i'm thinking it's definitely a hybrid [Music] okay overall are they worth a hundred dollars no but they definitely highly medicate you uh help my back pain uh get me motivated right now to go do something and uh you guys rock make sure that subscribe like ring that bell love you guys have a good", "JP6nAtU3z2c": "[Music] what is up guys p2 peeps back with another video and this time we're redoing one i might include the footage the failed footage uh earlier or in this video but yeah so i did have a video recorded of this review for the uh buddies liquid diamonds live resin banjo strain review um i did like a whole one outside audio quality was really bad because of the wind and um you know i had it all edited and cut up and then i watched it over again and i was like you know what this this audio quality is so far below standard i don't feel like i should upload it even though the video looks great so we're doing you know a redo so yeah you guys know how we do our cars reviews here before we uh get into anything we take a hit together so everyone at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready all that good stuff because uh you know you know the initial tastes and flavors like how we always do so cheers everybody and the flavor on this thing is impeccable i know you guys know how i feel about it for those of you who have been on stream because this isn't the first time we've seen this cart on the channel you know i did do a live unboxing and first impressions and then i did a live comparison and review between this and the distillate cart the uh legendo g and watermelon skittles cart so sorry just had to take a quick deep breath there and um yeah let's get into how we're feeling on the flavors here it's a very very nice sweet citrusy tone uh pretty much throughout the throughout the whole way you know um i have had banjo as a strained in flour a few times and i wouldn't i was never able to really uh taste this deep of citrus flavor so i really really like that about this cartridge it's got a very nice you know very necessity suite and i love that you know i'm a big sucker for oranges so you know citrusy sweet is very reminiscent of oranges so yeah another good thing i like about buddies cars just as a general thing to say they have the terpene profiles on the back of every box and i feel like that should be included for like pretty much all uh live resin or just any uh you know cartridge that has terpenes in it you know if you're gonna flex that you've got some terpenes in there let's see the breakdown too you know but yeah i really really like the sweetness to this there's no tang to it really but uh it does have a really nice coating coating flavor you know you get you feel a lot of the flavor after the initial taste like in this back area of your mouth you know the very back and kind of the roofs of the mouth as well almost like you bit into a very sweet fruit you know how the the taste kind of lingers there so yeah let's uh take one more hit here to uh see if we can find anything different i mean you guys already know i'm kind of you know thoroughly testing this one it's about half the way through but yeah so you guys know the drill get that bowl ready get your dab ready get that pen out because we're about to get hit cheers everybody okay so i get also a nice uh gassy piney-ness there too at the very start very very nice there yeah you know this is very deep terps on it i'm very impressed with just buddy's products in general you know i was really really satisfied with their uh cannabis drive terpenes cart and i'm even more satisfied with this liquid diamonds car you know i don't think i've had any other liquid diamond live resin cards out there i'm not sure what the difference is between a liquid diamond left resin cart and a regular live resin cart is but if that's something you guys would like me to figure out find out and all that good stuff then i'll be happy to do that but yeah that should about wrap it up for this video um my final thoughts on this cartridge is that you should try it i think this banter as someone who's not a sativa fan and banjo is a sativa strain this is excellent down to its you know effect you know i'm feeling real good right now and i still have euphoria all that all that good stuff it's a really really worth it cart and you know for those of you who aren't there for my comparison between the distillate and the live resin uh buddies cartridges just know that we'll we will be having a cartridge comparisons episode for that yeah thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed you know the drill like comment subscribe all that good stuff uh it's great seeing you guys out there and i hope to see some of you in the live stream sometimes p2 out peace", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "Mo-0RNiK4Fw": "what's good everybody Sacramento Deborah your for exclusive care and today I'm reviewing the blueberry cheesecake by Ola I just walked into a Marie Callender's smells like vanilla berries and wine to me hmm Wow even sweeter on the flavor than it is in the smell definitely taste blueberries it definitely tastes a little bit of cheese it's got some floral hints a little bit of just a tiny bit of citrus I'm gonna take another hit of that stuff it's even better the second time around I can just go back and forward in time to relive that hit over and over again I would", "j4CcpqgcBVQ": "[Music] okay [Music] foreign [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another buddies cartridge video and uh if you didn't see that beginning clip that was the homie austin you know doing his thing you know a little freestyle it's good to plug in the homie once in a while but um another thing is they're actually still doing it right there but i figured i'd do a review while i'm here you know i'm saying so i could show them or at least give them a hit so but yes this is the peach flame flambe peach flambe crossed with pineapple upside down cake and why i got this is because as you can see right here you can zoom in if it's not focusing okay it's 13 terps and that is the highest i've seen when it came when it comes to a buddy's cartridge so um i haven't tried all the buddies cartridges so i don't know if this is the highest testing but to my knowledge the uh out of all the ones i've tried so far this is the highest percentage i've seen so i'm definitely interested and excited to open this and try this so let me know if you tried this this is definitely a long name too like i didn't even [ __ ] care to name it they were just like peach flambe [ __ ] upside down cake so whoa [Music] really good usually with these ones it's a little bit darker i mean look on the cover right what the [ __ ] that's a good thing right no it's not i don't know [Music] i don't know guys i don't know but we'll try i gotta i got the nug still right here as you can see put that in here don't get it dirty stand it up so also i'd like to give a shout out to ben or be legit for always you know insane helping out he will be taking a hit of this even though he's high so damn that tastes pretty exotic okay it's not quite like any live resin i've tried before honestly it's like wow it's like a lightness to it but it's [ __ ] flavorful at the same time it's almost like um oh yeah he has a better palette let me let's let's hear what he's going to describe to taste that it really tastes like tea to me tea like a sweet tea [Music] all right let's just see what the the highest uh tert profile it is b cara cara filling with lemon lean at three percent as well and it's uh i i forgot i didn't mention the manufacturer date and all that is uh 8 11 20. so it tastes like tea to you mm-hmm i'm gonna try it again hey nikki come out here hit this for me let's see how it tastes we got my homie nicky as well aka ben's cousin but we got the hum [Music] let us know how this tastes i feel like this is a kind of it has like a burning sensation that this lit does give off but it's very terpy i don't know i'm guessing i could it could also mean that maybe all the more tastes like yeah it more tastes like weed yeah the 13 terps maybe made it lighter is what i'm assuming um but austin come out here give him that do that get that get away from me with it your mouth [Music] tastes good that's it that's all you gotta tell me what it tastes good it tastes all right tastes all right okay well his his taste is kind of distorted from the the smoke he's actually getting from the backwoods so his taste buds aren't all there i'm laying on that black i swear you smoke something and then you do a dab it's not gonna taste the same yeah so uh but yeah i i really enjoy this uh i did buy this at finos i usually buy it on authentic for 32.50 but i bought this here for 35 out the door and honestly like i'm kind of sick of the the strains that they had at authentic so it was dope that i seen new strains at fino so if you guys are interested in more buddies strains like i am and you are located in the 209 area you know i'd suggest going to finos as well because i honestly didn't know that they had it uh any final thoughts on the cartridge itself ben how much was it 35 35. i'd say there's better options out there for 35 right yeah no no really they're distillate well yeah like taste wise not even well taste wise distillate is a lower quality when it comes to oil because it's not all the original plant is mostly not there right yeah but i mean they could taste better because they could taste like strawberry or some [ __ ] that you like i don't know it's not going to be as strong as what i'm saying yeah i usually don't buy carts yeah i don't even know why i asked for your opinion but yes i really do enjoy it i'm i'm a little bit thrown off by the color of this oil but uh nonetheless still pretty good so if you like the video if you like the videos like it i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned um but yes if you liked the video please give me a thumbs up subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out after all arms this hurts you know tell me that this isn't for sure [Music]", "ZTQ2relAb6E": "was a good job i don't know how to fix that [

justin from edmond and buddy's brand acai gelato live resin dab so i'm pretty excited to check this out we've uh previously taken some photos with this so this is kind of what we're looking like in terms of the extract nice solid herby gelato-y smell there's a quick review for you guys um justin here i'm going to serve you up a low temp dab if that's cool let me get a quick scoop out oh wow look at this consistency on the diamonds wow pretty beautiful i'll show you guys what we'll see nice big chunky diamond there all right there we go and then i have a quick little heating method here come to five one two three four and five and then that's gonna move there we go one two three bam all right brother go ahead and let me know what you think so taste test review you all please subscribe we've got the new playlist here we're going to be reviewing as many of these dabs and products as we can give you guys a good idea of the terps the flavor the high etc justin what are you feeling and tasting in terms of the terps and the high over your body right now on the eyes it's really nice and sedated on the body i love gelato you know july is my favorite stream it's got that really nice body like creep in them tastes really good though body high solid flavor is it accurate for a gelato profile we're looking we're looking at beta-carotelline 4.73 percent alpha-humaline 0.76 limiting at 0.47 so are you getting citrus are you getting spicy earthy are you getting a woody musk more than winning most okay more of that interesting manufactured september 14th not exactly super fresh but it is the sativa coming in at total cannabinoids 84.71 uh big shout out to buddy's brand one uh they do the terpenes on the back so that's super super helpful and informative um it is just cannabis concentrate again just some live resin diamonds and do you feel like here i'll give you a less quick smell do you feel like between the smell and the flavor do you feel like you got an accurate flavor profile and if so what would you give this taste test review in terms of a sport in terms of taste definitely maybe a 9 for sure i love the aftertaste for sure i love the fact that with gelatos you can really get that floral essence after you hit it whether it's right after a couple seconds later yep it really has to do with the terpene profile in fact that's all displayed here love that as well that all goes into account when you especially when you're taking dabs you really dab for the taste especially doing low temp dabs like we did still a fat dab and i could definitely still feel like myself like i said this is still kicking in into sativa so you should feel some waves of energy yeah it's like various types of highs you know how you have you ever had like a kush very cheesecake yeah or that uh that floral vibe but like you said still more a little cerebral but a little bit of body as well mm-hmm i can really get that as a nice deep so nine out of ten final sports for sure appreciate you on that brother well justin here thank you my man for coming through buddy's brand the acai gelato coming in with a nine flat on the official taste test review please be sure to tune in

"Du1I1PZbEFQ": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video hit up rise again had to I was running low I tore up through that diamonds through the legend of 91 that I had that's pretty good have last a couple days and how to grab something else so I grabbed some diamonds and sauce Malawi memory loss number-one diamonds and sauce 96% THC a I will crunch the numbers for you down in the comment sections and you can see what it is right there prime allowing memory loss this is a sativa stuff let's get it open I got my dab tool here I got my rig got all my stuff lighter we're all set to go let's get this bad boy open and we'll see what the Diamonds and soaps now I have had a few diamonds and sauce before but I had that scarlet fire diamonds and sauce yeah I put these little seals on here that are popping off this one came off rainy it's supposed to be on here I think like that Prime has been but the cat went took the cap off the cap kind of rips it off mmm and then there it is the diamonds I should move them around a little bit so you could see them better to kinda looks like really just diamonds I mean if some sauce in there there looks a lot like diamonds one just fell out holy cow that's a huge chunk whoa wait you see the size of this diamond that fell out it's in my hand right there it's huge fell out the jar so we won't do that again we'll try to tilt the camera yeah fell right out like he was a big chunk you guys witnessed the whole thing there is the Diamonds of our memory loss diamonds I want to fall out the jar mr. Mullaly memory loss diamonds see that one fell out I was crazy if things fell right out and popped on my table it was a big chunk two big old diamond you see when did it on my tool and I can show you which one it was [Music] that's the piece that fell out right there well that's a chunk that's probably about four or five hits so we're not gonna have to break it up a little bit the dinosaur this thing it's mostly diamonds though it's not too much saucy there goes a couple little pieces that stuck on there there so we'll have to hit right there that's how I do it then I'll put a head on this tool this other tool and you throw a little diamond on there so probably have to break some of those up there's are kind of big chunks trying to make this last a little bit you know I don't to go through it like I did that other one yeah I'm gonna break this up a little bit get a couple dabs on each tool that might be the one just one huge one I'll do a couple little ones just one one big dab right there that I'm gonna do on the tool will do that dime in there I had a little one on the other one then this one will do a little one on this one too hard man the heart is a rock and I'll put a little one on there too that's a medium sized dad that one I think three three or four should be the magic number it's 96 percent done nice smell to it but as you know the higher a percentage you get in your waxes or butters or diamonds the less flavor yeah ask anybody so that's why it doesn't have a real huge terpene profile you can see zooming in so you get a better view of the terpene profile yeah let me get a dab of this I'll do these three down do one or two maybe on camera and then I'll do the other one or two probably off camera yeah let's give it a shot it's Malawi memory loss sativa the THC a is ninety six point two five for the THC is five five eight nine five thirty nine car for me to see up close my contacts in yeah I'll crunch the numbers for you it's probably going to be up there if I crunch the numbers right now I can't do it on my calculator as a user that's my timer also yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know if you've had this malawi memory loss diamonds and sauce you've tried it i had it before and a butter i think maybe I hadn't allowing memory loss before he even did a video about it I like to get my my ring I hit the rig red-hot okay some people have asked me and to burn off any excess but it does burn up a lot of fuel I go through canisters pretty quick because I like to burn off any excess and get it red hot when I get it red hot that I know for sure forty forty five seconds it's ready to go everytime like money magic it's right on it you know what I mean it's perfect timing so get it red hot gets red a little bit then I know that if I wait forty seconds and dab it's perfect [Music] people do it different ways so I do it that'll be ready I think I'll do that big one first I'll go with this chunker here big dab there Malawi memory loss this was packaged on O 115 it says January 15th ten doses per gram yeah diamonds and sauce strong stuff cheers to the malawi memory loss Dinah's a sauce [Music] nice very nice taste it's got a nice taste but I can't put my finger on it's got a lot a little bit of everything if you look at the profile it's got a lot of everything a little bit the most prominent the highest would be thing might be mersin and car I can't even save there maybe you'll be able to see it yeah see it doesn't have a big there are not Lots amount of terpene profile because they say the higher the percentage THC of course you're gonna get less flavor that one here let me do one more for you on camera then I'll do the other two yeah they come with these little plastic things across the top of the jars now that's a new feature I never seen that before on Prime had the last one I bought the legendre 91 had this little this little it's almost like a food product you know I did rip the something off the top of like a mayonnaise jar or something pretty cool made me it probably keeps it fresher you know or better they should have been doing that same with the flower they should all have some kind of Evita packs a moisture packs in my opinion to another dab of this Malawi memory loss sativa deco my sativas did some of that cerebral going on today yeah my Niners lost last Sunday it's a good game got a few bad calls that didn't go our way too wet toward KC's way but it is what it is and they'll be back next year good game though superboy hats kind of sucked usually they're you know like they're really good this year I did I think they were too good the best one was that the Rito's one with the cowboy little nas X and the hole dude from Roadhouse off-topic sorry about that you know I go on my tangents sometimes set my timer yeah you do this other one here next dad not too big nice diamond on there boom happy Sunday said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section we remember loss number one so phenotype it's said of just didn't say it on here but it said it on a menu that was watermelon phenotype they said yeah Cheers diamonds and sauce although it look like mostly just diamonds [Music] that should have my carb cap with me very tasty let me show you that again Wow a memory loss diamonds and sauce and you see in there bright inside there we've never lost diamonds and the sauce there's a lot of sauce it's mostly just died on us as you can see all right we'll make the video too long I already did make it made it wait longer than I usually do I apologize now you should try to keep them under 10 minutes this one's already had 14 so yeah diamonds a sauce mmm pretty good I might throw a 4th one on there you know 4 is my magic number 4 dabs of dooya all right I'm gonna let you go I'm Alex I'm out laval a memory loss diamonds and sauce sativa it's probably going to be really good they always are Prime has been a pretty good lately now they're putting these new little plastic seals across the top which I just do in the ashtray there's little white pieces of a paper maybe of help with the freshness and stuff like that but yeah alright peace I'm out", "Ew-XRTsElgI": "hey hey you guys it's your favorite little keto goofball diamond and today is day 1263 of my ketogenic journey going from 311

"-qAxAkedoD8": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video you know it's Friday so I had a hit a prize today grab a little Sun and today I grabbed blueberry headband by rythm cured sugar I wasn't even gonna do a review today but I decided to do a review because I got inspired by a subscriber I met in line today shoutout to the guy on the NASA jacket very cool you inspired me to make a video today blueberry headband I did have this before it is really good that's why I wasn't sure if I was going to make a video it is a second look at the blueberry headband by rhythm because I did have this before a few times very good stuff cured sugar got my rig ready to go let me know what you guys are smoking on on this Friday here in Erie on this Co vid 19 shut down this is darker and most stuff to cured sugar seems like it's always darker now I did have the jack herer in this before also have nice smell to it this is the cured sugar blueberry headband cured sugar looks dark in the jar see but it's not that dark when you pull it out it's like a real amber brown but yeah it's very good tasty and very good that is cured sugar by rhythm blueberry headband is the strain let's get a couple dabs on this it's a little bit hard to manage because it is sticky it's like the textures like that of like tree sap I would say but it is very good all right when you get a DAB on another tool in the highlight to put a couple of dabs on a couple of different tools this one's on the side loop there on the side some blueberry headband cured sugar get a couple of dabs of this I said I had this before it's very good very tasty and as a hybrid and it is uh and you like this torch up and I'll get you on there so hybrid the THC is I think it's 73% total cannabinoids are 93.2 is the total cannabinoids it has 3.2 THC an 80 point to THC a and when you crunch the numbers it's right about 73 percent THC which is pretty good though it seems like Terps are three point one percent you know look at that here see that at 73 percent THC blueberry headband by rhythm them you know nice little box the jar says rhythm on the cap yeah timer ready said let me know what you guys are smoking on on this Saturday or just Friday here it's only Friday it's not Saturday it just came back from the dispensary and you take my jacket off yet mmm we're cold in here 40 seconds and you do a DAB yeah blueberry headband cured sugar hybrid suits the most prominent terpene is with a point floor there's got to be Marcin that's not much of that either no peony is point for Marcin is 0.3 0.6 or penalty yes that's the potent one yeah we'll see Cheers blueberry headband cured sugar let er rip [Music] [Music] tasty you taste that Mersin a little bit but it's mixed good with the peony so it's kind like a piney Mersin tastes better than just a plain marcin tastes very good dog they said I bought this like three or four times I did a review on this before it's very good stuff blueberry headband cured sugar by rhythm rhythm is really good stuff up there with Moxie and farm rx is up there too with really good but once their prices come down a little bit I'll probably grab more of that stuff yeah I'm gonna do another dab of this blueberry headband and yeah it's a thumbs up for me and like I said I bought it a few times so you guys know it's a thumbs up if I bought it for four I think this is a fifth time I bought this and I did a review on this before of the blueberry headband so this is a second look and like I said I wasn't even gonna do a review today but I got inspired by a subscriber in line who asked me if I was going to do a review on the products that I bought today and I was like yeah maybe maybe not then I decided to do it so thanks again guy in an acid jacket alright peace blueberry headband cured sugar I'm out", "21yp9A9wxr4": "[Music] p2pt what's good y'all p2 peeps here and today we're going to be taking a look at the buddies distillate with cannabis rep terpenes sorry i almost forgot what we were doing but yeah uh the other day i opened this on stream um and i was you know i was really hoping to save the opening of this for a video but you know couldn't help everyone's saying try it out on stream and um honestly zero regrets i've been looking for buddies for so long and i'm just i'm just super super satisfied with the way this this hit this this turned out like like i'll tell you guys right now i've been looking for buddies a buddy's car for like four months now i saw it first on a simplistic youtube channel and i was like whoa this looks crazy like i'm not big on distillates uh some of you guys know that some of you guys don't i kind of quit cartridges for the first time or the first time i started trying cartridges i quit because i didn't really like distillates and i had no idea what live resin or cured resin was at the time and so now that i know what live resin and cute resin is i've gotten more into cartridges and since i've gone back into cartridges got back into this lids so without further ado let's take our hit of this and i'll discuss you know what we normally discuss the flavors and you know what i'm feeling about it so everyone out there at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready open your bag of chips whatever it is get your your water i don't know we're all just gonna you know cheers together and yeah so cheers boys for a distillate the flavor and that is impeccable like i'm really impressed with this buddies card stuff like before i tried this right you guys were able to see on the channel i was able to try another canon striped terpenes type cart it was a stizzy pot the i tried the grape sorbet and the super glue silver lines dizzy pods and the one thing i'll say about them in comparison to this buddies is that they don't have like they don't hold a candle they don't hold a candle of this i've only had one this is my very first buddies i'm not even done not even done with it and already i can tell you guys that this is much better than the stizzy derived cannabis terpene or stizzy cannabis derived terpenes line um and this is my honest opinion guys like i was expecting so much more when i um got the cannabis to drive terpenes pods from stizzy i was expecting so much more i spent like 70 bucks per gram 70 75 bucks per gram for them and um it just was it just didn't didn't hit as hard as i thought it would you know i wasn't expecting it to knock me out like a [ __ ] truck or anything like that right but i was expecting the flavor to be very very very very nice like there were a lot of people who were telling me like it's comparable to live resin carts which i thought was a stretch i think that's a stretch in in any in most regards like even even this distillate with cannabis derivatives this doesn't this doesn't really hold a candle to the flavor that you can get from eyebrows and cartridges right but this is still very very good yeah i get a lot of sweetness tones or sweet tones from this you know tiny little bit of tartness and there a little bit of sour um and pininess yeah so another good thing about buddies cards is that on the back of their packaging they've got the terpene profile right there for you so you know maybe not ex exactly you kind of know exactly what flavors you'll get with just looking at the back of this so the back of this right we've got ter profile 2.61 limonene 1.25 percent limonene is a terpene that is responsible for that lemony citrusy flavor um a mirror scene i think if i'm if i'm remembering this correctly i will correct myself later but mirror scene is the sweet stuff that's the generalized okay just i'm generalizing and pining the piney stuff so all that pine soul whatever piney taste that i've been talking about that's that's actual stuff yeah so that's that's what the most i can say about this you know buddies card so far i like it it's got great flavor it's better so far in terms of flavor and effect than the cannabis drive terpene pods from sizzy so yeah let's take another hit of this and um see if i can find anything different in terms of its flavor for you guys so yeah cheers everybody that pininess really sticks out in the uh the initial taste i didn't really comment too much about that but yeah i think it starts again nice piney lemony citrusy kind of flavor and then it finishes off with some very nice sweet tartness which is kind of like a candy really really nice so yeah i highly recommend you guys try a buddy's distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived or distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived terpenes cartridge this this stuff is really good sorry i'm kind of big like i can't even speak properly it's it's already affecting me yeah i've been it's i'm just really happy with being able to find something and not being disappointed with it um i was a little disappointed with the silver lines dizzy pods but i'm gonna give them another chance for sure because you know i just might not lie to i might not have liked the strain but yeah legend og watermelon skittles card this one's definitely a must try i mean i've had watermelon skittles a lot of times but in its live resin caviar form so having it in this uh this little can this little oil form is pretty nice yeah that should about wrap it up for this really quick cart review you know nothing too in-depth just just letting you guys know how i feel about it we'll definitely get more in depth when we get to a cart comps with this uh be on the lookout for that we'll be doing a cart comps between this buddy's cart and uh the very next cart you guys see in our individual cart reviews that that's going to be the one that will stack up so they're going to be some pretty hard hitters yeah thanks everyone for watching and we'll take one more hit for the road for you guys cheers oh yeah thank y'all for watching and we're going to see you on the next one for shout peach you out peace", "AZMrC0TjKdA": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street but [Music]", "xVeTgiJj1GI": "[Music] let's give my 420 friends is definitely time from that session for this one I'm gonna be having a double product review so the first thing that we got today is some cream of the crop oh gee diamonds once you guys to see that oh and that beautiful we got some diamonds today and then I also have a pre-roll front Grundig red Wonder Bread it's gonna be one of their premium pre-rolls actually came by my work and by the way you can pick up this stuff right here at my work empire Twin Palms um I got shot that out a little bit you know I mean alright this is not like you can get this just anywhere you know you can get at Empire but uh yeah they came by wasn't coming in and they did like a we did like a whole staff meeting was really cool they showed us some of their products I just love smelling it I really do I got to figure out what is specifically in this this is just a [ __ ] high-class pre-roll honestly it's way better than any [ __ ] trap shop one that I've picked up before and it's not made with shake or anything like that it's made with actual flower of all gram of flower alright I can't wait to smelt that up so they're smoking the diamonds actually I kind of want to keep that little little covering on makes alert look just a bit more fancy it really does I'm not gonna light this with any like lighter okay I'm gonna like this with some of the matches that they gave in the little douche bag after our after a little meeting that we had so it's gonna be cool I think it's gonna be cool it's gonna taste great too and as far as for you know dabbing on the damage there is really hard to fake between the travel rig and buddy it's been so long since since your dad's you got a pink old rig so long changing you know or changing the water and just hearing the function I love it now I've said before that the Joker rig is a little bit better than this one but I happen to have adapted with that rig in a while so I just thought it'd be nice to bring it out but pickle rig and with this whole set up like this here so that's just you know too hard to really choose and then here's a cool thing I don't know if you guys really see it and I probably should have probably shown you before I even placed on here but smokers Boutique hooked it up with a really cool Matt I'm probably gonna try to find a different one like one of the silicone ones but right now this one of Mario and Luigi passing a freaking joint on a couch absolutely I love it and I also found the freaking blue stock piece although it doesn't say it moves them but we all know it's [ __ ] huge stuff so definitely gonna have to give them credit [Music] oh that's cool so you can take it with you all bro this is legit this is a chip hold it right here I see okay I can figure this out but I don't think I'm gonna put it on well maybe I will put it on this this chain just cuz I can't put it on my actual down here alright so I'm gonna give up on that but we are gonna use we aren't gonna be using this move that right now so that'll be cool gonna be able to oh oh yeah that'll be cool look ye look that mousse lab X Wonderbread matter which side it goes dude this is awesome [ __ ] yes so yeah the package comes with three filters in total I think um I can either order some or pick some more up from smokers oh [ __ ] yeah Thank You Jay oh [ __ ] I forgot the torch all right let me go and get it I also forgot some q-tips so I also picked up some of those too all right I wanna start with a down we're gonna go with a dab just to kind of get and I get nothing review out of the way but just to get like the first a solid review I guess cuz I don't want to be like super high of this and then give like a whack ass high stony kind of review you know are these not off the back because I have tried this you know it's not like it's just been sitting here unbe not that um it knocks me out quick I really like it my concentrates like I try to have my concentrates primarily and because just so I can just leave my flowers I like my sativa dominant but this oh holy [ __ ] damn it it's one of those Anika's I'm gonna high bridge words like impacts a [ __ ] punch like you're not necessarily gonna be like couch lock you're gonna be you're coasting downhill after you take the down like that's just the best way I can work an ex as diamonds are like that was a somewhat rare I mean decent diamonds you know these are some good [ __ ] diamonds I can guarantee you that guys this is gonna be tasty this is gonna be my first down with a day honestly Howard diamonds you don't want to get you wanna I would say maybe mids mid high temp dad you know you don't want to [ __ ] burn all those Terps but you want to make sure you're out like you know you want to taste it you definitely want to taste it oh [ __ ] I need one of those what is it lemon tea it mat\u00edas has the diamond claw whatever it is I forget what it's called is it so yeah if you have like a standard Deb's I recommend using the wider end just because it's easier to take the diamonds get them in a nice clump I would do me a mic just don't want to drop it I don't so oh my god I forgot a [ __ ] cat - OH I mean I always always managing to under give them now I kind of like to just be safe okay you know I want to make sure I get all the terms I should have gotten the card are not honest statement I use the border a lot I do have [Music] [Music] I get a lemony taste which of course I'm always thinking with the lemony stuff I really need to branch out on that but who yeah I definitely taste some of some of my lemon eNOS that's just the first step and we got this [ __ ] drunk to go through I do not think I'm getting this nice shirt from the other night [Music] another trouble of mixing my bud and I've said this my flower I mean I said it before but uh you kind of I mean forget the strange names at least I do sometimes but you know what it is you know it's the taeho hybrid oh you just it's kind of just like Russian roulette almost like when you leave them Midway like that today me a masticate [Music] [Music] burn was I really appreciate most degree rolls on the head you know really have I gotten like it's not even that I pop no going to different ones and nuts using the FTP you know the burdens with most I'm just so uneven I was like I said there's there it's mostly like shake this is nice [Music] sharp sharp lingo which I try not to do anymore because I'm out of the gin shop but I would say is premium [ __ ] power obviously because it's a premium tree or a IRA preserve flower I mean yeah so but I mean [ __ ] it's even better than Private Reserve yeah it's premium [ __ ] flower I don't feel so couch locked anymore but how do I say it like so as I said you know what the Diamonds goes down a hill then Oh half a giant just kind of literally it didn't move the car narrow it just tilted the whole [ __ ] road so now it's it's like that down tio motion but not gravity pushing down on but like does that mean unless all that stop yeah stop and I'm coasting at the same time so neutral there we go alright let's take this down oh my god people rig please go easy on me - I'm sorry sorry I haven't dived with you in quite a bit we will restore pickle rate setup I promise you and for those of you who our first meeting pickle rig he was made by my my homie still only giving this was a custom rig that I asked him to make mark me shortly after season man what's it season to season to season - I'm currently watching all of it again just a occupy some time but I asked him and then we do up kind of like a concept art thing and it was just [ __ ] awesome you know the project which is awesome yeah I was checking the temper of the [ __ ] diamonds nice all right we're gonna get a little bit super [ __ ] high and I'm gonna have to use I think the other half of that J to let me up again let's get

off to edit this after after this oh man [Music] what's the one rule always bring water to the session you to fella I would definitely recommend picking one or both of these products if you have to stop by Empire palms you guys are gonna see a lot of stuff on this channel that I picked up either from there or just just because of the are just a part of itself but I would uh individually [Music] you guys know I don't have like a real rating system but maybe I should have one if you guys think I'll put it down because I want this to be an accurate that's possible rather than just be like oh I've worked so many security job there's just something tonight Java that's that's created this you know horrible [ __ ] issue of insomnia Anja's into that pattern so something like I mean you guys know what I mean just knock me out with an awesome show [Music] without being said you guys I think I'm definitely gonna call the success hopefully you guys enjoyed it especially if it was your first

safety tab there seal tape now I did have the Lost Coast tribal from them which was really good so mmm looks similar to that lost closed coast tribal diesel this is a sativa like I said that big chunk

here hold on time out I got it back in the jar safely guys ooh go scare some yeah it's really loose and it fell out of there I got it back in there throw out the jar I don't want to tilt it this way because it is move it kind of reminds me of just like the other one it's like a wet sand texture mmm well let me do a dab of this like I said I'll throw some in two puffs go also but this one isn't sticking to the bottom of the jar The Lost Coast tribal stuck to the bottom of the jar this is really like a dry wet sand texture not real wet sand like that The Lost Coast tribal was a lot more moist this is almost like a sugar we're gonna throw some in the puffs go got it in there got a really funky smell dough smells really good mmm mmm smells like gas okay that's ready let me get a dab on my tool and we'll heat this up yeah Lost Coast tribal diesel no that's the one I had before this is the blue dream yeah really similar though very very similar both sativas same color same texture except for this is a little bit more dry but and the loft the tribal was I think 89 so it was a couple more points higher let's give this Blue Dream sativa happy Saturday to you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section you have a good weekend now Joe Halloween go shout out to the guy seen in line at Rhys Erie I was coming out of the store yesterday in the morning with this and I also got out of the Blue Dream co2 cartridge which I'll probably do a review on that maybe it's Blue Dream co2 by rhythm I grabbed that too but as I was coming out some dude was like yo Alex it was like I watch you on YouTube I'm like oh I gave him a thumbs up okay but shout out dude that's cool it's a couple times I met subscribers in the line at Rhys Erie in Erie PA but they're dry right now I made sure I went over there early yesterday got me some because they have absolutely Saturday on the menu they have no dabs whatsoever and only like five different flower strains very low supply all the good cartridges are gone yeah my phone is right here yeah they were busy up there blue dream terpenes eight point nine nine percent terpenes eighty seven point eight cannabinoids the eighty four point six THC a and a point three of THC so it's like 85% THC with 87 being total cannabinoids you see if you guys can see that if you can see that little letter and yeah let me do that let me dab this Cheers very nice it said blue dream though one of my favorite strains by far know and I also grabbed some Sour Diesel flour but I'm not gonna review that already smoked half the eight persons yesterday mmm nice by rhythm though also I bought all rhythms stuff yesterday I bought the the Sour Diesel flower the blue dream resin and a blue dream cartridge if you want I can show you that flower real quick hold on it's a little bit different I know I usually don't do this guys but to show you I did buy that Sour Diesel flower eye rhythm didn't do a review on it but it did have some chunky chunky buds I put a Bovina packet at myself had two big-ass buds and a huge buds like that this is huge had two of them in there was the whole eighth for the Sour Diesel this was twenty seven percent THC that was from rhythm here I was smoking that up yesterday so I should have did a review on it but I didn't but it is excellent guys excellent bud except I threw the vivido pack in there just to keep it nice and fresh because I don't smoke flower too much so I'll probably have that for like a week or so but yeah Cheers let me hit this puffs coop for you DoubleTap sesh mode nice mmm-hmm that tastes really good Blue Dream by rhythm mmm man that tastes good that tastes better out of here than off that rig I do need a new banger mine's is pretty dirty so I do need a new one I

could tell let me know what you guys are smoking on have a great weekend thank you to all my new subscribers and thank you to my old subscribers growing this channel slowly but surely and yeah maybe we'll do start doing some new things like some vlogs or something in the future but for right now I guess I'm it's starting to get cold out up here in Erie so it's hard to go out vlogging when that's

mastered all a lot been following their careers for a long time but yeah sorry about that that's a little off-topic but yeah blue dream I'm already think I'm getting high I got that I'm buzzed blue dream excellent I'm out peace", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "mBQNU949whE": "what's going on guys welcome back it's lunar reviews coming at you guys with another video i hope you guys are really stoked for this one as soon as you guys see it you'll see why i'm saying that these uh these this product is only available in half grams live resin and they claim to be twice the amount of terps two times the terps that's what they claim and that's you see it right there guys heavy hitters heavy [ __ ] hitters excuse my language i'm bringing you guys lemon gelato first time ever trying lemon gelato gelato is an amazing strain as you guys know it's supposed to taste like blueberry sherbet and lemon with a hint of citrus and earthy that's what it says on their website this is a hybrid i'm gonna go ahead and read everything that i'm showing you guys here because it never focuses and never wants to let you guys know what the deal is so thc is coming in at 70.04 percent cbd is coming in at 0.12 percent just a little bit total active cannabinoid 73.56 percent manufactured and packaged the same date 7 9 20 20. so it's about four or five months old um six months old maybe let's go ahead and open it guys already uh rip it's a sticker this sticker holds it in place so that way you can't pull it out all you all i did was lift that sticker and that's literally all done with the box they're live these are only available in half grams you just push right here and it slides right out packaging is nice i love how they show the product i like how you can see the oil in the box and let's go let's get into it guys i haven't had a heavy hitter in years i haven't tried heavy hitters in so long they got the sticker they got the marijuana warning label but as a sticker which is no problem just take that off oil looks nice oil looks real nice uh kind of looks similar to the distillate in a way the distillates more yellowish this is more of an orange tone to it but looks nice for live resin you know half gram you know you see the head space right there you can see all the way straight through that [ __ ] a lot of headspace it's all right though you know it's normal i like how it says live right here it has the word live along with the heavy hitters double h logo take this rubber stopper off and let's see if i can get any flavors you guys any uh any aromas any scents or all that let's go ahead i like the tip like the tip it's not my favorite tip but it looks nice i'm not a big fan of it but i like how it looks all right let's go ahead and see if i can smell anything i do get a hint of sherbet the sherbet's there i don't taste anything but i do smell the strawberry it's definitely there all right let's go ahead and go for a draw let's go in for a drive this is my first time ever reviewing a half gram i've had a half gram in forever let's go ahead and see what this puppy is all about heavy hitters lemon gelato let's go cheers first smoke of the day wow that tasted really good lung expansion is there it fears that it fills the throat fills the lungs almost almost feels like a dab in the chest i did get i did taste the blueberry it's uh it's definitely there i didn't get the i didn't get too much citrus or lemon tones but i got blueberry for sure like blueberry was very strong sorry for anybody all the people walking by i'm at the park right now a lot of people this is a famous for a famous park for our people running around which is what i'm about to do after this review i'm gonna get stoned and run around this [ __ ] but in terms of heavy hitters it uh did their live resin um it's not very immediate but then that's also because it's live resin so i wouldn't expect it to be very immediate after a couple minutes it'll probably settle in and the high will start to fill it it's a hybrid so i do feel it a little bit in my head a little bit it's my first smoke of the day so i was sober before taking this first drag it tastes good i like the taste i'm not gonna lie i like the taste it's very it's very resiny with a hint of blueberry and you taste the sherbet but i'm trying to get the lemon i love lemon so let me see if i can get the lemon in there you smell the oh it smells like gelato all the way as soon as i vaped it now i'm smelling it from the tip smells like gelato all the way all right let's go let's go for another another puff big hit guys big foreign well here's the throat this one leaves your throat very scratchy for anyone wondering it's starting to sedate my eyes now eyes are starting to get real low all in all it's not bad it's definitely not a it's not as good as i was expecting it to be and reason being i thought it would be more um we'll talk about the potency in a bit you know i got to give it a couple more minutes before i can uh really say if it's potent or not but there's you know in terms of flavor the flavors the flavor is good it's um it's not very in your face type of flavor though it's not like something that like right there that last hit i completely missed flavor like there was no flavor in that last hit which is something that was happening a lot with the select for some reason so i don't know what's up with that but i did the what uh one hit i was able to get blueberry and some sherbet out of there so let's go ahead for uh another one guys this is very more this is definitely more of a sativa dominant hybrid in my uh experience vaping it right now it's uh i barely feel anything in the body really it's more of a cerebral high um so [Music] let's go for another one man let's see if this gets me uh if i can get a body high in this if i can feel a body huh so these guys right here i gotta be honest guys this is uh some good product but it's not something i would recommend you guys to go out and pick up reason being these half grams go for 60. i only got this one because it was a 25 off discount only reason why i got it so for 60 half gram i would completely avoid this like this is not even something that i would look in the direction of being in 60 bucks like maybe maybe for like a 30 buck 35 half gram maybe it's all right but i'll be honest the high is not very uh potent it's not uh it's not very uh in your face type of high like i feel it but i feel it very minimum like it's a very minimal miniscule high the bear uh it's barely there uh it's almost like i'm trying to compare it to a a vape cartridge that will give you a similar type of eye that's not very intense but it's uh it's pretty mellow it's relaxing um and i can't think of one at the moment because everything is so different you know so this is definitely in its own category it has a good high it has a good medicating effect to it but it's not very noticeable if that makes sense like the only reason why i'm able to pinpoint what i'm feeling is because i'm paying attention to it and i'm sitting here not doing anything but if i was on the goals i was if i'm if i was working and doing anything else i probably wouldn't even notice the high that i'm feeling so i would definitely skip out on this on this [ __ ] guys i would not try this this is lemon gelato and it doesn't taste as good as i was expecting it to i was like lemon gelato i have smells never had it sounds amazing doesn't taste as good as i thought it would so i would definitely would skip on this [ __ ] for sure two times the terps i don't know about that i don't know what that means i mean i would assume it means exactly what it's telling you it has twice the amount of terps but what i'm tasting isn't what they're telling me so who knows but let's see if i can i'll raise it to 3.3 volts and see if that changes anything cheers guys this wow a lot of vapor a lot of smoke so the flavor's there like you taste what it's telling you but i'm missing the lemon and the gelato taste isn't very um strong for being twice the terps it's like i picked the gelato up i pick up the flavor you're supposed to get but i pick it up for like a second or two and then it's gone as soon as i blow it out usually with another uh like ursa i always talk about ursa but they're fire guys ursa every hit is tasty until the smoke is completely gone out of your mouth like hitting it it's you're tasting it inhaling it you taste it and then exhaling it you still taste it for a little couple seconds this you when you're in when you only taste it on the inhale and then it's gone like the flavor's gone you don't taste anything blowing it out it's just like smoke and that could be because uh of how hot that dab was dab i mean it's 3.3 volts so it's not that bad the regular heavy hitter voltage is 3.7 but this is being live resin you know i'm not going to hit it on 3.7 that's ridiculous going to melt it but go ahead and uh one two three take it back to green 2.8 actually let's go back to blue that was actually a big hit i like that it got me more medicated so you might this the thing about heavy hitters you might just have to take heavy hits because it feel i mean it feels alright but for for the first smoke of my day like this is my first smoker in my day and it's already like about to be 1 pm it's first smoke of the day guys and my eyes are not like you know my eyes i'm doing this on purpose my eyes are not like that that's how i would normally be after reviewing some some dope product like my i would be like gone you know so me not feeling that already tells me that this isn't as a as potent as the maybe as the other cartridges they have but it's not as definitely not as potent as other brands that i've had definitely not as much as the select the selectors would fire so let's go ahead and uh take a last final hit for this uh in terms of my final opinion on it i mean vapor is there amazing vapor you get a lot of smoke the flavor is uh you know it's a it's a it's a 50 50 because the flavor is there but it's not there every hit so that's like you know that's not that's not good obviously and potency i would say the potency isn't there so i wouldn't i would skip this one if you're looking to get super high super baked i would i would probably skip on this one for sure and then the price guys that that that that kills it so the price totally kills it like don't even don't even bother like don't even bother trust me you're not it's not worth the 60 bucks it's not worth 40 bucks half a gram i don't know why they're worth uh why they're priced at that high but definitely not worth it so i'm going for this last final hit guys and then i'm gonna call it hope you guys are enjoying hope you guys like comment subscribe um if you're 18 or below 18 or younger please hop off the video if you haven't already and yeah let's go for this last hit cheers again no flavor damn that's unfortunate guys because lemon gelato's fire and lemon gelato sounds fire so it's unfortunate i'm not getting the the the taste that i would expect from it but nonetheless all those hits and i still feel the same as i did after the first hit so that's i'm not getting any higher i'm not so that's damn that's definitely not good for this i hope you guys don't waste your money on this [ __ ] and you guys will catch me in the next one i hope you guys enjoy comment anything that uh you guys how you guys feel about heavy hitters i mean someone recommending me they're distillate and after trying the live resin which is just as much as their

expiration 421 2020 obviously one year as they always do so i did a little homework on this one and it wasn't as easy to find as i thought so i came up with three things the first was they said they claimed it was dance hall and blueberry cross that's what i found with the first one don't know where they got that from don't know don't care the next one i found was that each batch is different they're not going to find the same like this batch is this next batch will be different this one says alchemy jack skellington jack the ripper jelly bean and quirkle again i don't know it's you can't find it it's hard to lock down that i wish they had better genetics information so i have no idea those are the things that i found the third like i said the third thing was that none of the batches are the same so either way i was excited i was like ooh strain mo sounds exciting you know sounds like a mixture which is what i like i like hybrids i'm all about my hybrids oh as you can see i haven't cracked into it yet that sticker's still intact we will break the seal together oh so satisfying [Laughter] all right peachy little jar yes i was referring to the color and being silly i do love these jars i do they're perfect size they are the only ones that are the perfect size to fit in the little concentrate pocket on the g pen connect case so i can either take more rhythm

perfect size jar they're not ridiculously big okay let's crack her open oh with some pretty looking stuff i'm gonna crack the light on here let's see hmm that's an interesting nose um hold on just a second let me make sure i smelled that correctly because it almost had a chemical smell at first no no it's um hmm it's it's like citrusy so it could i could see where i got that chemical thought originally it's got a very citrusy odor but not enough to be like overpowering just i like that i really like that smell and if you look at that that's really pretty stuff it's not too bright it's not too dark i mean you can see it's really nice color it it looks fantastic um i picked this one up and i picked up another one that came as a 2 gram bucket i really hope it's good because it's a two

way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

(upbeat music)", "J_0_qwXlhEM": "[Music] [Music] ah yeah guys what a big Dan over here coming back got you yeah and now we're doing a quick little video because I get a million questions asked about this subject pretty much every day I get at least 10 to 20 comments or emails asking about this subject and the subject is how to make THCA from shatter or wax or pho all yeah so uh there you have it you got some saucy turkey diamonds the diamonds are around anywhere between 96% eighty to ninety nine point six percent THC a and you can see the nice derpy a little bit of Terp sauce layer in there with the Terp sauce will contain random cannabinoids from CB g CB d CB and stuff like that and then all your Terps whether it be in lemon een pining and the rest of a mercy and all that stuff but um yeah this video is in explaining what diamonds are it's explaining how I make my methods of making THC TAC a or diamonds or sauce turf sauce or turf diamonds or whatever you want to call it you can see that the crystallization is fairly big with the strain and yeah you can see the diamonds themselves are nice and clear and the sauce layer is nice and golden okay so let me break it down alright so first step is you got to make your you got to make a BHO pack the columns pack the tubes wait uh this is exactly how I do it I do fresh plant right off the plant right into the two pound columns on a closed loop fold you axis then I go from best value of x mmm I use only try ice I don't use liquid nitrogen right into that I just packed the column the jacket on the column with dried ice I packed the tubes full with my material which is a fresh off the plant you could do it with dried buds whatever you want but I just the best herb profile will come from live plants or fresh frozen something like that and then I do my run just like anyone else I'll blast through the column and then I'll pull the ball valve and then once I pulled a ball valve I will it'll dumped into the dewaxing chamber and then I'll let that sit for a little while let it be wax I'll pull that ball valve and let that dump into the collection pot I will then heat the collection pop however you heat your collection pot I just use a hot water bath and then while that's heating and evaporating back into the solvent tank getting yourself in potty or BHO I will then look through the sight glass and I'll leave a good amount of butane left in it now that's up to you how much you ran in and all that so I'll make sure it's nice and soupy so I could just dump it right out now when it's nice and soupy I release the pressure and then pop the cap and then dump it into a jar just like the bigger the bigger versions and these balls right here the big quart jars I will then cap the jar I'll put it in a cooler that the cooler Pole has some dry ice in it so it stays nice and cold and then BAM I'll leave that there and I'll pop the jars maybe once or twice a day burping them and after about five days you'll see diamond stone form at which point I will not use dry ice anymore and I'll keep it pretty much every room temperature and then I'll perform a two three four times a day I check them randomly and I'll burp the jars just you probably don't have to do that but I just do it to make sure the pressure isn't building up so much that's going to pop the capsule off or break the jars for anything so I check on them from time to time open them up and check on my own see how they're growing after a week you'll see bigger diamonds after two weeks for the biggest diamonds something similar to this now it is all strain dependent some strains have much bigger Terp Terp layer and then some strains have smaller diamonds more turf some strains have bigger diamonds less Terps yada yada so that's all up to the strains but that's how it's done I don't you know pentane wash the solvent I use for extraction is just n butane from best value back switch is 99.9% pure butane medical grade extraction grade comes in the green tank you can buy all that stuff right up best value packs they got a good prices good material and I never did me wrong but out yeah that's how it's done so uh I know I did a video with the robot voice trying to explain this and I feel that video was uh sufficient and I think it gave all the same thing I just said broke it down much quicker and you didn't have me up in there saying and all this shift so for everybody that just wanted a little revamp of the process that's how it's done that's exactly what I did to make these that's what I do to make all all my Terp sauce or diamonds or whatever you want to call it that's how I make it I hope this helps anybody out and if you liked the video smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and throw some comments and you could shoot me an email visit the website whatever you want to do and I'll get at me I'm down I'm always here to help and uh yeah there you go beautiful diamond so you can see they're all nice and clear swimmin oh yeah okay guys I hope that helped enough big Dan over now peace out [Music] [Music]", "ZzuxwwTKk5c": "oh this is not a plush toy to make me change I become like a castaway you know your page that you bought the color today game is goodie to get your voice mpg back at it with another fire waiting for you guys man so for today's review man I got a Corolla right here man yeah you heard it right kirova the comfy that makes I think they started off making edibles and then just the transition into making marijuana you know actual bud and then cartridges and things like that so they're branching out into the cartridge game I got myself right here it is a mimosa it is a Clement Lucie if I can go ahead and get that a little focused in for you guys one time so this right here is the momo mimosa it is a clement i'm / purple punch and men you know but most is is obviously one of the better sativas out there that i that i feel like you know they just the sativa that just gets you extremely baked but also lets you do your thing without making you feel like super super like your mind is running if you get what i mean which is something that a lot of sativas do so you got to be careful what you choose so yeah I got the memo so right here this one's sitting actually at a 78 point 81 percent THC so that's not too bad actually I was expecting a little bit a little bit more but honestly what can we can do right so open this up right away men it comes in this nifty ISO container I haven't seen any cartridges come in containers like these as of late so I uh yeah all you do is just unscrew this unscrew it all the way throw that to the side cuz you're only gonna need this cartridge so right here boys I got the mimosa from Corolla this is a full gram I think they do have it in half grams also I'm not too sure about that but I have seen full grams all over the place men on the bottom it says Korova unrivaled alright so we're gonna go ahead and test it out man see if it actually isn't rebel because I feel like with a lot of a let me mind you this is a distillate cartridge this isn't a librarian cartridge this isn't anything too special man so I'm not my hopes aren't too high I'm kind of hoping it tastes good I like my mosula it's one of the few teams that I like but you know when it comes to distillate not a lot of distillate companies can do good the only distillate companies I personally feel like I've been doing a great job with their product is dizzy and plug play those two distillate company - probably the only ones and wrong garden - just remember they're additionally company not a lot rather company so I want to take a ghost hit but I got the fan point I mean go ahead and turn off real quick boys here we go we got the Korova mimosa sitting on the raw garden battery I currently don't have any variable wattage batteries man I lost my favorite battery which was whose if you guys in a little slim twist one I'm trying to look for it I'm hoping I can find it soon but as soon as I find it you guys are getting Ben your video out of it man so before we take a hit demands go ahead and try to hit 500 likes on this video I appreciate everyone who's been tuning in lately man during this whole quarantine I've been getting a lot more subscribers and I just want to welcome you all to the GFN man so if you guys are over the age of 18 to 21 let's let's get to smoking boys chewed so right off the bat that first initial hit man I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to like like tasty I don't know if it's just the first hit that was like that let's go ahead and try to get the other wing quipped up and then because that's one thing that I wanna let you guys know to win and whenever tasting out a new code don't ever base off the first hit just for the simple fact that you know the coil takes a while to get whipped up and things like that you gotta burn through the oil and you gotta just absolutely taste the flavor so we're gonna be taking a couple hits and I'm gonna take a couple hits until we get into the flavor until we had super big so cheers guys mmm it doesn't all right after that second dish okay I did get a little bit more flavor I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the dr. zodiac battery because I think that this one is a little bit stronger because for distillate cartridges the other ones for live resin so for that second hit though I did get a better flavor profile I tasted a little bit of a like a Clementine like a little sweetness sourness so not too bad not too shabby not too shadows go ahead and just keep going though [Music] the taste that I'm getting though is it is it isn't like a oh wow do you like you know just astonishing taste that you would like to get from a cartridge Billie like I feel like I'm getting more of like a dis elyda taste then I'm getting of terpenes like I I think this is lacking a lot intervenes as of now man after the first initial hits a man you should at least taste something you know you should at least provide a consumer with something that the first hit the first two to three hits man and you should just smack you in your face and want to keep want you to keep hitting it more and more right with this one I don't even feel like hitting it anymore just because off of those two three hits like I kind of don't even feel like I don't get that taste that I like you know I don't get that oh gee earthy goodness or I don't get that that fruity berry nasur I don't get anything it's just very very dissolute eat like if you know how desolate cartridges they just taste like like THC oil like just straight-up oil like and I mean that's that's one of my big issues with distillate companies you know you feel like for the most part you know desolate companies just don't get the the mixtures right when it comes to their disel is slash terpene mixtures it is just disgusting because you could either end up with a really really good dissolute like cartridge or pod like plug and play and dizzy where they kind of balance it out with the perfect amount of THC and the perfect amount of terpene and it also depends on what what you know dis lit you're using in the first place how refined it is how well process it is and what buddy used to produce that desolate and there's just so many steps and I feel like with this like they're not there yet they're definitely not there I'm sorry Korova but you're definitely not there yet I would probably just stick to edibles as of now man but I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it maybe it'll get better as we get along then so cheers guys like I am getting a little bit more of the mimosa now a little bit more yeah you like kind of more of the Clementine than the purple punch but like I said man just the ratio of dis Allah to Turkey mixture it's just like you want something and that's gonna be in your face you know you want to be able to taste it right here I feel like I'm just smoking straight of disel it like yeah I do get the little hints of Clementine in the back but it's just very very subtle like at this point I might as well just be smoking oil I just straight up this little oil with no terpenes because the terpenes then dilute it to making it less cheap see and then um damn a mother will just give us that you straight-up hardcore og dissolute man but I have nothing good to say about this I'm not gonna lie I have nothing good at all like these all right let's just break it down let me break it down for you guys so right off the bat I would say though I would say here's the upside of it they're packaging their presentation skills are phenomenal they post on weed maps they pose the pictures that they post the things that they post is just like oh [ __ ] that's the main reason why I got it in the first place this is the main reason why I got interested service because the presentation was outstanding just likes dizzy just like politically just like any other company that's doing big right now you know the packaging is on point that's something that I say is key in every single product because when you're looking at something you want to buy something that's visually it's visually appealing first then it is anything else you know because you're not gonna be able to taste the based off of a look so I'll based off of that that is another reason why I got it but opening it up like when I first saw this I liked I looked at the tip and it seems to be like not even a normal tip like some plastic [ __ ] so I touched it not even not a ceramic just a very very low grade and it's very very light though very very light compared to other cartridges not like I can I can barely feel like it's in my hand and then other than that man they that the oil quality it's thick it's thick I'm not gonna lie it's thick I've been hitting it this whole entire time and it's been it's been hitting it's been think it hasn't been moving at all definitely some good distillate but at the end of the day it all matters on how it tastes on how it gets you high it hasn't even gotten me high dude where are you going to take some fat-ass head see if it gets me home we go ahead and take a blinker for you guys if that boy here doesn't get me high I don't know what to say man so cheers guys go ahead and take a blinker with me [Music] he no longer expand me I got a little bit of lung stretch and just B's due to all this smoke go ahead but it wasn't like like crazy do you like with the plug play like I know I bring up other brands but it because it's comparisons you know you want to compare distillate brands with the distillate brands you want to because other other people who have tried who want to try kirova for example the chances are they already tried still Z plug play you know all the big names on marquee right now and this this is my job man this is what I'm here it's to tell you you guys you know what's good what's not that way yes don't go out wasting your money like I [ __ ] did pretty by the way that or cheat cart that I bought they didn't work at all guys so that's it down yeah nothing at all for that blinker I I feel a slight head change just off of that blinker but it's nothing like hot [ __ ] like I'm faded off my ass it's nothing like that at all and I'm kind of disappointed man like I feel like like people are just taking advantage of like the [ __ ] that they have you know the money that they have in trying to produce stuff that isn't good quality at all like I'm sorry but this these cartridge companies have to be stopped like these cartridge companies have to be stopped now because I'm tired of wasting my damn money on cartridges that look good look like they're gonna taste good but they're ass I'm [ __ ] tired of they do it alright so I'm from now on man I think I'm starting people I'm sorry calling companies out on the [ __ ] that they make because it's so disturbing man the amounts of money that I spend on cartridges and [ __ ] and still I am not satisfied with what people produce it's kind of like I thought that's just how it's gonna be man you know especially now with the inflation in the cannabis community if you were gonna be taking advantage of it but like it just sucks man so Korova you go F yourself I don't want anything to do ever with your product again you're trash get out of mind getting out of the stores anything don't ever caught this company and yeah I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here guys if you guys enjoyed today's review go ahead and leave a like go ahead and leave a comment so I could talk to you guys like calm me back to everybody by the way and most importantly though leave a subscribe it helps your boy out more than you know so gfm we'll catch you guys in the next one then we practice fifty shades of gray function on the ground buddy no goes obviously good money I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on I mean", "GtHm-qFZ-0E": "howdy guys and dolls out there and youtube land your favorite little keto goofball diamond and today is day 1089 of my ketogenic journey going from 311 pounds to where i sit today i'm going to show you what i ate yesterday talk to you all about it and tell you why i probably shouldn't have done it and then i'll be right back with a chit chatting away and don't forget to like subscribe share ring that bell all that good youtube jazz it helps this channel grow it makes me smile and uh it's time to rant rave and misbehave keto diamond style by the way it's 106 degrees in north carolina today my goodness three two one all right so here's everything i ate yesterday and everything i ate yesterday was new to me and well we'll talk about the results in a minute all right you guys i'm breaking about a 17 hour fast i don't know exactly how much is in here of everything my son bro uh works at sonic brought me this bowl home two grilled chicken patties some bacon and some cheddar melted the top looks good let's try it did you add bacon no i thought you said there was bacon in it oh okay okay so it's chicken and cheese chicken and cheese performance nut butter's just arrived thank you miss angie go stick these in the freezer cause i like them frozen nice yummy salty nutty cold treat okay you guys i got really hungry around 7 p.m we stopped by harris teeter i will be showing these in a grocery haul i hope this is keto friendly because i had two thirds of the bar which is one and a half servings and it is sweetened with stevia so we're just gonna have to see no monk fruit sweetener i'm sorry my fruit sweetened yeah that's what it says in there we'll see a serving no one serving of these jalapeno parmesan cheese crisps i tried multiple things today so i'm not going to be surprised if the scale goes up tomorrow so i'm having a sausage egg and cheese biscuit this is actually my third one it's a new recipe i'm trying and they turned out phenomenally um i will be sharing the recipe that i got from over at keto rewind uh either before you see this or right after you see this alrighty y'all saw what i ate yesterday let's pull this down just a hair see i saw what i ate yesterday right every last bit of it was new to my body things i've never tried before and it's all right to do that once in a while but the thing is while everything on the top half of the day worked very well or i felt fine felt great my weight didn't go up the last thing i ate yesterday seemed to affect me the only way to tell was to try it again and i did try and broke my fast with it this morning and it was most definitely that so while i did a recipe of it and i'm gonna leave it up because it might not affect everybody the same way it affected me it is low carb it is whole food um but it definitely messed with my body so last night after eating it i went up two pounds today after eating it within an hour of eating it i went up 2.4 pounds now let me explain throughout a normal day for me as long as i stay keto my weight fluctuates right up under two to three pounds a day sometimes not as much just depending on what i eat but it's never more than three pounds on a strict keto good day but 2.4 pounds after eating one meal within an hour of eating one meal that's a big difference it was a noticeable change in my body there are multiple reasons for this and i'll tell you see last night i wasn't sure if it was just because of everything i had ate eaten throughout the day or if it was just that one thing because you know things will combine and if you hit a carb threshold for your body that could just knock you out of ketosis all by itself well this morning i started feeling pretty good again i was feeling great i said okay well let's give this meal a try because i have leftovers so i threw it in the oven cooked it up and lo and behold 2.4 pounds within an hour after trying it and i feel so tired i could fall on my face like i haven't slept in a week which is part of it i get tired lethargic sometimes when i get kicked my sinuses of course have gone a little haywire my ankle which sometimes feels like i have broken it when i've when i've been kicked it's not that it's just it's joint pain from where i have um sprung my right ankle so much that it will frequently act up or flare up on me when i get kicked so i definitely know i was affected 100 now it does annoy me that i stole this recipe from another keto youtuber but i was reminded that this other youtuber does work out i believe she was healthier than i was to begin with so the things she can get by with the things you can get by with and the things i can get by with separate things this is also why i don't try too many keto recipes you'll notice if you watch my channel my foods are generally really boring with things that i eat over and over and over again which i prefer not to do but at the same time i prefer not to hurt and be kicked out of ketosis or gain weight so also there are other things in this um the cream cheese now i did hear seattle seattle sapphire told me she's another keto youtuber look her up that she has found a lactose free cream cheese and cheddar cheese so i will probably be looking for those because i do have issue issues with lactose it could have been the cream cheese in it could have been the coconut flour it's kind of a hit or miss for me sometimes but the recipe is great the taste is phenomenal it's not worth the way i feel today but you never know if you don't try it right so i definitely know i definitely know that it kicked me and again you guys have to overlook me it is smoking in here steaming absolutely hideously hot um i was hoping to be able to do my first vlog in my minivan that my son and his girlfriend gave to me what kind of sword it gave to me basically they they paid 1900 they're going to charge me 1500 but i can pay 100 a month i'll take it and it's supposed to have phenomenal ac and phenomenal heat and the radio works and now there could be an issue with the front axle we're not sure the the passenger side axle uh it could have been simply that day she had a flat tire in the rain and it yanked her so we're not sure yet i have gotten the insurance on it i'm waiting for my youtube paycheck so i can get my tags on it why did i get on this part of the story let's go ahead and weigh in i'm so sorry i'll tell you about the rest of that thing so here's the weigh-in for the day all right good morning folks 160.2 annoying but not all that surprising yesterday i kept repeating my videos over and over that my way in for yesterday was 159 but when i weighed in on the scale when you saw that it was 158.8 so i don't know why i was getting it off it's not far off but it was 158.8 today it's 160.2 so that's 1.4 pounds up and i was like i said kit and there's no telling what it's going to be tomorrow because you'll see what i eat today tomorrow and i'm going to keep it keto completely but i already know i was affected i just already feel drug down it feels like i'm being drugged to the bottom of a river or something speaking of a river i'd like to go swimming today in ice cold mountain water you know what i mean but anyway so just because i knew i was affected just because i know i'm kicked just because i know my weight's going to go up does not mean i need to make it worse that does not mean go in there and have a little debbie cake it does not mean go in there and have some cheesecake or some french fries it doesn't mean any of that what it means is to make your next moquito get back on the horse keep on trotting along you don't want to sit in the being kicked too long and anything you do can stretch out how long you feel bad how long your weight goes up so it's important for me at this point knowing that i've been affected twice in a row by the same meal because i wanted to make sure it was that it's important for me to keep pressing forward it's important not to fall off the wagon entirely because something happened or i did something crazy even if i had woke up this morning and had a cupcake that's not a good reason to have five cupcakes okay it's a good reason to stop what you're doing wait until you're hungry eat a keto meal and that's my plan now yesterday since everything was new to my body any number of things could have been the culprit but since i was not affected until after that last meal and when i eat something i'm not sure about i tend to get on the scale beforehand so i know what i already weigh before i ate the meal last night i was at 160.4 after eating that meal i had jumped up to 162 which means i automatically knew i was going up today and the same thing again happened today when i got on the scale beforehand and got on the scale afterwards gaining 2.4 pounds so it definitely was that um that i had a keto chocolate mint bar yesterday i'm not a big fan of chocolate milk but i gotta be honest we found that at harris teeter and it was great i have a milk chocolate one but i'm gonna wait until later to eat it because i want to make sure that i'm back in ketosis from today before i try that otherwise i won't be able to tell if i can have it i won't be able to tell if it affects me and it would just make my weight go up more if it does affect me so i'm going to wait for tomorrow to eat that or try that and make sure i'm back in ketosis first you never know if you don't try there right and and ingredients are key ingredients are a big key for me even though these ingredients are a whole foods doesn't mean they won't affect you or me now again i'm leaving that recipe up because it might not affect you you might be fine with it me not so much but it stitches my journey right so oh okay so back on the minivan thing i already got insurance on it i want to go get tags on it but see i get a youtube paycheck and that's what i'm going to use to do it with my youtube paycheck i think this month is about 270 i've already gotten the letter from youtube saying that it's going to my bank account but once they send the letter it can be anytime today so you know i keep checking it's not in there i keep checking it's not in there so hopefully hopefully it'll be in there before the tag office closes and go get a set of tags i'm going to leave it my son's name because for one i'm still paying on it for two he would never do me dirty so i'm not really worried about it he would rather give me something than take it away from me so i'm not concerned um but i'm very thrilled i'm so thrilled to have a good vehicle with a good air conditioner you all don't even know huh and i have that old blazer and ac works but if you use ac too long it runs hot and it needs a um head gasket and then my truck blew up so you know i'm not big on minivans though but i'll take it all right it's gotta see this guy heat we gonna ride y'all hopefully if it turns out the axle's not bad i might have to buy an axle too we'll just have to see how that works but i'm excited about that i'm excited to finally get back into ketosis because this sucks i feel it feels like i'm almost drowning i just want to lay down and go to sleep and just let it go you know but i'm all right um i do want to ask you guys who are the praying type descend miss melanie over princess ninja and keto some prayers now she doesn't put out

"[Music] [Applause] [Music] what is up everybody back at it with another one welcome to Pine Street a 21 and over medical cannabis review Channel out of the state of Pennsylvania pine if you're new to the channel thanks for watching if you like what you see do me a favor give it a thumbs up hit that subscribe and comment I love comments especially right now everybody's kind of got a lot of spare time on their hands so if you're looking to talk talk to me through the comments let me know what you're smoking on let me know what you think of the videos and yeah thanks for coming I appreciate every single one here let's turn the email on and get into it so today hopefully we have a slapper today I'm thinking this is gonna come through with some flavor the last one was kind of a letdown a bit of a new company really interested to see what else they come out with but wasn't what I was expecting it to be so but with this here we got some prime live the blue box not the purple box you know the expensive one and yeah it is PT star queen number 12 live resin yeah check that out PT star clean like resin I don't know if that'll focus but I'll I'll let you see it when I bring the camera a little closer let's get into the numbers let's see here cannabinoids THC coming in at zero point zero THC a coming in at eighty four point four one three percent everything else is a 0 th CV CBD CBD a CBD b CB n CB g CB c everything comes in at zero now as far as the terpenes go we have busy bolo coming in at 0.08 for beta car coming in at 0.33 9 beta Merc coming in at 6.50 9% six point five zero nine that is a lot of beta Merc so we can expect this to taste floral clothi kind of earthy even though earthy isn't a very good descriptor in my opinion what does the earth taste like I've never eaten dirt before but that's what I assumed the descriptor of earthy tasting like to me it sounds like tastes like a mouthful of dirt but in reality what it is it's more of like a it's a floral kind of note to the whole thing it brings like a like a flowery floral like vapor almost this kind of like kind of let you ever smell flowers and you know just to have that that vapor that's what the Merc is we got beta Pyne coming in at 0.34 five humans 0.089 limonene coming in at 1.30 three percent so above a percent so 1.3 percent which means we will get a lot of lime in it Linna bull 0.129 terpene allene 0.011 and pining 0.41 four percent so lots of chirps which is what we like to see we like to see you know flavor because that's what Terps are Terps are flavors I can't justify spending the kind of money that the Pennsylvania medical program requires you to spend and not have products that are just punching you in the mouth with flavor so I like to see a lot of Terps so let's get into it well break this open and I guess I should grab the hammer [Music] all right so here's this for you guys hopefully it foap this is pretty good yeah it was pretty quick focus pretty quick focus all right there's that we're gonna give it the old sniff test as always cap came off in the cat oh yeah oh yeah you get a lot of that limonene coming through or what did I say right yep got a lot of that lime in here smells like really gassy sprite and as I like I always consider that gassy smell of lime and pine one of my favorites one of my personal favorites lime lime and pine here is your thing as always they never stick I have seen them stick to other other jars not not medical but other industries in other states with recreational and I have actually seen those lids stick to these jars Prime's just really bad at it so but that's okay cuz they make up for it in crazy crazy flavor look at that that is just crazy looking clear as day no real gold or yellow no real colors just a whole lot of sauce and what looks like sugary diamonds basically but yeah this stuff is not bad not bad let's move it around a little bit kick up some of them Terps so yeah I don't get a ton of the Merc but I do get a lot of the pine in the lime so this should be a slapper this should taste phenomenal PT star dog is probably one of my favorites it's got a crazy flavor to me personally it has like a baja blast mountain dew kind of flavor so I'm hoping this kind of comes through like that does yeah it's a little nice little back la before you guys go ahead and get rid of the auto follow let's get down to it all right let that slow melt grab my capper give you a capper Rooney we're in no hurry that's the joy of an email no hurry so pho here we go [Music] I really did that huh I really just spaced out and dry hit the mother ship I forgot that I just cleaned this the other day and never refilled it [Music] nonetheless that being said I will fill this up in a second but an exceptionally smooth dry hit from a bong with flavors of what I can only describe as sprite it has a truly sprite like taste and I'm gonna say something I don't think I've ever dry hit a bong like that like on accident it's not as bad as you think it is not a smooth but still kind of good [Applause] but yeah this stuff does not taste like the star dog it doesn't have as much of what I like to call like a coconutty taste the star dogs definitely had more of a coconut taste this is just tastes like sprite it's like lemon lime a little bit of pine in there because of the pioneering and [ __ ] but for being honest this just tastes like like sweet sweet sprite like lemon-lime sprite all right so I'm gonna go ahead and try to find some water in this room real quick because you boy don't purposely hit a dry bong ever let's see what we got in here do I got any water oh you do not how do I not have any more oh man that's funny yourself give me five seconds I'll be right back and I'll probably edit this part out it's not sorry about that ah how often can you say that happens oh never for me personally I'm not a accidentally hit a drug long kind of guy but today must have been a super special day for me so as far as flavor I'll have way too much water in it oh yeah we're gonna have to slow hit this alright so as far as flavor it's not as punchy as a lot of the prime stuff is I wouldn't put it I wouldn't put this in the same category as like the orange chem soda or the sour blueberry which is a personal favorite of me and most of the people I know but it is it is more flavorful than a lot of companies that are just as expensive telling you the mothership is so good you can overfill it you still don't pull anything into your mouth makes no sense to me the quality glasses quality --get glass it doesn't matter how you how you stack it bent neck and everything that thing's amazing but yeah anyway let's get down to the ratings let's not make this a 30 minute video like normal um as far as smell smells great give it like a 9 out of 10 smells like lemons and pine trees super super dank I would wear it as cologne if they made it as far as the looks go you already saw the close-up white clear saucy beautiful just south just that south you know like doesn't get much better um as far as flavor it tastes good it tastes like sprite it's got the flavor the flavors are there it's not that it's not there it's just that you know it's not my personal favorite I do like lemon I do like pine and I do like lime but if it tasted a little bit more like it smelled I would like it a little more but it just tastes like sprite like really flavorful like Danks priety concentrates you know but yeah it gets a nine out of ten their price God the price sucks so bad but it's it's what we're paying it's it's the market guys you know like what can we do good grams are between 80 and hundred bucks and it's a sin and shame on people for making it that way but it's what we have to deal with until it becomes better so price we shouldn't even honestly we shouldn't even base things on price unless the price and the quality don't match up you know like if we get an $80 gram and it's absolute Pope then we might talk about the price a little bit but like yeah it's expensive but it delivers like it delivers it does all the things you want it to do and more the high super good super mellow not like rekt not like I want to sink into this chair and do nothing but like you know still still stony still like chill so very nice blended hybrid I would even almost say it's as close to 5050 as a thing can be which is awesome cuz 50/50 blends are like sativa indica 5050 is it's a nice feeling to be stoned but not too stoned like able to do things and function but still medicated and enjoying yourself so I can appreciate that that gets a nice 9 out of 10 like overall I give it a 9 out of 10 because that's about what it is man I mean nothing screams like anything special about it it's 85% so it's not like a hundred percent pure or anything which you know sometimes that like grabs your attention you know it's just overall it's what you would expect from a prime concentrate it's a nine out of ten I would pick it up again definitely like I said not the most flavorful but way more flavor than a lot of other companies on the market so you get what you pay for it's like moxie and prime those are your flavor like they come through and then like right behind prime I would say is uh Cresco they're [ __ ] lime skunk and they're blueberry space cake is phenomenal and they keep coming out with blends now that are pretty good like so J was it so J times space cake it was blueberry space cake so J haze mix and now there's a bio Jesus mix cross with something else which I'm sure it tastes great but those are your three top tier most expensive but also most flavorful companies in my opinion and then there's other companies that are just as expensive but don't really don't really bring the Terps so they kind of in my opinion don't even they're not even in the same category like you can say you're in the same category but you're not and it all comes down to flavor and if you smoke your smoker you'll know some stuff's got zero flavor but it's high and percentage and like THC percent but it's not as enjoyable to smoke as something that's like 85% and punches you in the mouth of flavor so it really comes down to the individual and what they're trying to do is I like to enjoy a thing that I'm partaking in and I like for that thing to do it's intended you know medicate because that's your intentions to medicate so words are hard I got stoned I'm gonna end it now because now I'm just babbling if you like the videos like and subscribe I appreciate everybody we're trucking along I met like 55 almost 60 subs and a couple hundred on Instagram so you know spread the word tell your friends and I appreciate you guys if it wasn't for you guys I wouldn't even bother doing this honestly I would just do other things so thank you for watching and giving me a reason to keep on making these videos so hope you have a good one and hope everybody staying safe peace out day in this [Music]", "SoVy7emFQOk": "you're smokin man growin and watch it fall down [Music] DGC Scottie real hanging out and doing something very interesting thank you for Jason from dialed in Terps for coming in I am really interested in trying to learn what do they call this they have to make these high-end extracts and now I always thought they made them with BHO and whatnot now Jason comes over and says no you can actually make them using real high-end water hash and pressing that into rosin and then you jar it up is that this jar tech is that what they call this yes jar tech it's um it's fresh frozen material that's then turn into bubble hash exactly like you said and depressed in the rosin and at some point you know you have to decide what you want to do with is our consistency goes right why is it look so different what's it start out so it starts out as rosin right yeah it's really suffered rosin okay we got a picture of that Ross and that [ __ ] is so bright why the hell is that rosin so bright white well you know quality in quality out you know you want to start with the best material possible when you're starting with the fresh products and you've matured a trichome to its full maturity right and still hold a nice color but I've seen things that are yellow I've seen things that are a dark almost like a tan brown and by the way it can be dankus [ __ ] but I seem like the 710 labs they do that real white five-star water hash sure and you're saying five stars kind of this five star material yeah I think 710 would probably be doing more if they're selling it they're gonna be doing a six star but the [ __ ] the difference help a brother out man all right six stars as good as it gets six stars as good as it gets no cars both wash goes all right that's the bright whites they all really light do you holo bright whites a full milk bubble hash okay put it on a bowl there's not gonna be any residue left got it and that's what's gonna burn clean right that's really what they're looking for for a full bubble hash by the way that 6r that's just expensive man I don't even know I bought that a little bit $75 a gram and I had like no second thoughts after I went through it or like 10 15 bucks it's just you want to do a few it is delicious I agree so is that what that way you end up with here or that's what we start with most stuff you're president of rosin would be a five star hash and what the difference is starting material yes the starting material is gonna leave a little bit of residue if you put a five star hash and a puff go peak it's still gonna taste delicious right you're gonna really enjoy it it's just gonna leave a little residue at the bottom of the bowl when you clean it you ever smoked bubble hash and you see that that's gonna be a five star hash or a four star hash and again I'm just trying to understood the difference is the quality of the material going in right so six star hash this is gonna be no residue it's gonna burn totally clean Wow just like you know when you smoke a full mil okay so what does this start out as this is five star what do you what do you call this this is five star material for that okay with I work really hard in house to peruse really nice flowers that I've fries fresh beautiful right beautiful you've been here about ten years right no I think we both heard the calling and yeah left our homes to come and be growers be growers out in public I love it I really enjoyed my 10 years in Colorado it's I'm home now yeah you're relieved oh yeah you're right he's right by the mountains absolutely beautiful beautiful up there I'll come visit you can't visit me I'll come visit you next time man all right all right let's get into these jars guru's got beautiful pictures of the jars over there yeah what what are we starting Wesley this jar tech I totally don't actually get to start material over here it's mousey absolutely yeah we got everybody in the shop hey that's I think it's secure I meant to do an AB you take that live you know fresh frozen bubble hash it goes into a freeze dryer okay so this is definitely freeze dryer right huge how beautiful beautiful that's what happens when my friends come over you all right so I've took 56 grams yesterday or this morning actually I woke up early at 6 a.m. right and press 56 grams of bubble hash okay and that's important you didn't press flour you're pressing 56 grams of bubble hash gotcha and that's how you really get the old dry quality Cessna and the bubble has just been dried in the freeze dryer okay and now what's in a freezer until I pressed it so to help me out I understand why everybody wants a freeze dryer why why that's like the key to super high quality okay a pretty dryer really is gonna preserve all the terpenes all the cannabinoids and it's gonna preserve its freshness and make it absolutely just perfect right so what so and your freeze drying the buds the flowers before you or your freeze drying the hash here freeze rather than bullish she's got imperious drying the bullish beautiful without losing any of terpenes right you're drying it at an extremely cold temperature wow what a trip all right I get it now I get it all right so now we got we pony that was a tad a process something like that this came up rest us this morning and if I were to pressed it and immediately it would have not started waxing up I've got it we came up to the show it's starting to wax up a little which is fine it's just a little bit harder to collect right so we're I'm in here and that's gorgeous it is warm by the way the air conditioning broke they're fixing it up we just fell right yeah we had this in the freezer and I already pulled it apart and the cold temperatures a key to this know right even everything cold right yeah so it started tearing the wax of him that is impressive that's the starting material okay yeah so now what do we do it now that to me I'd be dabbing the [ __ ] out of that as a matter of fact so is that dabble yeah you want to try it yes yeah you know we've got these these are called a puff coke peak is that what this is yeah absolutely yeah awesome you showed up with one and guru showed up with one the beginning in a week and they really do hit beautifully I think so yeah it's my preferred way to smoke I was a double uh double press here Yeah right Yeah right see he already turned it on so oh no what your right hand I'll turn it off because these are cold start tabs always for you now I just changed it to you take this more damaged how you didn't even started up so you're doing alright beautiful I forgot it's the right temperature I like to do it on green I think if you have a high quality product if it should burn really well and hey yeah I'll shout out to Stony scholar who was teaching me about this at the last dvc cup and he was probably the first time I heard about cold start dabs Yeah right great once ready deal alright I'll get mine going to this I haven't tried this yet this is star dog I did a full spectrum start up here ok beautiful star dog is it's JJ from top dog is that right really so yeah alright so back from bubble hashes is gonna be the 45 of you for me 45 of you all the way to the 160 you I don't even know how what say you what do you you have it's the micron size of the bubble bag say use it oh sure I know about that sorry so both bags coming about half that you get half a dozen bubble bags they go anywhere from what about 30 or something like that 30 microns 25 micron yeah 20 yep right usually or 220 or 190 or contaminate bags and then your your 160 bag you have some really nice head to start in and get in there yeah what he means by that so that's ones you keep your ear material and your starting material bubble bags all right hang on excuse me let me date with the puff coke peak oh yes let me turn my own give me some small talk here so we're starting off with this and then what that goes in a jar tell me how we get to these I don't understand the jar we smoke the [ __ ] out by the way this is amazing hang on a second smells good I haven't tried it yet this is my new harvest I do everything in-house and you know in Colorado you're only allowed to do 12 plants so it's really hard to have material all the time yeah absolutely you can put air quotes around your 12 plants your church things very interesting know if I did it right I still got some left oh oh I better q-tip it is this gurus you could double click it if you didn't want oh I guess going yeah that should have done that and sometimes you could get sugar done the double click oh good thanks pretty interesting best tastes pretty pretty delicious [ __ ] great it's pretty much cold Karen right here that's what you have here so yeah so what I have no idea what's going on here so let's go for it we got what I would smoke right there what are we trying to make we're trying to make diamonds and sauce with it we're trying to that's one of the that's one of the consistencies you can make what are they tell me tell me what are their Jesus movie it's almost offensive right so this is grease monkey and I took a little cookie pucker from camerado and mixed it in with the grease monkey from exotic genetics okay kind of spiced up the Terps a little and made it a little Wow yeah it's interesting smell yeah Jesus it is weird man that's an interesting smell so okay so that starts with this yeah it starts with this and you have your option of collecting into a ball right you know you're gonna take all these and collect it into a big ball Drazen that's easy I done that yeah exactly and you're gonna put it in a jar and seal it okay you could have options you could go into an oven at a temperature around 220 degrees okay 45 minutes an hour and we'll go over that later just a simple of them like a toaster oven or some convection oven yeah perfection oven okay I used my oven in my kitchen when I first started here thousands of dollars of equipment so I guess you got a couple G's in the freezer freeze dryer yeah so freeze right in a bubble bags the good bubble bags are getting up there and prints really and I love those bubble bags I spent my last dime I was on vacation found out those existed and spent my last dime on them it's like I got this right all right so we got we get it uh like this now what we put a leg ball it up put it in a jar how the hell is a ball of that gonna make that that doesn't make no sense to me it's like I said oh okay they'll go into the oven right 20 degrees got it or about 45 minutes this jar is gonna melt up and it's gonna foam up and it's gonna start 2d carved in the jar essentially what you're doing is separating your using solvent as a using terpenes as a solvent you're separating THC and the terpenes got it terpenes will go to the top THC will settle the bottom that will go on a heat map and that will sit on a heat man anywhere from 12 hours to 24 hours and so far none of this is specialty equipment I've got a seed heating mat right there I used to sprout seeds and and make clones with yeah that's what you need yeah kitchen the kitchen of an oven and a seed mat is all you really need I mean if you know this is all very high-end product you're working with medical medical instruments as much as possible right if you have a nice clean Breville convection oven that you could get at Best Buy or bad bad thing yeah all right yeah but aside from the freeze dryer which you'll make a lot of friends with that at least no yeah a lot of folks come into the house oh yeah and so how long does something like this have to sit after so you you bake it and it's it's ready or you sit what you're gonna do is you're gonna take that jar and you're going to essentially turn it into a liquid and though though it's gonna foam up and the bottom will turn into a liquid the bubbles will start to rise up the jar kind of like a beer okay when is three-quarters of the way up the jar is all liquid on the bottom and the top are bubbles it'll look like a beard when it was freshly poured exactly right that's when it's ready to pull out of the oven you're gonna take that jar out of the oven and put it on a heat mat like that and it'll sit on that heat mat anywhere if I can set from 12 to 24 hours and it'll the crystals will start to collect and form and that's it and how long so after 24 hours it's good like that that's only a process I would think it would take weeks for yeah I remember making rock candy as a kid that shook took weeks man it could take anywhere from 12 hours to 4 days five days goddess I've ever seen a jar takers been six days and does it matter about the quality if there's not enough terpenes and in the material or it always work I've seen some jars not work absolutely right not every strain does work but for the most part if you have a good quality starting material you do your process right right you're gonna you're gonna have good results did you see this is [ __ ] cool cuz you can do it with a convection oven and just go over to nosies house man he just bought a kid you didn't you just buy your a freeze dryer brother yes loving it I'll be right over absolutely okay so what other consistencies do we have man you know the most popular consistency in my world right now and I think a lot of people are really digging on is a cold here which hold you here come on get us get us up to speed I told you I gotta go to the 7:10 cup the concentration celebration in a month maybe get my [ __ ] together man this is the cold care dude so show that to the camera man that is if they had that in the store I might run out with it I have to I'd have to think I have to conscience man that thing is uh insane how many grams is this first of all so that's one ounce 28 grams okay yeah that's fun that's fun to have in my hand so has it been whipped yet this I'm still caring okay how long is the Cure on something like that so this the first stop is there a cure on that you said one to four days is that what you're calling it cure so what I'm calling on that is the separation okay yeah you're separating the terpenes or the THC and forming crystals is that after the cure this is so Karen so this has been this foot into a ball right and put into a jar right that's it all I've done is take that collected and put it in the showcase I love it how long's that after how long does that cure so this has been in a jar now for two days okay I'm gonna let this sit in a jar for a few more weeks God okay that's what I was thinking I thought there was some stuff he did for a few weeks and that's room for 60 degrees for a few weeks the sweat get terpenes will start to rise to the top they'll get softer where do you keep a room sixty degrees if we're trying to be practical and helped a DGC actually do this so you just take a cold basement like a dresser drawer got it and it's in the 60s clothes or it has to be dialed in 60 degrees I would consider a six a cold Kyra's 60 degree room okay you could also do a room temperature here is just just fine and it goes quicker it works just fine okay no reason to not do a room temperature here I'm still obsessed over it why not brother yeah if I cure something up it'll be just a pocket cure yeah I call it yeah yeah a pocket cure pocket cure that sounds like something I would do and when you're ready when it's when it's secured and you feel you feel it it's good where you like it right it's sweating terpenes it looks delicious sweating to smoke yeah yeah you take care take your tool and you go ahead and whip it like mashed potatoes essentially what's that can you do that what's that look like right we'll do it to this one all right so this one is the same material that this was the second press material so we'll show that material first of all all right that's the second pressing it's [ __ ] impressive normally when I would do the second pressings or at least a second run with my bubble bags it was much it was a lot less quality can you say a lot less quality much lower quality that's limit to say manthe books I didn't mean it's kicking it I've never been known for the best grammar myself you can make great concentrates nobody gives a [ __ ] about your grammar yeah all right so this one thing about this is an ounce that's announcer there's 14 grams okay half an ounce an ounce looks like yeah beautiful I put this in the oven okay yeah so in order to speed this process up you could put it in the oven as well and do cake batters what a lot of people are called so that's when I goes I get that a batter sometimes yeah okay so my batter out of the oven is gonna come out dry like this it's this is unlit so what about this moist you do there's plenty of terpenes in there and it's delicious and you can smell it it just needs to be kind of whipped okay that's not a fast profile yeah you know I'm more of like a no-till guy man so this is kind of I don't know man right I know it's actually the same idea though you know you get everything exposed to a more surface area get it exposed Wow okay that's looking like something to get it at a dispensary yeah then you start smashing it down kind of potatoes that looks good you know misty all looks getting wet and delicious already and you know right look at that so Leo is soft and gooey beautiful show that to guru man yeah come on you really get a nice good mash on that you're welcome to stop by the bakery any time so so what consistencies is coming like I said this is the end this is a second press and I did put it in the oven just to speed up the process of the cold appear for the show oven will loosen terpenes I don't know I think you could bring out some terpenes well it depends on the strain you know some the oven will bring out terpenes on some strains of them will destroy starting really fragile terpenes and some strands as well huh yeah absolutely I like to do a little bit of both I wish that's my tournament entry so I'm just kind of like oh yeah they're like that I can't smell it yeah you know the press of that so you know you so the quality is there it's delicious you want to try it yes yeah you probably don't ask me that any other man let me see that let me see the whole jar I got that cheese man right I'm happy today it's a good day in the bakery nice limit limit let me hold let me know yes Jesus what strain is this what do you think hate the nausea will you put this all back in the fridge it's totally waxed up it's gonna be really hard to click now but yeah the key thing is cold cold is the key yeah it is colder the better you're working at home if you could turn on the air-conditioner or open up some windows if I live at elevation so I keep everything really cool does that make a difference oh yeah damn I try to keep miles at 60 you know like I'll let you handle it yeah you know I just I start making pizzas and I'll be damned you got a really a just [ __ ] for elevation I'm sure making that stuff that's way sensitive man you really got to adjust you're a mile high up makes a [ __ ] huge difference especially with water absorption I so dry yeah it's almost impossible to keep up yeah is there any difference if people are trying to do this in you know up in Portland where it's more humid or anything is there any kind of special precautions they would have to take well Portland's humid yes what I'm wondering is such a different client man yes so the probably was something somebody that actually lives in Portland to ask wouldn't it yeah I mean you want to keep bubble high school most people professionally love make pilaster live and work and walk-in coolers so this is all about a walk-in cooler this would never hit this temperature as a professional matchmaker yeah yeah so this for the show it would have never made it this long and started to wax up already right I would have collected that immediately put it in a jar you put it in the oven for Jam put it in a jar put in a cold room for a cold cure and now what's a jam what's a jam so the jam would be you know the the crackles that's why we call it jhanas okay okay I believe olio cause a jam 710 calls it premium rosin and I believe gotcha you know there's different companies call it different things so help me out with these pro companies it's because they're able to do things like by walk-in freezers I think I forgot must have forgotten to turn mine on I'm still trying to help you with that Scotty I'm still trying to get this thing what am I doing wrong it's gross I see him that's I'm on it yeah so you want to click it once I'll get once all right and then click it twice to get it going and concert vibrates you're ready to go all right I like it I like it it's pretty cool man let's see a couple of these at the at the 710 concentration celebration I'm gonna bring mine yeah I think it'd be a good way to hit them I mean how torches are cool but yeah this is a safe little bit and a little bit yeah couple hundred stoners with torches sounds cool that's then I hit my sword on my place yesterday I heard a lady I was reaching around trying to fold the back up of a piece of paper I'm sure and sure hit my plate my will templates not so low-temp what they're doing that dude I use a toaster for like five minutes a week and I burnt myself man all right so did you get yours yet uh not yeah I don't think it's ever vibrate uh I mean I was actually making small talks ah there we go man there we go that just turned off double-click that again it it sways boom boom there you go now good now you're I like this thing but what stop at the learning curve how come I'm the only wall to learning curve it's bold school job school study all these gadgets I took me a while to I got laughed at for not having a filter on my joint last week the filter gets in the way honestly kind of taste taste bad throws in anyway hey okay it's a double quick hit that's what it is all right cool man I think we actually did pretty good man I think we uh I think I learned some [ __ ] man you run out I want to see this guy definitely but I'm pretty stoked that you if you invest in a freeze dryer that's kind of you're good to go you can all sudden start making super high-quality extracts like this as long as you're growing super high quality weed y'all I think so I think the learning curve here would be a lot a lot less than making butane hash co2 hash any of those types of hash it's illegal as a [ __ ] is illegal but you know there's a lot to learn yeah there's a legal and then there's a legal yeah yeah you know in a legal lab it's a lot to learn isn't very what's your brand called again I know you got a hangout dialed in Terps man died on turbulent turkey diving terpenes and ER yeah this is some pretty cool [ __ ] you got Instagram yeah I'm an Instagram that's about interest on Instagram other than terpenes on Instagram all right we gotta hang out a little more man this is [ __ ] cool I learned to hold this is like opening up a new world to me I had no idea actually I didn't know this existed because I would see the six star hashes and all these all these crazy concoctions at the dispensary but I really didn't know what went into him or how they were made I love the fact that there's there's no external solvents into it this is just what the terpenes act as a solvent right yeah absolutely it's cool it's awesome so that's yeah you know making bubble hash water solvent carrying agent you using water and ice to break off the trichomes just the very heads of the little live flower and it's bad acid into this yeah it's badass I still think I'm doing this wrong but Jason thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for making the trek and extra show me how to use this thing well though it doesn't even seem like I put the carbon cap on at this point that in terms out intervenes over on Instagram [ __ ] with a match take it easy brother Thanks crack take it easy oh yeah [Music] little break [Music] [Music] yeah [Music] medicine [Music] [Music] today [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

wow I'm [ __ ] late", "txlLQHJoIHg": "what is up youtube alex here back again with another quick video that is of the orange cookies that i promised you i would do a video of g leaf orange cookies cured butter stats are on the front there what is it coming in at like uh i think it was 80 they said altogether it was even 80. this is g leaf hybrid eighty percent thc orange cookies is a cross between orange the strain orange juice and girl scout cookies now i haven't opened this up i saved it for our review because that's what i like to do i like to be just as surprised as you guys as to what's inside so without further ado orange cookies cured butter let's break this little seal here or maybe i'll just oh it pops open new jar clear bottom jar the other ones have the uh mirrored bottom but i think this is the newer the newer stuff has the clear bottom a nice looking butter there it is cured butter orange cookies by g leaf i'll do a couple dabs of this and let you know what i think even though i must admit i did do a couple dabs of the golden cobra about a 45 minutes ago so i am still a little tuned up from that but we're going to try some of this orange cookies by g leaf now i did pay 60 for this that's why i continue to buy g leaf and i will now i did have their straight lemonade peel and snap that was good the magic johnson x zuki's was good magic johnson on its own wasn't good didn't taste good i didn't care for the uh pineapple chunk they had i didn't care for that either by g leaf so i did like the magic johnson x zuki's and i did like the straight lemonade it was peel and snap but they also had that in a butter i think too now they had it in the butter got my new torch boom boom 497 the biggest five dollar lighter you will buy let's heat it up let you know what i think about this let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section on this friday i will be coming to you later on tonight with my pre-smackdown live stream that i've been doing i think i'm going to continue to do that since it's getting uh i don't know people seem to like it yeah so orange cookies not too much of a smell it's got a little bit of a citrus smell to it coming off of it now orange juice uh i'm not sure if that's a hybrid or a sapiva to strain orange juice but girl scout cookies is a hybrid set my timer you guys know i like setting the timer yeah let's see if it says any kind of weight one gram it's packaged on 8 3 20 20. it's got harvest batch number expires weight package packager id a lot of them have that so you know if something's missing or not in here you know if this was empty or something they know exactly what person heisted it from the factory all right cheers hope this is good tasting orange cookies that is good i'm glad that's got a i'm nice mostly the orange it's got a nice orange like citrusy but it tastes good so i'm pleased yeah so the orange cookies butter tastes good like i said with g leaf it's kind of like hit and miss because a lot of their well it's kind of like 50 50 it seems like of their stuff not tasting good kenpai og did not taste too good pineapple chunk did not taste too good magic johnson did not taste too good so magic johnson x zuki's did taste good straight lemonade peel and snap did taste good and now the orange cookies butter did taste good so we're at a 50 50 right now with in my book for g leaf but for sixty dollars a gram it's the cheapest stuff on the menu right now unless they get some terrapin in now terrapin seems like it's a little more flavorful their product is but i don't know it's this is like right with terrapin stuff but let's do another dab of this orange cookies cured butter and we'll go from there let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what's going on in your neighborhood while we do this next dab now wrap this video up i don't want to make it too long try to keep them under 10 minutes yeah that's that was tasty i'm happy about that so now i know when i go back like what's strange to buy that i liked it said i won't buy that pineapple chunk no more it was pineapple chunk crumble and i probably won't buy the kenpai or for sure the magic johnson that was the worst case we won they all had good their potency was there the medical quality i guess of the medicinal quality was there but just the flavor wasn't there for those strains you could hear me over the torch yeah the medicinal quality was there on the g leaf products i mean it got you the effects and you know but a lot of them i said the taste the flavor wasn't there but they're coming out with all kinds of stuff they had shatter they had orange cookies in the shatter and the butter and the crumble i think but i like like i said you guys know i like the butters is my favorite butters the butter is my favorite so let's get a nice dab on there with this orange cookies nice dab on there and cheers timer cheers yeah nice as you've seen that was a cloud big hit nice orange citrus taste i really don't taste i guess you don't taste the girl scout cookies but it's got a nice citrusy taste to it so i like that happy secured butter orange cookies by g leaf extracts little clear jars i like that like i said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section i will let you know more about what i thought about this down in the descriptions also

comes in bottles comes in pouches if you enrolled with a premium starter kit you got a couple of these to sample and if you're brand new if you're enroller didn't tell you yet let me share with you that these are best when they're cold so I would stick them in the fridge and I'm getting nice and icy cold and then enjoy them you can drink it straight or you can add it to water you can add it to juice and I like to mix mine with a little bit of zing periodically for a little extra kick and that is just a great treat we're going to talk a lot more about what it does but that's our focus for tonight so I am going to hop over here real quick and and do a screen share with you all right so um in your back office right now we have a wonderful new learning opportunity that is called Young Living University and Young Living University is an opportunity for you to learn from the comfort of your own home so here's the great news you guys this PowerPoint is an available to all of us if you are a member if you're not a member yet once you become one this PowerPoint will be here for you but you can use this PowerPoint to teach a class you can just use it to sit down and learn about things yourself but they are very very informative okay so let's go ahead and get started and make sure red we like to call this whole body nutrient infusion it is by far one of young livings most popular wellness supplements so I always say that if it's tough to get your kids or yourself to remember to take supplements and vitamins every day this is the easiest thing to do because it's kind of like drinking a liquid vitamin it's a nutrient-rich drink that's infused with antioxidant providing super fruits and powerful essential oils so of course everything from Young Living has essential oils in it make sure red contains vital nutrients that may be missing or low in many modern diets and it could be a key to experiencing abundant wellness and most importantly energy so it's the perfect way to start your day make sure red if you haven't tasted it or you maybe it's been a little while since you've tried it here's what you need to remember what you need to tell people at your classes when you're sharing example it has a sweet tangy flavor okay it is not tomato based I just did a couple of classes yesterday and I know I saw the look on a couple of women's faces at one of the classes when we searched the samples and they were kind of like oh I'm not sure but it really does have a great fruity sweet flavor so it's infused with some of our favorite citrus oils it is crafted with super fruits and essential oils making it a powerhouse nutrient infusion that will support your overall health and wellness and supports normal eye health as well so if your vision is something that you are wanting to support make sure red should definitely be at the top of your list it's made with exotic fruit extracts and the whole fruit of young livings exclusive nation wolf berries which are very very high in antioxidants nature red provides energy and vitality throughout the day it is definitely delicious all by itself but you can also add it to lots of other fruits or smoothies other beverages you could add it to I've seen people make salad dressing out of it for gummies you can see those pictured I think there's a recipe actually coming up where they prepped the gummies highlighted so there's all sorts of fun things that you can do with your names red alright make sure red energizes it fortifies and it replenishes the body and mind with a proprietary blend of pure essential oils and wolfberry a known provider of antioxidants other vitamin rich super fruits and make sure read supply the body with vital antioxidants and also phytonutrients or a whole body nutrient infusion while helping prevent oxidative stress so we talked and we talked a lot about antioxidants and whoops sorry about that and what that actually means so let's let's dig in just a little bit deeper here okay antioxidants and our nutrients such as vitamins minerals and enzymes that help fight off the damaging effects of free radicals the body experiences a natural phenomenon called oxidation every day so it's just kind of part of our aging process okay if left uncontrolled these free radicals can damage cells much like the chemical reaction that takes place when a half-eaten Apple turns from free radical damage can be accelerated by pollution stress toxins smoking and alcohol so that is a huge reason and that we drink this so let's talk a little a little bit more about our antioxidant balance so this offers a broad spectrum of antioxidants and phytonutrients and antioxidants are very beneficial for optimal health but you don't need high amounts of any one antioxidants no matter how powerful it is to create the strongest defense against free radicals the body needs an array of many different antioxidants we've got to have that variety okay the key to optimal support is balance just as a healthy diet consists of a variety of fruits and vegetables antioxidant supplementation also needs to come from a variety of sources to support optimal health make sure red offers a range of antioxidants that supports the entire body this balanced approach to antioxidant supplementation is why so many people experience vitality energy and vigor when they start using this product so here are some special things about mingsha red it contains balanced ingredients that make it a whole body nutrient infusion for health and wellness this is a big one it supports normal cellular function okay so you can Google cellular function and what happens when that goes wrong that's kind of the key to to our health so we want to keep our body on the track of normal healthy cellular function okay it contains powerful ingredients that are involved in natural antioxidant processes supports overall good health and wellness we talked about supporting healthy eye and vision function it delivers citrus oil containing the limonene there's another key word that would be good to google and find out what d lightning does in our body it utilizes a powerful formula that includes wolfberry which is touted it's health benefits and most importantly it helps prevent against that oxidative stress all right so let's dive into the story of Ningxia red okay we kind of understand now why it is so important for our body and what it can do inside of us but oftentimes we don't talk about how this came about so I think that this is pretty interesting here so let's see in 1993 our founder Gary Young met with a Chinese scientist dr. Chow and it was dr. Chow that introduced the wolfberry which has been a prized treasure in China for thousands of years a paid he explained that the people who regularly consume this berry we're leading remarkably long healthy lives and this stuck out to Gary young as he was kind of surveying populations all around the world he wanted to know why these people were living so long and were so involved gary became convinced that the super fruit needed to be made available to the world and hence now we have negative wolfberries which is awesome so gary combined the wolfberry with pure essential oils creating the world's foremost functional beverage which we call ninja red Young Living is proud to offer the only nutrient drink on the market that combines the Chinese wolfberries with pure essential oils into a single beverage that tastes as good as it is good for us so looking specifically at some of the primary ingredients in ningxia red let's talk about what's in it so first we're going to talk about the super fruit may the wolfberry this is really the hero of the whole thing okay next we're going to cover the benefits of the essential oils that are included in it and then we're going to look at the supporting juice blend each part of nation red is crucial to combine and make this drink so let's take a look at the wolfberry portion because that is that's kind of a big deal here okay so nation red contains the puree from the whole nation wolfberry known as goji berries we use all of the valuable parts we use the juice we use the peel the seeds and fruit to ensure that each bottle contains the optimal blend of nutrients offered by this extraordinary fruit so our wolfberry comes from the Ningxia province in northern China where it has been revered for centuries it contains every essential amino acid and contains 13% protein did you know that that is the highest protein content of any fruit I think that is awesome and if you're if you're one that is trying to increase your protein intake but you don't necessarily want to do it with an animal-based product a meat you want to stick to more of a vegan or plant-based diet this is an absolutely wonderful way to get some additional proteins ongoing research continues to support the wolf berries health promoting properties young living works directly with Chinese vendors to grow wolf berries in locations that are rigorously tested for pesticides heavy metals and other potential contaminants once the wolf berries are harvested they are cleaned and set off to be pureed the wolfberry puree is the core ingredient in ningxia red young living uses the whole fruit wolfberry puree to maintain as many benefits as possible I absolutely love to see these pictures from China because I think that the berries are just so beautiful and and it's so exciting to know that we're getting the whole portion of that fruit so a typical serving size of Ning so red is about one to two ounces and as you can see there on this slide says it takes 14 grams of Ningxia wolfberries to make one serving of Ningxia red so I know a lot of us probably drink more than one to two ounces but when you're getting started you will find a significant health and energy difference just starting with one or two ounces all right let's talk about some more of the ingredients that are in Ningxia so focusing on the essential oils make sure red also uses essential oils of course another distinctive feature of this unique product so the oils that are included in this drink are tangerine orange yuzu and lemon all containing rich and powerful D limonene and limonene these oils enhance the flavor of every bottle of Ningxia red these pure and potent essential oils blend synergistically and deliciously with the other components of Ningxia to support total body wellness no other nutrient infused beverage can come close for the beneficial essential oil content of ningxia red and of course if you like um you know some of the other citrus oils you'll see if a if you've been to convention you'll see that in the in the red club where they have the nature red bar people are always adding other oils just to kind of get a different flavor so you might want to add drop of peppermint or you may enjoy adding more orange or more lemon or something like that some people put in copaiba or frankincense it's all kind of depending on what effect you're going for all right some other ingredients in Vinci let's focus on the fruit blend so nature it contains many nutrient-dense fruits in addition to the wolfberry it also has aronia blueberry cherry pomegranate and plum together they provide a wide spectrum of antioxidant activity that will energize fortify and replenish your body these fruits are naturally high in bio flavonoids and phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and low Z Z X Finn I do not know how to pronounce that word I'm not going to lie we'll we'll talk about that one later and each are a powerful tool to help prevent against that oxidative stress so the juice concentrates outside of the Ningxia wolfberry those are all sourced from the United States alright so this is when it gets really fun because I definitely want to make sure that I am consuming enough produce every day but it can be a lot of work to eat the nutritional equivalent of everything that is contained in nature red so if you can envision a measuring cup one cup of Ningxia red would be the nutritional equivalent of eating four cups of grapes one cup of wolfberries five whole cherries a half a cup of blueberries seventy five pomegranate seeds a half a plum and 1/4 of a cup of aronia berries so take all of those lend them together put them through your juicer and that's that's basically the quantity that you're getting in one cup of Ningxia read this portion I think is really important there are no high fructose sweeteners in nature red and there is no added sugar so it is sweetened with a bit of stevia extract 1 cup of mingsha red contains 2 servings of fruit and again we've mentioned earlier but the daily recommended serving is 1 to 2 ounces so stevia in case that is a new a new one for you I'm guessing most of you have probably heard of that probably have it in your kitchen cupboard but stevia is a natural zero calorie sweetener that is about 300 times sweeter than sugar it allows for a delicious beverage with overall lower sugar and calorie content all right some other interesting facts about nation red nation red utilizes a high temperature flash pasteurization young living users flash pasteurization for Ningxia and this means that the juice is exposed to heat for about 30 seconds or less standard pasteurization can be several minutes of heat and has been shown to highly degrade the nutritional aspects of the juice and the wonderful sensory aspects like the flavor and the color we also take extra steps to keep the juice moving through a closed system that allows the process to be extremely monitored and prevent any part of the juice to remain hot for too long lastly we employ a cooling tunnel right after the pasteurization that cools the juice as quickly as possible this step is not required but it reduces cooking time and it preserves the nutrients sodium benzoate is a naturally-occurring preservative in plants they use it to protect their fruit from going rancid if we didn't put sodium benzoate in this product we would not be able to provide ningxia read at all so it ensures a 24 month shelf life protects the benefits of Ningxia and it keeps it free from naturally occurring microorganisms so here are the nutritional facts at a glance so again we've got roughly 12 servings in a bottle so each of the bottle is 25 point 3 5 fluid ounces and 25 calories in a serving about 6 grams of carbohydrates less um less than a gram of dietary fiber 5 grams of sugar and 35 milligrams of sodium I bet that most of you have already figured this out but make sure red is best when it's served cold we do encourage you to shake it whether it be in the bottle or in the packet because that wolfberry puree is kind of thick it will settle so it's good to shake it here's a little tip that I have found works great when you if you order the bottles store your case of Ningxia read upside down and open it from the bottom so that that all of the puree is in the top of the bottle and then when you take it out and you put it in your refrigerator at least at that point you know it's stirring up if it's settled here it will have stirred that up so that's what we usually do or if you lay it on on their side you know in a pantry I've seen some people that have a little wine refrigerator and it's basically neasha red bottles in there that works fantastic and but the idea is just to shake those up real well before you break them alright and this is just kind of a good um wrap up slide for wet ninja red does for you and at this point if you're on a computer I would love for you to type in the chat box what are some of the health benefits that you have experienced from drinking things to red and if you're on your phone that may be a little trickier but I would love to hear from some of you because we have seen tremendous results now because we always keep our Thursday night lives compliant we can't go into anything that is not FDA compliant but you can sure share with us you know some of the general things that you have noticed about the benefits of this and let us know how long you have been drinking it so our family we enrolled in Young Living in the fall of 2007 and I would say it was probably within a year it wasn't right away for us but probably within the first year our family started drinking this on a daily basis it did not take us long to realize that we definitely wanted to be on essential rewards if we were going to be ordering things to read for our family of five every week the essential rewards is by far the best value if you get some of the nation red er kits that's a great deal and then of course the more bottles that you buy at a time the lower the price per ounce drops now I will share one other little tip with you on July 8th when we have our rally we are going to be having make sure red for sale at least that's the hope here that was the primary product that we requested because it's so heavy and it increases your shipping rates so please come and join us for the rally and you can stock up on your nature read there and you don't have to worry about the extra shipping if you did not get a ticket and you would still like to come and purchase product we are going to be able to allow you to do that as well so you can check out the details on the location of the rally the one here in central Iowa where we are going to have young living corporate come with the product it will be in Ankeny so we would love to have you come and see us alright so make sure read um as we just talked about I should have advanced the slide one more time but you can save about thirty dollars when you put in each the Nisha read kit on your essential rewards order the nature read kit includes four bottles so you get a four pack of the big bottle and then you get 30 of the pouches okay and you can say in about thirty dollars if you get it in that collection so you guys one of the things that I always encourage you is as you are sharing young living with other people keep their welfare in mind and let them know how the smart people buy their products so first of all nobody would pay retail right that's kind of a given but let them know if they really do love the nice read or if they really need the health benefits definitely share with them that purchasing this on essential rewards is by far the best value all right we are on our last slide here and this is a fantastic recipe for neisha berry creamsicles so this might be a fun one to try just for these hot summer days if you want a refreshing treat that you can keep in the freezer it's simply a cup of nation red a cup of organic vanilla yogurt and a cup of your favorite fresh or frozen fruits throw all of that in a blender blend it up and just pour it into your popsicle molds kids will eat these up like crazy and I bet the see adults will as well and I'm sorry I was thinking that the the ningxia gummy recipe was at the end of this one I was just reading that one somewhere else I will be posting the recipe for the gummies on the Thursday night live page so that you can see those all right so we are going to wrap up and we'll wrap up the recording here if you would like to hang around and chat for just a bit ask questions answer questions I want to hop back over to the zoom page so that I can see your comments that you have been making you are welcome to stick around otherwise and I also have a special message for everybody that's on the call that is part of the health wise heroes team so hang on for that and so thank you for joining us", "zCefsDMbWUo": "[Music] hey everybody so check it out for this review video I figured it would be awesome to do it outside alright man it's a beautiful day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just they're trying to be your buddy be their buddy follow them on Facebook and Instagram so you could stay updated with all the product they got all right and the different flavors and everything just everything amazing about buddies all right guys if you

had a hit up rise you know I like to hit him up on the Friday and grab me some African tide number 15 dry resin now I have did this this is my second look at this strain because I did I did have the wax before it's a little bit back but it wasn't dry resin I think it was just a wax this is a dry resin I paid 60 bucks for this today for the one gram it is a sativa you know it's one of my favorites sativas I got my dab tools here got my rig got my water it's lunchtime it's 12:45 and I'm ready for my lunchtime break here so uh seals on marriage of the sea I've got the seal busted open to see what this African tie is about you said I did have African tie before and it was really good it's really good daytime cerebral you know focus mind that type of thing notice it says dry resin so I'm expecting it to be and it's got those little things on the top of them smooth there's no plastic seals you get this open it's already halfway open it's different it's says it's dry but this looks like a sugar wax it's a real wet looking exactly the opposite it's real wet up there in the corner and yes it is a grand just it's all piled in the corner now prime did this last time and I had a few comments of people saying they didn't look like a gram yeah it was a gram it's all piled in the corner there it's a big goop there it says dry resin though but this looks like a sugar wax to me applicant and number fifteen dry resin gel now don't look like a dry resin to me you see the terpene profile there it's got a nice turf profile it's got a nice smell kind of lime ish I think the prom most prominent one would be mercy and it says then the beak arm up I can't even say these names Lima leaves got 1.61 that's what I'm smelling yeah look at that very nice sugar white sugar wet that's what it looks like to me they called it dry resin unusual I was expecting it to be like like it's like that tha see tha sea sand now I did have that recently I bought the sunset sherbert THCA sand and that's just like Florida white beach sand real hard to scoop up and deal with but it was alright I just recently had a half grand with that I did not do an interview I mean an interview a review of it like I said I don't review all the products I use I do review most of them go but yeah I had dad the sunset sherbet by Moxie was 50 for the half grand but yeah this was only 60 for the whole brand so let's get a dab of this prime after get tired number 15 I'm going to put a scoop on here I also have my puffs go around here somewhere but I'm gonna throw a nice a dab on the end of there you see that there you gotta focus on maybe a more nice scoop you throw another one on this other dab tool nice yet it's like sugar wax it's really wet and it reminds me of a sugar wax surprise it says dry resin I said I was really expecting it to be like that tha sea sand type texture but let's get it go and got a new torch - this is my old one that's dying here I'd like to get all the all the blue what I can out of it fuel out of it but it is dying let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comment section I know I haven't done a review in a while you see all the heat coming off of that is blurring my face but yeah I haven't done a video in a minute just been chilling so I figured out it's Friday I like to get videos on Friday and I will do a video lunchtime and little African Thai get me going see this all down you got my timer ready [Music] yeah like I said let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let's get this nice and hot [Music] little music copyright free music for you CFM 20 seconds is my timer from the time I heat this up nice and red hot and burn off all the other [ __ ] usually I give it about 40 seconds and then I dab [Music] will do this one first that's so that's a fatty told me that's a fat one right there that's a Gooper yep eighty five point nine two percent or as of nine nine second nine to eighty five point nine two percent CHCA so I've got to crunch those numbers I'll let you know what it is down in the description yes very nice yeah thca as I've been telling you guys I'm if I'm the only one telling you this that when it says THCA it's in an acid state you're not getting the full amount that it says on the package you're getting eight point seven seven percent of that whole amount so you multiply whatever that amount of THC a is by zero point eight seven seven and then you'll have your THC amount of course you would add in whatever th see it has this doesn't have any THC at all just the THC a I don't know if I'm the only person telling you guys about that but this is true always check it so the higher THC a of course is gonna be better because you got to drop it down a little bit now this is probably going to be 85 it's probably gonna be like I could do it right now for you why not do it right now calculator so you take eighty five point nine nine let's just I can't Holly see up close eighty five point nine nine times zero point eight seven seven equals seventy five point four percent THC that's what this is seventy five point four percent all right let me do another dad for you eight minutes just do another dad I don't want to make it more than 10 minutes yeah that tasted really good like a little lemon ish with a little earthiness to it but really nice usually I do about about 4 dabs as my magic dad number I would say let me know how many dabs usually do two three four five six sometimes I do do six seven I've done six and seven dabs before put some stuff and been a rock but then pain free and all that good stuff also I take this stuff for pain anxiety and depression mostly mostly pain I got a bad back with a bad hip so and I had cancer so it's like cancer prevention medication - yeah time to change my torch also taking a long time to eat this up it's almost dead five bucks that's what I pay for these big blue cans five dollars each they probably last you know meat about two weeks to a month depending on how hard of daven instead of buying those little tiny torches they sell for 25 30 bucks a butane they'll last you about a week [Music] yeah let's go change that torch to 40 seconds can we dad yeah it said let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know how everything's been going let me know if you've tried African tie before this is my second look at African tie for this channel I said we did have a first look which I think it was it was whack just have to can't I wax this is number 15 dry resin then it looks more like a sugar wax did you do another look at that let me move it around for you piled in the corner she wants to fall out the jar it's like a blog it reminds me of what they call a blonde wax [Music] [Music] [Music] nice very tasty yeah I moved it I moved it from the corner of that of the jar hopefully don't fall out [Music] it's really a light color like a white [Music] it doesn't mind you they're blonde wax I'm gonna do another one but I ain't gonna do it on camera let you guys go you're not a dab tool you can see how light of a color it is want to focus on this like I said it's not good it's gonna keep focusing on me yeah there it is it's really a light colored wax oh there you go really light colored almost like a white sugar they called it dry resin for some reason it is dry this resin so I guess they're technically right all right guys I'm gonna wrap this video up we're at 13 minutes it's a little bit longer than I wanted it to be but yeah this is african thai number 15 dry resin sativa I'm feeling it coming on right now I'll let you know more about what I thought down in the descriptions but I had this before and it's excellent it's excellent and the feelings it's excellent in the medicate medicinal for pain and stuff in depression you guys have a good weekend it said and uh thanks for thanks for joining me for this 13 minutes and 45 seconds", "ftGpgG-TOrQ": "[Music] what's up y'all p2 peeps and i got a little headband on me today oh bandana this is actually a bandana from the alive and kicking brand i don't know if y'all could kind of see it it says you can see a lot right there but i'll you know put a little picture of the brand up there oh of course i don't know the video will be out by then but we do have some jarred cbg flower from them so that will be coming uh soon but we aren't discussing that today today we're talking about the newest buddy cart buddies cartridge that i pretty much got today tried out a lot today and um i've been liking it a lot so far this is headband and field cookies make sure that focus is in right there come on there we go i think it's getting it now yeah so it's about 93 total cannabinoids this is a hybrid strain eighty-nine percent thc not too many terps on this one only about three percent terms mostly miracin ossi osamine and karyophyllene um but yeah you know this is i think my third uh buddy's distilling cartridge but before i talk more about it let's just go ahead and take a hit y'all i hope everyone out there can join me for this one cheers foreign you know we gotta take a blinker for the first hit but yeah so much like all the other buddies you know distill it with cannabis derived terpenes cart this does still have a good amount of flavor despite only having three percent of terpenes um generally with buddies cartridges at least with the liquid diamonds ones i'm used to seeing eight to fifteen percent um it's been a while since i've had a cdt when you know this lit with cannabis derived terpenes um so i can't really speak too much on that the last one i believe i had was like four percent uh terpene profile so pretty flavorful um still and even with this you know this isn't the most flavorful but it's definitely better than your average dislike card for sure excuse me sorry you just can't really go wrong with these buddies cards you know for about 40 bucks out the door 45 bucks and in some places you can find them for 30 bucks this is incredibly worth the price um buddies has always been giving me you know that bang for your buck kind of vibes and um you know you definitely get that with what you would what you buy here uh i was gonna get a liquid diamond cart but uh this time around i just didn't really feel like it i just was like you know i want to save some money so let's go ahead and give something else a go and uh you know i'm obviously never really disappointed with buddies so yeah i mean i can't really say obviously sorry my display screen was getting messed up but i can't really say obviously but you know buddies is nowadays one of my favorite and more trusted brands so yeah one second three two one sorry y'all uh i had to do something real quick but yeah that's mostly what i got to say about buddies this car specifically we're getting a little sweetness there no tang or limeyness at all um but mostly like a sweeney kind of kind of uh actually there is a tang but i feel like that's just kind of like from uh the distillate oil itself let me get another hit here for you guys and double check that no no tang it's just sweet um i'd say a little tart maybe a little tart maybe like a berry kind of sweet but yeah those are most of the flavor profiles i get from that one and uh yeah okay cut that arm stretch thing okay three two one that's about all i can say about this one if you guys did like the video please like comment subscribe all that good stuff uh no cut back okay i cut cut all the way back three two one thank you guys for watching if you did enjoy this

three pieces of egg three eggs bread and butter with a serving of sausage link and some hot sauce Oh in Sultan pepper so here's always talking about coz rib eyes are eating fine right now oddly enough and not so much meat so I've got five rib eye steaks that's been soaking in this gunk all night looks like gun but it's actually olive oil parsley minced onion chopped chives a little bit of jalapeno some chili powder cuz I like it a little bit spicy and then a vinaigrette let me show it to you real fast all right so this is the vinaigrette that we bought it's an Italian classic classic Italian test maze test amaze pantry I'm gonna see if I can't hone in on these boards here so anyway it shouldn't hurt anything I did use a little bit in a salad I had yesterday and then I put some of it in a bag that that ziplock bag that was the stakes for soaking in I guess I'm having me a side pallet as I cook dinner because it was noshing on the pork skins and I was gonna have a salad with my dinner anyway so I use this Italian vinaigrette and I call it vinaigrette because it doesn't say that but it's primarily gotta be vinegar that's the biggest taste in this having steak with no a1 no no steak sauce I did for some of that Italian vinaigrette on it I poured some more Italian vinaigrette on this salad only one way to find out if that messed with me or not no we'll just have to say it a minute so later in the evening we had some leftover steak so I decided to go for round two hubby did too but he had ranch instead of the Italian seasoning dressing that I had medium you might we'll say I'm gonna go a bit much I'm not but I think I've had about 20 ounces of steak today I'm not real sure but about 20 ounces you guys calories and macros for yesterday fourteen hundred and sixty-three calories fourteen grams of total car 111 grams of fat 112 grams of protein but she baby pretty good kiddo day nothing wrong with it I got one more color these are just for fun but I really enjoy doing them and I love owls and country scenery so this is my birthday for my coloring for the day it's gonna start on another one yesterday I realized this video the sound quality is not that great because we were outside next time I do a video outside I will definitely speak up a lot louder but it is a whole lot less distracting and not as good a video but enjoy anyway well yeah you sure gotta love the south and a big yard no telling can I judge your staying back here we cleaned out a building yesterday and it's all going to the dump I can't see what y'all can see cuz yeah Suns in my eyeballs anyway yesterday was a pretty great kid it was a pretty good day all together there's a dog in the room I think they're always I tell you I couldn't imagine being constantly another dog anyway yo so yesterday was a wonderful day oh we did a whole lot of work a lot got accomplished today not so much so far I mean except for the house getting clean like it normally does but I don't think we're gonna do anything today I do have to venture out to get some trash bags I have no choice big family lots of garbage cannot let it lay around so yeah I have to venture out and get that everybody excited to go out and get trash bags hey I have a major obstacle victory so um well if I should really explain all that you anyway we had some really small bathing suits down in the buildings I pulled them out yesterday and I was like well they're really small and they put a really small person so but I'm gonna go ahead and wash them and try them on cuz you know I can't really afford hi honey better is she afraid can you see okay well that's our daughter Zoey bear anyway I decided to pull him out and wash them and dry them and see if they fit they all fit and they're baggy on my butt they're baggy on my butt so it's it's wild for me that these fit me now and I'd never would have thought about it before I never would have even thought to try them on before so it's really kind of cool not sure I'll have anywhere to go this summer to wear a bathing suit but hey we got a river back yonder that I'm getting in that muddy river but we got one hi Abby oh my goodness don't y'all start in front of this camera this is my dad's little dog my daughter's little dog I have a lab all I have is a little heifer door retrievers much affection okay honey they're right in the wild there's no telling which critters are gonna show up next fat Chihuahua all right so honestly this this one is the old one she's honey bears mama and the lab is the daddy and that's what they said anyway I couldn't even explain it all puppies and the kids falling over the puppies and they keep the puppies the mama don't have no sense to say no more puppies and it's just kind of how it goes anyway guys so today's gonna be a lazy day all but the adventure to go get the trash bags we've been doing pretty good with being cooped up family I mean for the most part we have been able to go out and drive around we live way out in the country so nobody cares what we do really we can get outside the house and as you can see sitting the Sun if we want to or sit in the shade it is the southern dream basically I get here Abbi I hear VT but he's over there he's not bothering us although we probably are sitting on some flowers you might want them see I got distracted by the dogs I'm sorry y'all everybody here oh I showed them well I'm not I haven't showed you yet I gotta weigh in that's where I show you the off scale victory because it's kind of cool oh oh oh what did you want to talk about everybody around here is kind of sick we've got everything from ear aches to sore throats to sneezing coughing hacking wheezing my mother of course still has pneumonia it went away and came back they put her on some more medications they did do a test for it to see if it was you know that one thing and we don't know yet it hasn't came back I don't think so she hasn't had a fever at all just I kind of developed pneumonia out of nowhere but she has a lot of lung issues and stuff so it could just be seasonal crap that caused it but for me yesterday I am suffering a little more from sinuses and allergies and I was because we've been out in the building and everything cleaning not only we in the pollen it's a breezy day with the pollen we're cleaning out the dirty dusty building I felt like I was covered in fine grains of sand yesterday did you feel dirty yesterday I did I felt dirty all over but it is um server night my sinuses really clogged up and stopped up on me and usually that's a sign of being kicked but I do have seasonal allergies especially if I get out in the Sun and stuff and and in the weather but it's nice and peaceful and quiet out here except for the little dogs right you know which they're not really hurting nothing they just want attention all right so I'm gonna go ahead and weigh in I was a little concerned about that Italian dressing but I had a ton of that yesterday and by a ton I mean more than I should because imported on my salad then I poured it over top of my steak and then we had round two of the salad mistake it was good we got like this much left in that bottle and I the majority of it so I was a little scared not only does it have quite a bit of calories from fat in it it has no no carbs though but quite a bit of calories from fat but it just have a lot of seasoning and spices so you just never know quite what could affect you however I can now pretty pretty active accurately say that the day before the slate the stay in the same was from the a1 from the steak sauce it's not really a one its we're cheap it's great value could have been a minor - maybe but I ate a ton of that yesterday yeah it looks like it was gonna affect me at all it would have so anyway let's go and get to the weigh-in step on the scale you guys that's enough skill victory - I used to have to hold my phone at 169 all righty then so I went down one pound yesterday I waited in it 170 on the dot for the last two days in fact and today 169 on the dot so I'm very pleased with that I still don't know if my coffee experiments working I won't be able to tell till I get to my lowest and go down I won't be able to tell you know what all is really affecting me we'll see well just tell us you had it back in right because it could just be you making small mistakes here and there in stress now even with the I was going on you really not stressed I'm really not right now um there are some stresses for us it's not so bad for us I think as it is for other people we're used to being broke that's not a big deal we're used to being kind of downhill at work yeah he's still going to work they have shortened his hours but he still going to work all the kids still have their jobs for right now I'm more stuck at home than I used to be you know I would get out and just spend two or three hours a goodwill or something like that just to get out of the house but it changes you don't get her free time as much right that's why she feels like he's a little bit worried cuz she's stuck in the house with the kids 24/7 but you know what I gotta be honest with you because I did if somebody did ask me a question what would I do if I was all alone in this life like if I didn't have any family around go crazy no actually I don't think I would I mean I she asked me this through email my brain just started working on salt salt salt I would FaceTime the hell out of people especially my kids now I'm blessed to have them right here with me and not away from me during this so that we don't have to quarantine apart I mean it's also kind of a curse cuz the point of us get that we're all getting it but at the same time it is a blessing because there's never a dull moment you ready never alone around here ever never alone before this stuff happened certainly not alone now but I mean I wouldn't face time the hell out of people especially my kids and grandkids you know if you're lucky enough to have them I would do a whole lot of social media interaction chat stuff like that you don't read it read a whole bunch of stuff and I would turn that music up in that house and let it blare while I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and decluttered and decluttered and decluttered because that's nice to do sometimes it makes you feel really good and accomplished to get rid of a whole bunch of crap that you didn't need it's just missing your house up so I think you know I think I would be okay although I'm glad that I'm not in that situation but I do understand some of you are this one lady hurt her her daughter is quarantined with her three children that are roughly Athena's that Athena Anthony and Zacks age her husband is quarantine abroad or away from her apparently his job you know keep some away or whatever so she's stuck at home with those three kids let me tell y'all some deforesters so I had Anthony's the Athenians that kind of all on my own he was in the house but he he don't know what to do about it anyway Athena screamed like something bitter so I jumped up and grabbed her and I guess that scared Anthony he started screaming and he was free in the house so he was climbing me while I'm holding Athena and he's screaming to and I'm like holy crap exactly just looking at me like he went it better when it was just me grandma but it's okay because I made it through I finally got both of them calm down buzzing oh Lord so yeah I definitely feel for her and I feel for anybody who's all alone too in this unless you like being all alone if you do hey that's a great thing you hear the gunfire I don't know if y'all can hear it we're way out in the country they're not shooting at us or towards us we can shoot

Kady my heavy um he's been doing kudos it's about October 4th but he's seen all the crap I've gone through and talked to him about everything Akito asks so he knows some some things right I know more than she thinks I do okay sir anyway I know as much as you allow me to know that's pretty much true his stomach's making noises y'all might hear that because he won't let me go eat I have a stress test tomorrow so I have got the biggest headache that you can possibly imagine and I have had it all day cuz I can't have no caffeine I give him caffeine if he stops and then you add on the fact that I haven't been getting my calories and a month I've been tired all day I try to feed you try harder he just don't like chicken chicks good okay yeah what I like to know like I'm just let's get to this article yeah what's it called news about where's it posted is science alert I mean this title is this thirty on nearly half a million people has bad news for the keto diet by Hilary Burt Business Insider February 8 2019 so this year the scientists and dietitians are starting to agree on a recipe for a long healthy life it's not sexy it does it involve fancy pillows or pricy diet potions fill your plate with plants including vegetables whole grains healthy fats in your gimmies against the goons don't include a lot of meat milk or highly processed foods that a gardener or farmer wouldn't recognize me there's absolutely nothing more important for your health then we eat each and every day a cartilagenous of nutrition researcher at Burnham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Business Insider okay so it sounds to me like this cardiologist is more preaching more preaching vegan or vegetarian yeah what she discovered and what is probably not a huge surprise is that no matter where you live and what your daily diet is like banning entire food groups and thinking you can cheat your way to a good healthy might work for a while but it could also send you into a your early grave freeze right okay that said there's something I wanted to say about it but I forgot cuz he was reading and I forgot read it again yeah she discovered Oh an entire food group doesn't those carbohydrates are not a food group they're not a necessary essential for your body there's no such thing as an essential carb which means you don't need them they're not a food group they're just they're not their foods reads things we create and make we still made them medicinal Corinth is food it's not a food group it's not an essential food no okay it's not an essential but it means that in protein to survive you do not need carbohydrates just about the popular ketogenic diet which involves strictly limiting carbs to less than 50 grams a day 20 sorry Vicki if you're a man who can get by with it if you're an active man for those 20 grams a day or less but that's more than two apples worth of citing primary on high-fat foods is one of those restrictive diets they could have harmful long-term consequences why do they always go to the apples the hell's getting fat on the apples I'm just saying no is that you can't even have any well they just assume everybody likes apples I like apples but it's not my go-to fruit very low carb weight loss diets that fall into this category includes paleo Incans do penis and a whole thirty nutrition experts say that besides their potential for harm these popular diets are really hard to follow they're not hard to follow I'm a fat girl at heart I'm like a lot to you I like my french fries I like my chicken nugget select my cheeseburgers I like ice cream I like cake I like candy but I've managed to do cuter for 871 days that's just a little over two that's almost two and a half years ain't that damn hard to follow yes there's moments of struggle but it ain't that hard to follow okay you making some benefits of going going Tito are difficult to dispute borrowing a half high fat low carb diet can be a solid strategy for rapid weight loss and blood excuse me blood sugar control duh yukio diet can also be great for children with Chuck to control epilepsy seizures for decades people have seen stellar results managing these conditions on a keto diet with the help of guidance from a professional professiona there's been some of them in evidence that's going home low-carb might also lead people to become less tolerant of glucose and develop diabetes though more research is needed huh just that there said keto can help you manage glucose and now it's saying it could give you diabetes minutes let me help you with this diabetes type 2 diabetes is the body's overreaction basically it is an allergic reaction to sugar and carbohydrates to many of them if you take them out of your diet you don't have type 2 diabetes or not as bad it helps cure and manage for those it doesn't work but for the vast majority of us like me it can't cure your type-2 diabetes as it did mine okay well this one I don't understand why they did it this way but okay what we do know based on a careful conducted laboratory testing of overweight man what because by overweight women yeah it couldn't bounce it out to see how the effect is on man and women I don't know but anyway let's go is that going keto probably doesn't help burn more body fat than a regular regimen I got a cow overhead I'm not gonna call on it for the simple fact if you are overweight man and you actively trying to lose weight you probably can't lose just as much if you're working out and doing all that yeah if you're killing yourself in the gym and starving yourself alright but I'm you're saying it's probably not any difference in how much you can lose it's in the effect of which one is easier to lose it on keto is definitely the easiest one to lose it on no doubt but all I'm saying is if I was let's say I was overweight and I want to lose weight and I knew nothing about keto I could lose it just easily going to the gym working out everyday and managing what I eat without being on keto but see the term just as easily is negated by the fact right I don't gotta work where where they're all wrong and now that statement is famous just as easy no it's not you can get on keto and not have to work out and lose 30 pounds in a month maybe two top yeah if you're super morbidly obese you never lose that much weight I did I lost you say okie - I thought your stomach that next says other not an exercise so you're not gonna lose it that fast unless you're super morbidly obese then any pretty pretty much well many diets - did your calories you would lose it that fast yeah Tim you got to work out the Stars this way I don't got to do and eat kiddos the better way there's new kid okay instead it forces people to dramatically curb their sugar intake remember sugar is 100% carbohydrate in kick processed foods to curb well I mean no matter what diet you're on you should kick processed foods to the curb processed foods are not healthy what is healthy and stuff you grew out of your garden what you knew you put in it all start or if you go to the store and buy it's not going to be as good as you good but at least you know it's not got all those chemicals in it that you bought from that hand or that box those are both good habits of overall health and blood sugar levels and they can help reduce your likelihood of bell cancer yeah yeah yeah I mean processed foods and stuff like that will help you get it no no map you want to eat or not get rid of processed food you can go do keto get rid of processed foods yeah month before I started kita and I don't know if you were even aware but I worked out every day for a month where I started you know I also - naturally you I also got a Lucia but I was hiding from the kids because my son told me I looked the stick just standing there doing that but anyway he wouldn't mind about going to the next article but not want me going on to the next article read it last evening I think I miss those are both good habits for although health and blood sugar levels and they can help reduce you like a hurt in developing cancer I know what the hell I was saying now um what I was saying was that before I start kiddo I went to I tried a diet of my own accord what sounded right to me was basically just fruits and vegetables and lean cuts of meat so it was keto with fruit um I wasn't obviously get any ketosis because of the sugar and the fruit but um I kind of started there and win my way down but getting rid of everything like that all the grains and everything I did get rid of blood cancer incurable blood cancer you hear our grandson and they're screaming he just wants to teaching his momma days in their way but like taking aspirin eating a special high fat low carb bath probably shouldn't be in everyday habit for otherwise healthy people our bodies simply aren't designed to pure up on fats unless we're literally starving hold up like taking aspirin you shouldn't do it but doctors cardiologists will give you an aspirin every damn day okay yeah but you really shouldn't have to do that it's not necessarily good for you it is a chemical that you're putting into your body however hello carb diet it's not dangerous not even every day it's ridiculous okay Josh hey kiddo uh ambulance evangelist Peter preacher I guess that's it is not a diet that should be followed for more than a few months at a time josh is an idiot I don't get the hell Josh is but he's an idiot finally low carb diets make it easy to neglect key nutrients like magnesium calcium and potassium no I don't actually that's one thing we do preach like crazy Akito evangelist such as myself will tell you keep your magnesium potassium sodium in check otherwise you're gonna put her knowing yourself you will get mineral deficiencies you can get all of that on a keto diet right out taking anything you can plenty of vegetables with your kid or diet you just don't like vegetables so I don't give every day but before he started keto with me y'all know mostly I was a carnivore and I had a few greens here and there but I could take vegetables or leave them he cannot however however at the back of my calves start hurting real bad just like potassium or magnesium I ate a whole bunch of collard greens right as rain that can be painful on less restrictive diets with fresh high carb foods like beans bananas and oats yes you get a lot of potassium and some calcium from all that you actually get more potassium for a mistake than you do a banana but you do get a lot from it what really they always preach bananas because they do taste because people will eat them but the truth of the matter is you'll get more potassium from a pork chopper steak then you will from that banana so more studies suggest that people who eat whole nutrient-rich foods live the longest and have the lower Bristol pound okay now they're saying this as a regular diet no nutrients but you can get but you can get that in kiddo are you meat cheese eggs green leafy vegetables that's a whole new tree nutrition nutrients but what they mean is we had read into it no you know more research backs up certain such 30 August of the European Society of Cardiology and Congress researchers who presented at that conference study the self-reported eating patterns of nearly 25,000 people in the US and compared the results was 30s involving more than four two hundred and forty seven thousand five hundred people again they found that those who ate a moderate amount of carbohydrates were more likely to live longer than either low carb or high carb diets I was doing a moderate carb diet basically I wasn't eating a slew of carbohydrates before I started to but that moderate carb sad American diet they had beyond or that I was doing rather on my own because that's what we were told to eat was killing me the low carb diet the ketogenic diet is saving my life so I can just say bite it wasn't hurting me but I don't think it was doing me any favors and with my family history I'm pretty sure I was headed for disaster in about 20 years he's talking about with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's his family it runs in his family really bad in some heart disease to everyone every guy in my family has had Parker's money there has it now my grandpa had it my great-grandfather so I would say my chances of getting it it's pretty darn high pretty huh so we're doing everything we can to help keep his brain functioning properly and for those of you who don't know Alzheimer's is type 3 diabetes again you can't get that without sugar okay so well I mean you can there are other ways but sugars like catalysts can I study suggest that the long term low-carb diets are linked with an increased risk of death from any cause and deaths due to carnivore disease called a bad cardiovascular I was like the hell is carnivore disease holy can you break it up whatever that word is wait a minute cardiovascular the next one disease and cancer that's a person's name no dissing oh wow you don't know Nate it but it's another disease in cancer a branch official medical university of poland who helped write the study said any release the 30-30 published this week in the journal medicine that surveyed the eating habits of four hundred and seventy-one thousand Europeans over 22 years found that people whose diets had lower nutritional qualities example fewer fresh vegetables legumes and nuts or more likely to develop some of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer including colon stomach lungs liver and breast cancer huh I want you to know that a lot of times with these articles they'll put these big big search studies like four thousand five hundred thousand people but they're following these people basically they're sending them a questionnaire once in a while it's actually not proof of anything because it's to the best of your recollection what did you eat yesterday hell much time don't know except for I'll record it for y'all if you ask me I know it says the later in this armor the only way to do a real study is for us to become reps read laps and that ain't never going to happen so they never never ever ever gonna really do a real study on the effects diets have on people not long-term anyway I mean you would literally have to live someone for 30 years before they could do it it can be it can be tricky count calculating the precise kind of diet that leads to a long life part of the problem is that thankfully we don't live our lives in a highly controlled laboratory conditions no we do not until that terrified terrifying day arrives and we all become Wells 30 lab rats we have to rely on long-term observation data usually in the form of surveys to know more about which diets are the best long-term plans now we all know when you fill out a survey you lie you're not going to sit there and say you did this and that one she'll make you look bad no and you do not remember what you had last week come on whoo-hoo all right now can remember what you ate last Monday everything you ate for that whole day well except yeah I can't remember this on video but here you go well they don't have us all in a lab or research study how many of us do in quito preaching quito evangelizing quito I hate that sermon it's sacrilegious but anyway how many of us are right here on YouTube showing you what we eat every day weighing in every day showing you our blood test results from our doctors every day okay there's your proof my proof is in the fact that I started kidding with 25 medically diagnosed diseases and I have one left it's just thoroughness all hell stop squishing my fat rock yeah I like to read every day let's grant Raven misbehave okay it's dirty after study survey data from around the world has shown that people who stick to limited amounts of meat dairy and processed food again they preach in vegan and processed foods will build up on fiber rich plant-based foods including vegetables whole grains nuts and yes even carb heavy beans have some of the best health outcomes no no they were not processed she said of the diet of people in their 30 who lived the longest let's see here also is another problem with their study is they want to cut out all these things okay people who eat this this this and this but how about if they just cut out the processed stuff I mean did they ask anybody who just cut out the process stuff those people probably were just as healthy no give you an example of what they was eating and why these people are a bit healthier you're right I tell you right here the people who consume the whole grain rice not white varieties they ate plants like fruits and vegetables not more processed versions like fruit juice and smoothies those are the people that has longer lives but yes but that is no different than in the keto diet if you go to the store and you buy processed meat and I'm going to start and I'm oh I'm going straight to the butcher and getting real me I'm out live you probably that that processed foods you got a lot of chemicals in it that you don't know nothing about yeah I know that's true I mean I've been doing care for a long time and on occasion I try to use stuff like ham I've not found to him yet that doesn't kick me out of ketosis or make my water weight go up and it's almost all processed so I mean if you can find a really good good ham burden you probably found that but just about all that processed meat like that it's gonna mess with you is it's not good for you if you just simply take out processed foods if you if our biggest problem was only processed foods it wouldn't be a big deal we could come off of just that still eat our meat meat and vegetables and everything I don't think that it is our only problem but I do think processed food is the majority of the biggest problem all right you go back into the 30s in the 50s there was not a lot of OPI there was some there was some but it wasn't ain't like it is today and there was less a lot less processed food you went to the market you planted your own crops and now you got all these processed foods fast food restaurants that is the College of obesity in America it really really is if you did not have that consumption if you did not have that drive-through lane you could drive through when you didn't feel like cooking well you probably wouldn't hate that meal that day that's true most of us don't I mean some of us do make homemade cheeseburgers absolutely but it's rare yes you know after you've done working for something after you've done work twelve hours and you come home you don't feel like cooking like a big meal ladies I don't I'm sure you don't I've never seen you do I'm a terrible cook anyway so I'll leave it all to her my point is some of that article is very true you take out processed foods fast food that is the leading cause to obesity in America you cannot deny that no well I mean you think about processed foods there's also anything like little Debbie's and stuff anything at a fast-food restaurant because it all comes in a box it's all processed yeah by fiber let's talk about fiber this article I do agree with but I don't think you have to be extremist like they talk Bible isn't just good for keeping your gut moving scientists feeding diet rich in fiber to mice are discovering that carbs which can't be absorbed by the body can help protect against berta brains from aging brains from some of the damaging chemicals associated with Alzheimer's and reduce information there wait there's no meds no one we're not we're not not saying it's not true it's probably absolutely is true if you are car carbon heavy and it probably will help you with some of the things that Palmer times but you know it's may help you die everything with other times you know you know help you everything what kind of damn sugar do you like to worry about it at all so alright but vigor is still important you still do need to get some fiber because it does help with the bow and the movement of the gut and everything well I mean what some people fail to understand that the 20 grams of carbs on keto ideas are allotted for carbohydrate that is and that is a lot of fiber 20 grams of fiber that's a lot of fiber that's more than your body needs yeah now it's not all fiber but that's kind of the allotment it's like you should eat your 20 grams of carbs and your vegetables yes that's the point of that we don't but you should so you know there's a little extra something here dad if we didn't use the condiments and stuff like that condoms like you get away from me okay but a plant-based regimen with lots of fiber can be tricky to maintain in a low-carb diet because some of the highest fiber foods are also high in carbs such as soy beans crunchy peas as well I agree and disagree cause some of those carbs you can get by with even though the high some women can you just have to try and air and also some people are kicked out of ketosis by fiber that's expert in yeah well man Thomas de Lauer says a fiber kicks him out and I don't know if he means just like net carbs and I'm pretty sure I don't know I followed him a little bit I do like him I like his videos you know do that for me but anyway I would suspect the way he gets his fiber as he goes and kicks herself get all the fiber he needs to that one day that can last him for the whole week and then he goes back in maybe I've never heard I've heard him talk about going that way yeah I'm glad when he works out you got a car a book and then the next day you go fast hmm and so it balances out his calories right I usually pay attention and Thomas delao on things that affect my age weight and range or scientific you stuff but but he does this farce Barbara I do know I've heard him say that it does kick him but I don't know again if that's like net carb fiber like if he goes over his 20 grams with fiber if he watches this he can come in people are low carb he's super damp cool Tom's people on low-carb diets often turn to more butter and meats for substance which can't increase blood pressure I got low blood pressure I have really high blood pressure that's the only disease I can't get rid of I'm just saying if it increases blood pressure why is mine still look I mean it's not low low it's not anything to be worried about the doctors don't even mention it but everyone smile it is a little low my blood pressures have but it's been half of 12 years long before I met keto and baking him well not bacon you know so much beef and stuff my blood pressure was high no matter what Dad are they meat and dairy can also contribute to nobody which can help can't use tumors form the growth no it cannot meet kid Derek yeah but no I'm so sorry I got that Kido is a anti-inflammatory diet right so how is it going to make you buy to you what I meant was that some of the cheeses depending on what's added young to them could but a new scientific finding all supports while parents trainers and coaches have been saying for years eat less junk and continue to be skeptical the latest miracle diet be Aikido or any other passing fan he has been around since the mid eighteen hundreds and beyond as in it's your ancestral diet it's what we our DNA was founded upon using the people out on the plains a man a damn little bottom line try do keto for one month if you're not satisfied don't do it no more simple or just contact me I'll tell you how to do it right you probably did wrong but well I mean I know most most of y'all that's watching these videos are already doing keto or thinking about kids and if you are one that's sitting here watching this video and on the bubble about doing kiddo jump in give it a try well you got to lose a few pounds that's about it by the way I hope everybody do Tito for free so my contact informations below except for me she don't help me I feed him but I have to go to work it's not free then I cook your food what is it it okay so you know David come for a full foods list and a beginner's guide cuz um I guess I know that we act very very silly when we do these videos because it's to make it entertaining in food but I'm actually quite bright he's on the fence but if you enjoyed this video give it a like my god you did that's up now people have a good day we're out of here I said yeah", "TnwAUvnXyf0": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing some bezel brand cartridges i used to get these cartridges a lot whenever i first got into um vaping cartridges but a lot has changed in just about a year surprisingly and i feel like um cartridges were still pretty new maybe a year ago at least here and they seemed very like amateurish honestly for lack of better words there's a lot of stuff that looked like it just came out of label makers and a lot of that stuff and now everyone seems to have looks like a graphic designer on their team so um i'm gonna see i haven't seen bezel cartridges in like roughly a year and i think i know why but i'll let you in on why once i flip the camera around and show you what they look like [Music] so [Music] all right so i showed you what it looked like and um they don't look bad at all not at all uh the sticker let me do my usual thing i'm trying to take that off i don't know why that is but so a very good looking cartridge so these seem to have disappeared about um maybe a year ago or so pretty soon after i started vaping cartridges and that's along with the flavored buddies and my thinking behind that is i was looking into these and i believe they use non-cannabis derived terpenes they're still strain specific and it seems like they do a pretty good job of matching up the right terpenes to the strain um but we had a band here in oregon which banned all non-natural additives to vapes and really like all of them whenever the when people were having a lot of vape related lung history injuries or whatever it was called um so part of them trying to get rid of that was clamping down on all additives all flavored vapes anything like that and there is no flavored uh vapes or anything like that now um now that has expired and i don't think it's been resubmitted or anything like that because people have i guess gathered that it wasn't flavors at all it was just people selling unregulated vapes with who knows what in it and that's a classic thing about the whole black market of drugs to be gen in general is whenever they're illegal they're still going to be used still going to be sold but now you introduce a lot of areas for people just to not test or not have any rigorous standards set and you get a lot more health issues than originally so um that has been clear that that's not the link and now they brought these back and these are a really great kind of cheaper cartridge um these are 24 17. i s i'm pretty sure i used to get them for 25 so um pretty much the same price and it seems um and then especially i got them on sale for halloween yesterday halloween had some amazing sales i got um a white label that's what it is i got um one gram of white label live uh live resin sugar sauce super good looking uh it smells amazing and then i got one one gram cured resin cartridge and then one one gram live resin cartridge for eighteen dollars and twenty four dollars respectively and the live resin was um eighteen dollars a gram so and then these cartridges these those were 40 off these are 50 off at least they were yesterday which brought them down to i think it was 12 dollars and seven cents each really really really a great price um super hyped about that i'm actually just realizing now oh no okay i thought that it was leaking on the other one um but it's definitely not it's just the silicone looking weird so anyways that's the big spiel about like where they went and um they do seem to be priced kind of appropriately it's a distillate and non-cannabis derived terpenes um let me read some info about them so both of them were manufactured at the same time same date and everything like that they were manufactured on uh september the 7th and they made it to light scale labs and were tested on september 14th of this year um there's uh the tested all of that stuff so the cannabis terpenes in this one let me go through the other stuff first um the strain specifically for the one i'm doing today it's gonna be durban poison one of my favorite strains um i really really hated it and funny enough it has my favorite terpenes and i just flipped around on it um i believe it was a land race from durban south africa if not it was um cultivated there originally when it was crossed or whatever the thc content of this is 83.1 percent thc which it is on my other strain tangi as well and the cbd on this one is lower than quantitation so not very much um cbd on the other one is 1.2 so that's kind of nice they both have 10 terpenes and yeah so the terpenes in them um we'll see they're 10 looks pretty decent it doesn't look bad to me or anything and these are non-cannabis derived terpenes it'll say it says on here powered by true terpenes which probably can't focus in but it's just true terpenes logo and true terpenes is probably like the biggest terpene selling site online that i know of um i've wondered about them honestly because every all the carts that i do get usually use cannabis derived terpenes and most often live cannabis derived terpenes but those are extremely expensive online and um as they call them food grade or botanical terpenes not nearly as bad so if i wanted to turn some concentrate into them that would be the move but i never tried it because i wasn't sure that i would like it so let's find out so the terpenes in this in order is terpenoline at the highest then humulene and then beta cardiophiline that's pretty that is like exactly the turret profile for durban poison in my experience so let's find out i don't really taste much actually i'm familiar with terpenoline that's my favorite terpene and this does not taste like it there's like the faintest taste but you really can't even tell what it is it's terpenoline that fruity or not fruity i guess like a really sweet floral taste there's humulene which is hops like an ipa or something like that for only coffee beer it's a good comparison then beta cardio filling which is the peppery one i feel like maybe i can taste all of those but so my nude that they just come out as one flavor that you can just barely taste really yeah i really don't taste much from that um i feel like i do actually get maybe like some of the humulin and the beta cardio feeling but just done of the terpenoline and that's what durbin poison is all about it's really nice like almost potpourri i've heard it described but it's like a really sweet floral taste smell this is none of it um let me just try and judge it for the effects now all right i took a massive hit there and i got like very light terminology but even then it's so light it's like i don't know what the ratios of these terps are in but it's very low for ten percent earth especially this is not very terpy so i have to wonder about that but i mean it's lab tested and i don't i don't think that they would that'd be a weird thing to fudge if anything like thc is what they would do it'd be a weird thing to fudge like terpenoid or terps on a distillate um the effects very standard like pure distillate effects it's a very flat of like i feel very i feel somewhat spacey and um there's not very much of the stoned or like the body feelings or anything it's very flat very kind of empty i've heard it described as well it works for sure and especially like if you have a low tolerance thc it's way harder but my tolerance is quite high so i prefer the entourage effect all right um so my opinion is at the end of it there are good carts if you get them for a good price that price being very low um because they're not a bad card there's nothing like jumping out that's bad about it but it's just nothing that that's you know appealing really so um i got mine for like i said 12 bucks for a gram cart these are these are great to have just as like a backup if you need them or something like that because yeah you can't beat that price but i paid twice as much for a live resin and then one and a half times as much for a cured resin i don't regret that at all because i can guarantee these are going to taste so good especially in comparison to these so stay tuned to the uh stay tuned for those videos i'll have those out in the next couple days thanks for watching like and subscribe and have a great day", "QEb8Ryl868I": "hey guys what up its apex today I'm bringing you 17 special I've always looked at like concentrates and stuff like that I was like really am I getting the best value for my money because usually I spend money on distillates and stuff because they're easier to do and control and dos but I always like the rolling effect you know of a traditional dab where it's like oh you think you're done with one hit but no you got like a couple more and you know what I said if I can get the purists leg forms of DAB you know why not you know plus its 7:10 and I said you know what it's time to really look at these more and say are they worth it and the short answer is at $40 no unless you stretch it out versus traditional dabbing um I will say this though I was personally surprised um I got this for 36 bucks today or 34 because it was on sale for 710 and it's the Cresco lime sorbet definitely smells like it let me tell you I'm definitely a lot more hints along but I would say for me this is about 5 - worth versus the 20 they say but really all I can say is an indica and let's hit it now I've done dad's of war and stuff um I usually press my own from the flower I get to stretch out my flower a little more and this is liquid live resin oh man there might be more than just sleeping okay you know what I'm decently surprised on this if I was gonna be on a lot worse but but yeah this is usually about what I dab right about there from my press and usually when I press I I finally figured out that the amount I had to press which is 0.7 but it's point eight before I press it into a pot and press and that gets me about like were presses that are at least viable but anyway cheers guys gonna hit this out of um my titanium vaporizer right here move you guys back a little but Cheers you know it's really hard to there we go I mean it's Deb what more can you say [Music] I will say this liquid librarian is not really meant for those high temp tabs that I'm used to these are more for low and you keep going then the one-hit dabs I'm usually used to I like it you know do I say 0.5 is $40 in this in this form no at best 35 or lower but definitely not hot bad I mean definitely try it lime sorbet by Cresco look at why present point 5 like I said though I will give you an update on once I finished this and Oh almost forgot on I'm not finished with it yet literally got like a couple like like literally be smooch left in it but I can give you a salt we're eating for 50 bucks no anything under 50 bucks any honestly if you get the golden valley punch get it on sale it's nice and all but not worth 50 bucks and you know how and it's more in you know that's just how I feel but if you can get this for under 50 bucks the golden valley punch definitely give it a try I liked it it's not a ten out of ten but on more of like 9.5 so definitely try it out if you can I like it you should too anyway this in Apex peace", "G5Id6NDjYOc": "[Music] what's up guys it's p2 peeps and welcome to uh kind of a revamped version of our product reviews this time we'll be calling it is it good so today on is it good we've got some concentrate from bright labs we've got the obama cush caviar crumble it is an indica um let's see let's hope you guys just saw the percentages but we got a total cannabinoid percentage of 79.4 thc percentage sitting at 67.9 and we've got 2 terpenes in there so that's very nice stuff tested on 817 packaged also 817. so so without further ado check out what's in here all right there's a little bottom there it says little strain name this is a little bit different from any of the other containers i've had for uh crumbles and stuff like that so you'll see it's got this little uh rib kind of casing but yeah here we go here's the obamacush caviar crumble let me try to angle the camera down a bit for you don't want to drop it but there it is boys i'll be sure to try to get uh you know better close-ups for y'all but that's what we're working with so yeah well today we'll be dabbing off of the hyperion in this one and yeah so while i pack this up get the hit ready and while you guys get your hit ready uh i'm gonna go into why i'm gonna be calling these product reviews is it good instead because personally i feel like my reviews haven't really been like the greatest reviews you know with the review you're generally expecting a rating of some sort and all that stuff and while i did want to come up with a tier system and rating system i just don't think that that's fair um enough not even just fair it's just really hard to be able to come with a come up with a very consistent uh rating and a tier scale and all that stuff you know um a lot of people will just make it very definitively you know what i mean uh one product or two products that they try from a brand automatically uh you know either makes or breaks their reputation in some people's book and for me i believe that um you got to try to have their specialty stuff or you got to try out a few of their things before you really put a verdict out because sometimes you could just be getting a product you just might not like from anybody you know so that's why i want to start doing it is it good kind of seriously you guys can get a definitive answer whether it's good or not you know and i normally do give that answer and i recommend whether i recommend someone to go try it or someone to um you know go see what's up but yeah i think with this i'll at least achieve a goal of the review which is letting you guys know whether it's good or not so i've got this right here just cooking up just gonna let it preheat and then uh heat up a little bit more so yeah i hope you guys have been enjoying the content as of late i know it's a bit different from before but like i said i'm still working on a bunch of things but this is my first bright labs concentrate i have had a bright labs cart before i didn't like it as much but this concentrates not bad if you guys know the difference between regular crumble and caviar crumble please let me know because i have no clue what the difference is to me it seems like they're just about the same they're both crumbles but i will say that this leaves off a lot stronger of a kind of a roasty kind of kush smell not roasty but more of like a doughy there there's like a doughy cannabis kind of smell off of it so we're gonna go ahead and take a hit and i'm gonna let you guys know what i'm tasting and you know how i'm feeling about it so hope you guys are ready cheers you know it's got a very similar flavor to um a lot of the flavor crumbles that i've had actually especially the ones that are uh similar to color as or similar in color to this obamacush caviar crumble but i do like uh like for most other brands that do it i do appreciate that they have the cannabinoid percentage in there and the terpene percentage i wish that they had the terp profile but that's okay buddies is probably i think the only brand that really does that consistently i mean there probably are other brands i just haven't tried them yet so let's go ahead and take a second hit out of this and let you guys know what else i'm tasting from this you know aside from just us what i just tasted initially which is just kind of like a doughy doughiness and then you know too much shell so we'll go ahead and get another hit here cheers everybody i'm getting a really nice diesel kind of um clean also kind of taste there too not too much anything else um not not much pineness or anything like that this is my first uh time having the obamacush strain i think it's kind of a funny name never really caught on to myself with that kind of stuff or the obama runs i just i just think that they're weird names uh it's not to say that i don't like obama or anything obama's dope but let's not get too political guys come on no and i don't want to see any of that in the comments we are just here to get it all right so that should be it for uh our little sample dabs of the obama cush there it's really nice stuff honestly um for about got this about 45 i believe you're 48. um i think that this is just a tad bit overpriced uh its potency isn't actually up there as i would have expected this is about as potent as some of the flavor crumbles i've had but i can tell that this is definitely a little more time into it you know like most of the flavor crumbles they smell a little bit like how the strain tastes a little a little the same with this but the cool thing about um this huge brick of crumble is that it kind of leaves that edible smell off of it so if you guys have ever had an edible that was really jam-packed and loaded with thc you guys would probably be able to smell it you know that tiny little baked doughy kind of cannabis kind of smell in there um you know emanating off of that super potent edible well that's the kind of smell i get off this which is pretty cool um we had i'd say that it's potency is a very mild um and for foreign indica there uh i definitely like i said i had had some flavor crumbles that were a little bit better than this one that's not to say that this isn't quality you know um i do think that it has a fuller kind of uh taste compared to flavor crumbles you know this one tastes a little bit more uh like like flour you know obviously they both don't taste like flour at all but this is this inches a little bit closer there so you know we gotta appreciate that so yeah without further ado i'm gonna go ahead and get one more rip in here for you guys um but yeah that's that's all i got to say mostly about uh this one i can't really you know since it's very mellow and very light for an indica for me at least uh it's not really sedating me or putting me out like some other strains will but who knows maybe this is a sleeper maybe this might take a few minutes for uh you know 20 minutes or something like that maybe longer maybe shorter to kick in and you know really start beating my ass but we'll see all right got the last dab packed up in there oh man i forgot to show you guys what the little globs we've been taking here so i will show you guys real quick how much i just did or how much i just put in there put in about this much i know that doesn't really help but yeah maybe in the future when i get my scale back i will start weighing out dabs so you guys can maybe even join me for a similar sized dab but i mean as soon as i bust out a scale and start doing that i mean that's that's also one very extra to weigh on dabs and two then uh you know i feel like some [ __ ] who's just gonna come along and either make a comment about the scale itself or the size of the dabs me personally i don't really care how fat of a dab you take i just care that you dab or you hit a bowl while uh you're watching me because uh you know do these are fun and i do know that a lot of you guys sesh to these so i just want to make sure you guys are enjoying your session as much as i all right so i'm just gonna let this one cook up for a little bit of time and then we're gonna go ahead and dig in get a little dabby yeah if you guys have any have had any bright labs concentrates products please let me know i'm looking to see and look i'm looking to look into it more you know see what kind of more products are more of their specialty i guess or if they have any better caviar crumbles not to say that i didn't like this but uh you know so after i take this step then we're gonna go over what the notes of the flavors and stuff like i talked about earlier and then we'll answer the question is it good so i think mine is almost about right here i'm just going to give it just a little bit more time to cook up i did pack in a good amount there dropped it a little extra too all right oh so now that i've given some time it is sitting a little bit more so i'll let you guys know how i'm feeling after this cheers oh yeah it's got more of that cleaned easily piney taste in there i didn't say piney before but now i'm getting a little bit of that yeah those doughy notes again i'm gonna try to clear the rest of this and then we're good to go all right so yeah like i said doughy a little piney mostly clean gassy kind of diesely kind of taste um you know it smelled a lot like uh really strong edible when you know just the concentrate itself and undabbed yeah and uh you know it's decently filled you know i said it wasn't as problem before as some other ones but now i'd say it's just about that level of flavor so that's not too bad at all um for 48 to 50 dollars though uh this is okay you know but in a question of whether it's good or not you know whether it's good and potent it is this is decently good you know i think it's pretty good i said decently and pretty good i don't know which one is which i don't know i don't know which one i'm feeling maybe something in between that but um yeah this isn't anything terrible by any means or standards or whatever you know i just think that it could be a little bit cheaper but then again i am used to paying pretty cheaply for my crumbles uh this is maybe one of the most expensive crumples i've gotten but i mean for you know 50 48 i think i think 45 to 50 bucks you know it's not too too bad yeah guys i hope you guys enjoyed this one if you did please leave a like comment and subscribe um that stuff all helps the channel a lot so yeah i hope you guys have a great one and enjoy this one so peace out peace [Music] you", "yVB5oxN1D-g": "down the overflow been like that Girl Scout

softer today much better not so good with the organic ketchup so I probably make ketchup but I'm gonna try to eat these beef tips I guess with that beef tips I had six double dates and technically three so technically three you know six day yes I was watching GSN what cute everyone talking about collagen and I decided hey let's put some collagen am i soda and see what happens I don't think it's gonna work so well I don't know what I made here but I only put like half a serving into so yeah it this is as far as the foam is going down is like 10 minutes I've been kind of waiting and it yeah it's looking more like a root beer float than anything and it's just a little bit of collagen powder so I don't think it's gonna work that one soda you know what it says this is the ordinary collagen peptides it actually it's flavorless but buddy it thicken this drink up it actually tastes pretty good so I'm gonna see if I can't get through this and we'll see what happens alright so this is the one I'm using if you guys are interested in this it is you get 30% off your first order in the description below it's always there so if you're ever interested it's it's just always there I have some of their protein powders and all of those also have collagen in them are you guys to say I'm having three more deviled eggs just what like one and a half eggs there anyway and six slices of bacon cut in half and fried this is actually fast becoming one of my favorite meals but I really can't wait for this whatever is going on with me to pass because I feel like I'm eating just way too much there yeah so I legitimately cannot wait for this PMS season to be able the shark week because I am ravenous I want to everything I thought this was over it is not over a true the gerotor Ghirardelli 82% dark chocolate and about one serving of the sea salt caramel ice cream all right you guys calories a macro as per my fitness pal for yesterday twenty two hundred and forty eight calories 31 grams of total carbohydrates 165 grams of fat and 145 grams of protein I'm okay with the protein perfectly fine with that everything went alright way and why so I'll show you that in just a minute but I really need to I can't wait for the lady issues to go away so I got a long day playing yo hello I only got one go but I don't know where the hell of a fossil of a breath we are finally down to our last roll I've done pretty good over this course of everything and if I saw you know a pack I'd buy a pack the thing is I haven't seen a pack in a while and now we're almost gone so I'm gonna check two or three places if I can't find then I reckon we're gonna do the baby wipe thing not that I'm completely opposed to that but it's not you know perfectly ideal for daily use and don't worry we won't flush because we ain't trying to tear up our toilets by the way word to the wise even if they say flushable you shouldn't be flushing them okay so especially be a septic tank I don't we don't push anything interceptive t plus I'm telling you don't like to flush myself it rained you don't flush so TP is not a good idea sorry not the conversation I'm sure you guys were wanting to hear oh my goodness I designed two new t-shirts last night it just depends on what kind of person you are if you're gonna like one or the other once it's keto Baconator and it has a tiny little peak alligator on it the other says God guns and ketones so I'm gonna show them to you real fast if you want him the T Springs link is below so you can go get you one so I hope you guys like them there's a bunch of other shirts I designed over there that you can go check out to also was approved to be an affiliate with magic spoon which is Akita friendly cereal like a child's kind of cereal so either for you or for your you know your child or whatever but they're expensive they're not exactly cheap however there's a little discount code Kito diamond all one word and if you type that in you get a little discount and you here to check out and I personally personally really love the frosted ones they're like powdered vanilla donuts I love them and the cinnamon is pretty good too none of them were bad none of them were bad at all but the frosted and the cinnamon they took the cake and they were they were the most yummy if you're interested again the link will be below with all that stuff and everything below let's see I'm gonna stop by the post office first if there's anything here of course I'll be showing it to you but I don't know that I'm expecting anything today plus it's Saturday I'm not real sure they even open inside but you know so I was watching a video last night by Miss Jess ever keto rewind I think most of y'all know who she is and she was talking about collagen and how great her skin looked and she's not lying she's lost 120 pounds and her skin looks fabulous now there's some big differences between her and me I'm a little older from the way she talks I've been much bigger much longer than she was I put on most of my weight in my late teens and I gained even more you know in my mid mid thirties so I was bigger Longer so my skin's gonna be a little bit different plus I'm very short so losing even a similar amount of weight still gonna look different on my body there's going to be more skin because my short skin was more stretched out than hers even though our start weight was very similar and she's lost 120 I've lost one almost 150 now so there's some differences but her skin does look great and she tells collagen all the time she talks about how she uses collagen all the time and I've got collagen all that or gain stuff that they sent me that I even bought some of it or in some of y'all sent me some the or gain stuff which with the link below you get 30% off your first order so if you're gonna try it why not save 30% but I just had to pull it out last night now even like said their protein powders there their chocolate tastes just like a chocolate frosty from Wendy's especially if you mix it instead of using water with unsweetened vanilla almond milk that stuff's amazing I put it in my soda yes I'll have that grit I'm telling you if you're gonna do it your soda you just don't want much soda in there cuz you're gonna film in both but it's gonna be foamy every which way and it's gonna thicken it up you know and honestly I had no problem using it last night I even used it this morning it's in my cup now because it thickened up my soda to the point that it was kind of like root beer float like the intesa it tastes like Dr Pepper fruit and that Dr Pepper float but that cherry doctor grabs like whatever anyway so I'm sure this person who just pulled in thinks I'm lunatic but it's okay they don't know where I'm not on a video call let's take a look at me looking at myself but it tastes good it worked out fun and the collagen powder by itself is unsweetened so it doesn't have any flavor just picking things up a little bit and I was scared was gonna be like powdery or grainy none of that so um I'm impressed with the organs keto products i just am i do like their products a lot to say if you're in the market for something like that why not give it a shot especially since that chocolate taste is so damn good yesterday i was ravenous and i have been for the last since i started my period to be honest with you and I'm so sorry guys I know if you're a man you don't want to hear about all that but unfortunately everything that happens with our body kind of affects our weigh-ins kind of affects our moods emotional eating different stuff like that and yesterday early in the day I was fine when I did my video I was perfectly fine but once I started eating I didn't want to stop I am in ketosis I have checked but I was just ravenous somebody said that they didn't think I was getting enough calories before and then other people are like well yeah but when you get closer to the calories you've got recommended on your MyFitnessPal then your weight-loss does better and they're not lying because but I mean that's pretty standard procedure there so all that that I ate yesterday I don't really recommend I want you I want you to know I show you what I eat to be open transparent and honest not so that you can follow in my footsteps exactly in fact I on a normal basis I would say leave the dark chocolate alone leave those keto ice creams alone however if they do not spike your insulin if you can lose weight on them if they are perfectly heated friendly for your body and keep you in a state of ketosis and you're enjoying it I got no argument with it I mean if you can have it you can have it look whatever y'all it's a beautiful shirt want to go wonderful people sent it to me and I'm still loving it I would rock it a lot more except first long-sleeve and it's coming into the summertime but North Carolina's had a cold snap so it's pretty out there you can get a tan you don't be getting goose bumps at the wind blows so it's kind of one of those weird days I think it's time to get to the weigh-in what do you think yes the fat pointt all right so going by my tracker this is the phone destiny gave me it is an iPhone 6s plus the thing is y'all don't seem to like the sound quality so again you're gonna have to tell me today if the sound is better in on this video so according to my tracker from my scale which is a Wi-Fi scale it sends everything to my phone you can see my kind of ups and downs you can see where I had the yeah oopsies and all that so yesterday I was 166 point for today 165 point 2 that's another 1.2 pounds lost still holding on to 2.2 pounds of water at least because my lowest was 163 something in this car is rattling I have no idea what it is I'm so sorry oh but you try to ignore the rattling oh that was sexy uh-huh I love this phone but if the sound quality is no good it's I don't know what to do because it's got a lot of apps on it and one has the one the one reasons not wanted this one the camera is supposed to be better the camera quality is supposed to be better so I would think that would include sound but clearly when I watched the videos back the videos I had did on this phone here a couple weeks back are much louder than this one which is crazy since iPhone you know and this one is a j7 refined Samsung although the camera I got to say the front and back camera are both 12 mil megapixels they're both really good quick quality cameras and this one that's I think she said 16 I'm not sure but it's gonna annoy me because this has a lot of space on it tons and tons of space this one I'm constantly running out of space even when I'm clearing everything out so I don't know what do you think she'll call D enough better good enough huh is the sound quality clearer on this one then they have been in the last few days have you been having a hard time hearing me and today you're not that's that's kind of what I want to know I tried those self tanner wipes that destiny brought him it's like 10 dollars and I full thing but there's been like six wipes on it but it's supposed to work overtime and to me I do look a little tanner not a lot but of course it was the first wipe so I'm gonna tell you what I think about that but I want a real tan I want to get out here in the Sun without freezing to death because it looks like it's beautiful but mm-hmm you know also I'm so close to hitting 5k guys all of us there's almost 5000 of you guys the thing is um over the last month I dropped a lot and now a lot of people did this was commonplace on YouTube many people drop subscribers why because everybody was less interested in stuff that we're talking about like for me a weight-loss vlogger talking to you about how I was waiting my body you know that most people were more interested in covet and what was going on so they were mostly watching those videos they were subscribed and they weren't worried about losing weight this that and the other and of course I'm sure some of them just didn't like me so I dropped by about a hundred people usually in a month I gained between 100 and 300 people but this last month has been ready this and then finally I shot up from 4900 - right under 5k right under went all the way up to four thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven people then dropped down to four thousand nine hundred ninety people and it's kinda like fluctuating it's teasing me it's deep you're teasing me I'm almost at 5k so if you haven't subscribed there's a red button right there that says subscribe I need y'all to hit that and hit that like button that make me feel good make me happy and I'll be finally able to say yeah a 5k so close enough right I mean I'm glad you guys are all here with me y'all make everything just brighter I'm gonna stop right here I'm running this post office if I got something I will show it to you if not I'll be right back to wrap up so I got two things one thing a month wait till Monday to pick up because it was too big to go in my box so they're not open on Saturday and Sundays inside there and I got a box from Michelle I'm gonna pause this open it and then I'll show you what's inside this is kind of neat hold on let me show you how this one cuz y'all know I love sugar skulls she sent 20 masks oh wow that's got embroidering on like diamond e things on it that's beautiful in its place got out of the blue I don't think we have any Bloods and Cripps an honor but she sent 20 masks you know I'm going to show you how some of these are really really adorable is it Thor though we're gonna think or action figures action figures like the green guy The Incredible Hulk good lord how many kids I've gotten how many times I've seen credit actually like incredible it myself they

position charm that likes Amandine have tattooed right here how cool would that mask me with the anti possession charm like right there cuz like no demons are getting in she she wrote me a letter it's kind of lengthy I have a hard time reading so I'm gonna pause I'm gonna read Elmo some other event so Michelle saw where another lady is - just a couple masks that were a little bit too small we did use those a little bit but it was kind of a struggle with them because we tied these things to them and the ties just never went stay quite right so I do appreciate these I appreciate you both I want you to know that I really do and anything y'all send I appreciate I just I want you to always know that Michelle is from Ohio she is enjoying having a good time making these masks and I think she's done a fabulous job both of you ladies did I hope they go this way I think they would get the other way unless that's the news piece you know I might have had you don't upside-down this might be hot

this right if you try to make this right what's a guy's simplistic hair fact with another well I'm just if you want you should always put someone biting your thing I dunno what's up guys simplistic so guys simplistic here back with another video if you can see or you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be a diamonds bear labs review but we got RJ eats you know I'm saying shout out to the homie and also tattoos by kaze if you guys haven't checked out the merch I'll also post got in the bond description below that is my homie right there and he does tattoos so if you're interested in the Modesto 209 area show you boys and love you know I'm saying I show you the back and I mean yeah yeah so yeah which is surprising that cos he actually went up to me and was like someone actually messaged him through Instagram through my videos and was like can I get one of these so that's pretty cool another thing I like to mention I'm not gonna probably mention it and then in like the next coming videos probably do a few more times but my merch is going to have a coupon code because it is my birthday month and if you enter March for all caps you get seven dollars off your merchandise so should be a good little discount for you guys but like I said I'm gonna mention it in probably like a few more videos because kind of getting annoying and now I've already did it like twice and I feel like it's a little bit repetitive but you know I'm saying if you want some gear get some gear if you don't okay no I'm sayin so we got some bear labs and just as like the other video I'm gonna have him open it and then imma film it with my camera that way I don't have to take off this you know right here is sherbert so right off the bat you could notice that that ninety seven percent total cannabinoids but just for those of you who think that that's THC it's not tht is actually on the top left right there no off 20 on the bone right there so it's actually 85 percent THC at low temperatures so right off the bat like from looks when she showed me it no diamonds don't mean like that means she's a little small so open [Music] this smell is actually like so I'm okay so with diamonds usually there is like barely any taste I've noticed because it's like I guess it's like THC a diamond I don't know what it's not really good though there lies always smells good and they see you know yes - Wow we're gonna reserve our judgment till we actually tried the damn thing you know anything but rather bat I'm gonna be using the utility and you know I'm saying we got the bubbler from brain fog er brain we do it gentlemen this start it already let's start reporting oh yeah is it it's gonna be for this actually no it's because there's no stabilization on there you definitely notice it instead of like on the camera [Music] yes so if you haven't already try to look for some extra videos it's kinda like extra videos from my channel you know but it's a his perspective you know like if you if I don't upload on that day maybe check out some more videos baby no no my boy I'll post every dance and I don't know he's five days woman if I did yeah I stream on Tuesday and then Friday at a deal Cheers we're gonna pecs on my wife's hands it we got judge this wax first goes in give it a shot up you gotta start cleaner that's probably my taste Wow yeah not bad bro just like a better version of the candidate no it tastes like it tastes like what choppa Canada tastes like when it's good well we try it yeah was anything mean was that less trouble Kenan could use no I just said it server honey no I said it please like like it should have been it [ __ ] truck in bucket truck I subscribe why we're picking that up again a Linda I receive it some rubble looking right away and about address agent the truck panic look into other direction we didn't see that [Music] it's not bad honestly for diamonds I thought it'd be less curvier we're like no taste at least but I wanted to do this video for you guys bear labs dine in sherbert diamonds number one we call it it's actually pretty smooth to so but in car it was good better than trouble Kenny Kenny's that keep picking up in bear laps maybe you know continue I always show love regarding this one in blue $27 over there 29 row garden that's do so yeah no I checked this is 29 oh that's why been buying raw garden guys I'm trying to try some new stuff and uh with new stuff I could do videos you know nice room no I'm pretty sure you guys are sick of raw garden wax videos cartridge videos I'm not sure if you guys are sick of it just because they're cartridges but we're gonna take one more parts we're gonna get into cartoon and it's so convenient how you can just have it anymore any time adjusting it and good good size not bad but for $29 I probably wouldn't just spent $2 less in garden for maybe four dollars less and Bob got easing in because like I said I only bought this because this is a new thing I've been buying buddies lately wall garden all other stuff and to switch it back to their labs you know every now and then and it's not that it's not not the best you know the best of their labs I think was for me in greeters that all the one that I did a video on I'm not sure what it was yeah no mine was like banana or something banana really no it might have been something cookies I don't know what it was but I'll check it out but yeah there you go shine sherbert timings check out our J eats merch if you want to check that out and I gotta talk about this with precious everybody wants me to [Music] pick a song cut every 5th grade [Music]", "H6Oumhl99Xk": "[Music] hello guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane back again for another concentrate review today I'm checking out this home world's finest raw and uncut extracts blueberry bread now that's blueberry and then breads spelled the Jordan way I guess be re d instead of lambs bread I'm not sure the genetics on this one you know I would guess it was blueberry and lambsbread pretty much you know good good indica good sativa mixed together looking at the tag on the side of the box here this one comes in at 54.3% THC less than 2% CBD crack this thing open here and check out the nose okay so it's definitely a little bit a little bit of a blueberry thing going on there it's not really the sweet kind of fresh out of the oven blueberry muffin that I've come to you no love from blueberry this is a strain I used to see a lot when I was growing up that you don't see a lot anymore at least the blueberry side of it actually the first time I ever grew weed the first time me and Dan grew we I think we were probably 17 through a couple group couple plants down there in his mom's basement which ended up being you know turned into the dungeon later on I think we added a bunch of purple dragon to OG plants in one blueberry I remember the blueberry we put in a five gallon pot the other ones were in like two or three s this one was in a you know tall 5 gallon so it was you know closer to the light and everything we didn't know anything about how to you know crop our plants you know anything about [ __ ] toppings super cropping or basically we didn't know anything about training plants at all so this thing was basically just a beanpole and a big 5 gallon bucket with one big-ass cola at the top but I remember the smell on it was crazy we would go in there and just geek out on it all the times it just smelled like straight blueberry muffins so obviously whenever I'm smoking blueberry that's kind of what I'm hoping that I get when it comes to the smell again I don't know the exact genetics this strain the blueberry we used to get back in the days was definitely a you know pretty heavy indica you know lambsbread always affected me more of like a you know typical sativa so if that is the genetics of this one I've in fact I would expect it to be a little bit of a 50/50 hybrid I need to get higher what am i doing I'm talking abou long without taking a - so on that note we're gonna fire this thing up decided to pull out the old right crafted for this one this is definitely one of my go-to pieces whenever I wanted to taste something for the first time or just you know anytime I want to hit something that really shreds but also is gonna give you that really really nice flavor definitely a little turf saver with this one you can basically rip it as hard as you want doesn't get any splash and this is with like maximum amount of water in there like probably more water than I would tell somebody put in there I mean I got it almost a third of the way up the drain but I like it like that gives it a little bit more chug that won't get good flavor out of this thing as far as the nose goes honestly I'm probably gonna give this one like a six out of ten wasn't getting quite what I was hoping for on the nose I'm hoping it makes up for it with the flavor sometimes they do that do my research here [Music] flavors pretty good on them and actually like that a little bit more than I like to smell on this one it wasn't that you know classic traditional blueberry flavor that I was looking for maybe hoping for but it did it did have a nice pungent sweet kind of taste to it I wouldn't necessarily like I said that wouldn't call it a blueberry taste but it was a pleasant taste I'm gonna go ahead and bring the peak over here heat this thing up real quick I'm gonna try another dab off of here and see if we get a little bit different flavor a lot of times it tastes the same you know as long as you take a low temp dab off both it's generally gonna taste pretty similar but sometimes I get a little bit different flavor profile off the off the feet than I do off a rig go ahead and press it as things heating up there you go [Music] usually got the coughing a little bit on the beak over here flavor basically the same out of that just a nice sweet flavor settles in like right when you exhale you kind of feel it settle in on the palate we can still kind of taste it a couple seconds after I take the rib which is always good for me personally when I'm smoking you know the super high-end stuff or maybe not high-end but the high-dollar stuff what I'm looking for is like the flavor obviously you want it to pack a punch but really what if I'm gonna spend the extra money and try something I want it to either be something I haven't tried in a long time so I want to convert a nostalgic reasons or just something you know exciting and new that I haven't tried yet so really at that point I'm paying for the flavor you know there's a lot of things I could smoke to get my buzz where I want it to be as far as spending some real coin on some weed though you know I'm really really going for something exotic it's gonna give me that flavor profile that I haven't tried yet this wasn't exactly that nevertheless I take pretty good stuff the hundred dollar price point for some regular life resident to me is just too high obviously things are crazy with where the prices are in Cali right now but just like all the other states that have legalized you're gonna see prices come down in the coming months and years so you know the market will balance itself out but for right now if you had to ask me what I buy it again definitely not for a hundred bucks a gram nevertheless I do have pretty nice bug feeling from it definitely is some good stuff yeah so if I could rate this one I think I'd probably go like a seven out of ten you know like I said the looks and the smell probably weren't exactly you know what I was looking for on something like this but the taste was pretty good and the buzz is definitely good I'm feeling pretty good buzz off off of those couple of dabs still definitely trying to get stuff like this to review from shops obviously it's more relatable to you guys it's cool when we get stuff to smoke on a review that you guys also have access - so you know it is what it is right now you know it's it's it's pretty rough out there on the streets for somebody who's trying to buy you know stuff that met the standards that they've gotten used to over the last couple years in in legal shops now for the same you know same price points it's it's it's tough so you know obviously everybody out there is adjusting to that we're adjusting to that if I had to do it again I probably wouldn't pay the hundred dollar price point for this stuff you know it's good but you know for a hundred bucks I can think of quite a few other products I would rather spend my money on when I'm going into a legal weed shop obviously you know you'll see the market level out of the next couple years just like all the other states that have you know gone legal so obviously in a couple years you're not gonna be paying $100 for a gram of white resin so you know keep that in mind I know it's a little depressing for some of the people out there right now they've been going into some of their favorite shops for all these years and having access to all this fire at reasonable prices and you know now things are a little bit different so definitely appreciate you guys watching if you guys are dab along with me let me know what you guys are smoking on down there in the comments for another episode of the CCC I'm Shane [Music] you", "clT0ZfwR5j4": "means ask for the 99% diamonds we got you a half gram and 99% diamonds they're hard as a rock not that wet tar penis they don't stick to you so we're gonna turn it into a cart so yeah let's get this started so you pretty much start out it's a clean empty like Pyrex container Wow what's up hey I'm doing a video what's up you coming over yeah on YouTube like I'm in the middle of the please please what's up you can you feel me coming over or do you don't all right you need you an extra empty Pyrex little glass container take that you're done baby there's a canary yellows I like the clear ones better I don't know while they're gonna have the tarp but these ain't bad these are like infused in the turf they're like not in saw so they still give you that little bit of flavor but they pack a super super duper punch knock down knock down blink all right that's our diamonds in there now let's add some of this wax liquidizer here pineapple express make sure you shake it up real nice this is still good that's been old it's a newer one pretty new might go with the Strawberry Cough what do you think public sponsor strawberry cause this one's been a banana orgy Strawberry Cough we're gonna do straight and it's hurt just strawberry cop it says to add ingredients add two milliliters of wax liquidizer to a microwavable safe cup saw glass along with one gram of your herbal concentrate microwaving mixture for 10 seconds well I'm not microwaving it and I'm only doing one milliliter of wax cuz the more you add the more runny it is and it just I don't know it ain't the same you can stretch it stretch it to be like you know you can get ten carts out of it or you can get like two decent ones so I'm gonna go with the 100 cuz I only got point 5 in here too so yeah we're gonna do one gram or 1 milliliter of this here again make sure you shake real well it's nice and clear stuff they say one of them tubes full equals one milliliter so there's your 1 million right there oh [ __ ] with the Diamonds oh man I'm really ATG I hope this comes out good all right that was 1 milliliter of wax liquidizer Strawberry Cough see it sorry it looks like it's starting we're gonna take us inside put it on the heat I don't do the microwave I throw it here and the stove I don't all melt down to the bottom somebody told me that who knows break down a little bit around whack shatter stuff like a crumble don't take this long usually tardive been mounted up this is just a harder denser that moonwalking again leave it on there for five more minutes all right this was looking like really clear really nice but really runny but it's hot they should thicken up I hope I'm gonna throw it in a needle a syringe and see what happens see outside all right it's only put it out those are them diamonds before it's too thick and I hope it does but I didn't flip that one soon so there is there this on there take that baby don't buy so far it's hard it's definitely still hard so you gotta give us some time to cool down you know first and the less bubbles you keep in your syringe the cleaner it comes out the bubbles make it all fuzzy they won't come on after the cartridge sits for a little bit but it happens we got a G got a G buying around [ __ ] look unclear [Music] super clear throw it in the cart you know Wow is that clear as clear could be damn that is dope queer [ __ ] this clears out it looks super good super clear everything mixed right the molecules are all in all fuzzy-wuzzy we try to get these last couple drops oh you're supposed to let these sit for 24 hours and I really am on patient it does move out a little bit more than I want to kind of pissed me off like I said it's still hot we'll see what happens but let's throw on a cart homemade cartridge from like wax liquidiser Suns right miles I'm sorry it's running I don't know why they tell you to put two point two milligrams whatever but let's try and smooth to throw like a lot of that other cut bullcrap pretty good I fell it it's good tastes good as long as this [ __ ] don't burn up in like seven hits the last video I made months ago is my phone it must have been crappy wax i noticed if you use better ID potency wax that you get a better outcome when we need more diamonds not I don't know 99 percent but they were anywhere from 96 to 99 and this stuff here so get in the stuff that's killing everybody out there is a thickener agency that's not everybody's putting in their cartridges not everybody but like the street lower than the street people China maybe who knows their felonies courts with that thickener just to make them look like they're thick and so you think they're good well that's not the case no more they got this new liquid it looks like distal and literally cleared this one you can flip it over it runs real slow you add that in the card and that's what has that vitamin e in it ain't bad for your body or for your skin but when you're in hell in that I mean look at the crisis that's going on right now like it's the same like ruining everything good that was going good for the medical marijuana program is getting run out with this cart stop these it's just sucks you know but how is that my snow that [ __ ] that [ __ ] works that works how's the bottom up still nice and yellow around every time you take a hit though oh yeah but it's not good or guys just killing [Music] that's pretty good I can't believe it Chase is really good my axe liquidizer man you did it the first video I made I messed up use the wrong wax you got to use a a decent type of wax to get you the best pass this is this looks as good as I might did it with this Dylan just Allah", "AhhH5JHfBro": "warning the following shows what weed and weed materials viewer discretion is advised tonight all the weed

spreadsheets i love them too and so today i am going to take you along with a full week of eating i show you everything i ate and i calculated exactly how much it cost so there's a spreadsheet which i'm calling my master food cost spreadsheet down below some items are not on the spreadsheet and that's because i don't know how much they cost for example i have a package of dates and i don't know what i paid for those at one point in this video i eat some pesto out of my freezer i made it over the summer with produce that i got from the farmer's market i have no way of accurately figuring out how much that cost in those kinds of cases i have guesstimated and probably guesstimated on the high end for food costs so every meal you'll see up on the screen the price how much it cost me to make and you will see at the end of the day a daily total at the end of the week i will come back and talk a little bit about my thoughts on the challenge how much i spent in total as well as where i could cut my costs if i really wanted to all right let me show you day one [Music] all right here is my breakfast today i just finished my run here i have some instant coffee with creamer i am currently using this coffee with chicory it's really good we got it at the um indian market near our house i have a banana with some smuckers peanut butter this is from the vegan challenge i did i've still got some of this hanging around i might finish off this jar it's pretty sad and then i have a nice big kodiaq cake cooked in butter and we're out of syrup so i am putting this citrus strawberry jam on there this is a homemade strawberry orange jam and of course i'm always drinking a ton of water so that is my breakfast all right time for lunch i have here half a box of annie's mac and cheese with a ton of pepper on it yesterday i made this it's chicken fried tofu actually um i was just messing around with it i will definitely bring a recipe to you for that at some point i don't think it's quite right yet so i didn't film it i'm just sort of messing around and it's got a ton of cholula on it and then i have a green salad this is just the end of a box of salad not enough for two people some cucumber carrot the little um the little candied pecans and the spicy almond butter dressing from trader joe's there is lunch all right this mini grapes i still need to wash those but nice bowl of grapes honey nut cheerios and a polar seltzer for my afternoon snack it's taco night so i have two homemade flour tortillas i made some taco filling using i don't know if you can see this all the little ends from the morning star chickenless chicken strips i saved them all the little crumbles that come in each bag in a bag so they usually they come with like big strips i had to cut one up there was one big strip um but sometimes at the bottom of the bag you get all these little tiny pieces saved them all made some taco filling i have a mexican inspired slaw and a quarter of an avocado on top so that is going to be my dinner this evening all right if you have watched my channel before you know after dinner it's always time for tea and dessert today i've got the constant comment it's brewing right now which is why it looks so white with milk and sugar and a couple of these nutella slice and baked cookies they came out really well matt has already eaten two of them so i'll take that as a compliment he said he thinks they need more nutella but we'll see i don't know he like eats it by the spoonful and i am not the biggest nutella lover this probably looks familiar and that's because i'm having the exact same breakfast today um the only real difference is different peanut butter because i ate the rest of the last one i get on like breakfast kicks and then i'll eat the same thing but i'm almost out of kodiak cakes so you probably won't see this breakfast many more times all right sorry about my radiator it is really on one right now this is my lunch again no breakfast snack i ate a ton of breakfast or no morning snack i ate a lot of breakfast today and just wasn't that hungry for lunch i've got a big pile of tortilla chips some cheese slices from the costco cracker cut cheese thing i have two of each of the flavors cucumber hummus and the rest of my avocado from yesterday's dinner that i didn't finish so that's like a quarter of an avocado i guess all right since i have to go to a meeting i thought i would have lunch dessert to make myself feel better about it so i have one nutella cookie and some decaf black tea cream and sugar it's just so this is my last snack before dinner i've got my polar seltzer this is the only one i've had today i'm just still working on it and a half a bowl of grapes all right here is dinner tonight i have some rice with cheese on top and it was cooked with the better than bouillon no beef stock a bunch of roasted broccoli which of course was roasted with mushroom seasoning and garlic salt and then i roasted half of a block well like at trader joe's the sriracha tofu comes with like two pieces so i made one of those i roasted that up and i probably won't eat all this rice honestly i didn't run this morning and i'm not super super hungry so that is going to be my dinner tonight all right for dessert tonight i've got another cup of constant comment with some cream and sugar and i don't have anything baked to eat so i'm just going to eat some of these extra dark chocolate baking chips i think that'll be good this is my breakfast today i have half a cup of oatmeal with a little bit of flax seeds in there and two thirds of cup of berries i'm probably gonna add a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter on top and then i have the same coffee that i've had every day so that is going to be my breakfast today here is my lunch today i literally just finished my run so i'm not like really hungry right now but i'm sure i will be later got my daily polar seltzer two soft cooked eggs two slices of oatmeal bread i just made this um oatmeal bread and a mini cucumber i'm definitely going to eat more than this i just don't know what yet and i'm not even really hungry for the rest of my lunch i'm going to have this coconut yogurt with some peanut butter granola inside today's snack i've got some grapes and what i literally just called punishment almonds these are not very good and matt won't eat them he told me to throw them away because he they're just so garlicky um i'm gonna keep eating them i don't think they're that bad but uh it'll definitely take me a while to eat all of them as you can see it is obviously taco night round two i have basically the exact same thing as before except i used what little leftover filling i had from the other night and just added the other half of the can of beans to it so time for tea uh here i have some of the cbd golden milk cooked in coconut milk and added some honey to that so this is i'll show you it's made by the hemp division which is a um i think it's a subsidiary of harney and sons tea company last night i said i was gonna eat some of these chocolate chips and i didn't i really am gonna eat them tonight though all right so it's sunday and we have big breakfast on sunday today i've got two eggs one of the beyond sausage this is the spicy i'll let you know how that was someone commented and said they had a weird texture but i'm gonna give it a try anyway i have some hash browns for my coffee i've got this mocate this is a hazelnut flavor cappuccino mix i'm gonna have a couple of slices of pickled peaches with mine ketchup and some homemade hot sauce that is going to be my breakfast today all right here is lunch today so i've got some of that leftover slaw this is the rest of it the other quarter of my avocado from dinner last night i made a quesadilla here so i used well i used the remainder of my filling you can see some of it there and some cheddar cheese and just griddled the whole thing i'm gonna have some oh it's blue in here i'm gonna have some salsa verde on the side just for dipping so my radiator is going wild you can hear that whistle but my quesadilla did not fill me up for lunch so i'm gonna have this banana with peanut butter on top this is a huge banana so time for another snack i'm very snacky today it's like 3 15 and i was going to make dinner because i'm hungry so i'm having some honey nut cheerios with milk and probably this will hold me until i can actually make a real dinner at like a reasonable hour all right so here is what i have for dinner i have the rest of my chicken fried tofu a couple days ago i fried this but i threw it in the oven and baked it to recrisp it and i made a sweet potatoes worth of sweet potato fries i have some cholula for chicken fried tofu and of course i love ketchup i don't know about you big fan of ketchup time for dessert kind of a big dessert today i feel like i didn't eat enough for dinner so i have the rest of my grapes some herbal tea this is just like a sleepy time type tea and you know i'm gonna eat some more of these dark chocolate chips these are really tasty this is like a nice a really like kind of fancy chocolate brand [Music] all right time for another breakfast two slices of the oatmeal bread that i made a couple of days ago one with peanut butter one with butter and everything bagel seasoning i have a smoothie this smoothie has a cup of coconut milk banana a cup of blueberries some like sad mango chunks there are like three of them left and a scoop of protein powder and then i have my instant coffee with my coconut cream pretty much the same as every day all right so um i'm gonna do some meal prep today but until then i'm pretty hungry so i have half of a big honey crisp apple here i'm gonna put some peanut butter on it and that is going to be my morning snack today for lunch i have here some popcorn chicken this is a morning star fake chicken and some that's kind of a lot of potato salad now that i'm looking at it and of course i'm gonna put some ketchup on those little popcorn chickens and that's gonna be my lunch today all right same snack different day i am having some honey nut cheerios with whole milk so dinner tonight is very green uh something went wrong i tried to make a i keep trying to make a sourdough pan pizza and it won't come out right so we were going to have that and it didn't turn out so instead i pulled some pesto out of the freezer so we just have some pesto pasta a little bit of parmesan cheese on top and matt and i are splitting this bag of the romanesco blend with lemon butter sauce this is a whole foods vegetable mix we both really like this one you already know it's time for tea so i have a herbal blend of tea in here this one's really nice it's got a lot of floral like flower petals in it i'm gonna have some more chocolate chips this is like if i'm too lazy to make dessert usually we eat chocolate chips or we eat cereal [Music] today's breakfast it's kind of a big one and also please don't judge my egg so let me show you these ceramic pans we bought them at costco and we've had them maybe three months and they are extremely not nonstick i would have had a better time flipping oh jesus that's hot i would have had a better time flipping that egg in one of our cast irons so so i have one kind of still soft egg a serving of kodiak cakes half of a honey crisp apple with this kind of sad amount of peanut butter on top of my pancake i have some homemade citrus strawberry jam and my instant coffee with coconut creamer on the side so i am hungry for a snack it's still really early way too early for lunch so i'm gonna have one of these date almond joy bar things so i thought i would just come on here and say um i'm almost done filming myself everything i've eaten for the week and it's been a little bit weirder than i thought i feel a little surveilled um about my choices so uh you know please be kind in the comments i thought that this would be a fun exercise to see like how much i really spend on what i actually eat in a week and this is sort of a normal week i'm eating a normal amount of food for me um and what that means is some days i'm hungrier than others stick around stay tuned thanks so much for watching so far and let me know down below if you like this kind of video it's i probably won't do them very often but it's been a nice break to be able to just show you like when i'm not trying to make something for youtube this is what i do i make meals out of what we have on hand a lot of the times when i try things then they don't work i make something really quickly and most lunches i eat leftovers in some variety repurposed for something else or put with something new i've got my pesto pasta i almost got a little bit too crispy my green beans and this popcorn chicken which i'm just gonna mix this all together and eat it'll just look prettier like this i suppose for right now all right i don't know why i'm so chatty today okay i'm gonna eat my lunch bye time for my afternoon snack and i've got two hard-boiled eggs with salt and pepper on them a slice of my homemade oatmeal bread toasted with butter and cranberry hot pepper jam that i made a few days ago that's gonna be my afternoon snack today so here is my dinner tonight really simple roasted broccoli half a block of sriracha tofu from trader joe's that i just roasted with some mushroom powder and i made like a homemade uh rice pilaf rice-a-roni type thing all right time for dessert yes this is a funny-looking piece of cake because matt just ate out of the container he didn't cut himself a slice he just ate it out of there um so this is the like a chocolate depression cake and on top is a mix of two frostings whenever i make a um whenever i make a cake if there's frosting left over i freeze it in a bag and when i get enough of those scraps i take all of them out and whip them together and use them to frost a cake so this is a combination of a german buttercream and a chocolate swiss meringue frosting this is just a sleepy time approximate tea from t2 and that is what i'm going to finish off my night with here's my breakfast so this is my final breakfast i have two slices of my oatmeal bread that i toasted and i added peanut butter and jam this is not a homemade jam this is a reduced sugar chokeberry jam this has been open in my fridge for a while the peanut butter is just the trader joe's crunchy salted it's my favorite i have a smoothie this is just a banana a cup of mixed frozen berries about a cup of coconut milk not a full cup i just used the rest of the carton and a scoop of protein powder here's my last lunch i am having some i have half of a honeycrisp apple right here a morningstar buffalo chicken patty and two small potatoes that i cut up and made into fries now if you're curious why you almost never see morning star stuff in my grocery hauls it's because i buy them at target we go to target every couple of weeks to stock up on cat stuff and whenever they the morningstar products are on sale and there's a rebate on ibotta i buy the maximum amount so i'll buy five of them these i bought them when they were at 350 and then there was a 75 cent coupon back or a rebate back from ibada so i paid 275 for all four of them that is a good deal because usually they are four dollars here when they aren't on sale they're either four or 450 depending on what type you buy time for my afternoon snack i have i'm gonna have some tortilla chips these are the aldi chips i bought last week and the rest of the aldi pine nut hummus also i actually i actually really like this hummus it's very good so i'm gonna have some of that some of the chips and that's gonna be my afternoon snack today here's my last dinner okay i was just telling matt i'm excited to not film everything i eat anymore it feels like a lot of pressure um so we just made the melted zucchini pasta again that zucchini was still hanging out in the fridge needed to be eaten and we both really like this meal i'm having mine with some morning star chickenless chicken strips and for christmas matt got a micro green kit so we put some micro greens right on top for like some fresh herbal flavor i guess i don't know i think it'll be good okay so that's everything i eat i don't know if you were keeping track of the totals all along but the grand total that i spent this week for everything that i ate was 48.68 that averages 6.95 a day and over the course of a year that would average out to 2536.75 now my monthly grocery budget is 250 dollars so that means that there's about 40 dollars a month quote-unquote going missing where does that 40 a month go so i have been thinking about a few different things right so as a yearly budget i spend three thousand dollars first i ate almost no packaged snacks this week i worked from home the entire week which means i didn't take anything on the go with me when i do go to work i will use a packaged instant coffee which is slightly more expensive and i will eat some kind of a bar oftentimes i will take more yogurts individually packaged yogurts with me to work and those kinds of things individually packaged bags of chips we buy them at costco and i do eat them it just so happened i didn't eat any this week and that will increase my food costs extra produce so over the summer we are more than happy to eat all the produce because a ton of it is delicious and so we go to farmers markets and spend money there i eat a ton of produce whenever it's available and so i think extra produce is probably one place that some of this money goes during good farming harvest seasons lastly this didn't include like a ton of treat foods or specialty items so for a holiday for example we will go to whole foods and we'll drop like 75 just on fancy things to eat for that holiday meal obviously we will spread those out we'll eat them over a couple of weeks we don't just eat them on one day but that kind of stuff does add up oh wait there's also one other place that i think that extra four hundred dollars goes matt's diet is more expensive than mine we were in a long distance relationship for about four years and when i lived alone my grocery budget every month i would spend between 175 and 200 a month and that lines up really well with what you saw me eat here so 48.68 for the month uh for the week averages a little less than two hundred dollars for a month and uh that is in part because i don't eat meat and matt does so some of the grocery overages come from the fact that i pay for half of our groceries and matt enjoys expensive things and that's fine i do too i obviously don't try to scrimp and save every last little bit that i can okay now what cost the most out of this grocery budget i think a couple of things accounted for uh a lot of what i spent so first i ate fake meat almost every day during this week and that's not that unusual when i'm working from home secondly i ate packaged tofu from trader joe's which is costly costs a lot more than cooking it from scratch but i don't mind paying the extra for that convenience it also means that i just eat tofu more often because it's easier to make and i enjoy it okay uh that's a big wrap up on this week i am going to be doing some more grocery cost analysis over the next few weeks so make sure that if you liked this video you subscribe and um have a good one", "YyXDwc9OQ2M": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out this crumble or this bubba kush crumble by Regulator extract and with that we're gonna go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at or actually THC comes in at 60 to 0.5 they don't have a whole lot of other stuff but as you guys know I don't buy my candles based off of THC the reason I really picked this up was because it looked really good and it was a steal so I can't hi guys know I don't really mention prices so I'm not really gonna go into it but just know that this was really affordable this was definitely something that I would consider budget-friendly and I'm trying to open this right now and it's not working give me two seconds there we go alright so sorry guys I've been fighting kind of cold so if I sound a little funny I apologize all right so here we go sorry it really is that far off camera I was so as you can see this looks really really good zoom in for you guys so you can check that out let me educate this and play with it a little bit so the color that comes off on camera is about two shades lighter than the color that's in the actual like in person I would say it's a little bit darker than what you guys see here but it still looks really really good ooh as far as the scent is concerned it just has that really clean floral you know good concentrate taste but with that I'm really excited to try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up I went ahead and tried that bubba kush and as far as the flavor is concerned it doesn't have a whole lot outside of like a regular clean concentrate floral flavor then the hai itself is more of a relaxed stone enos that kind of hits the body but that leaves your brain kind of clear-headed this one was a good one I would say it was a little bit longer than I expected it to be especially for the price and then the way that we ended up smoking it for the majority of the week and I think we still have a little bit of it is we end up topping other stuff that isn't quite as strong or just like you know you dip it in you know you take your other concentrate dip it into some of this and the combination of this with other stuff has been really really really good I honestly think we might end up picking this up again just for the simple fact that if you do end up getting something else that's not quite cutting it you can just dip it into this and boom it's good to go so all around a really good concentrate if you're a newbie I would say you could probably just go ahead and try a normal-sized dab with this because it's not gonna throw you so far out of your element that you're gonna feel uncomfortable and it is gonna give you that concentrate kind of feel if you're a newbie also remember that the THC percentage isn't relevant to you any concentrate is gonna get you higher than any sort of flower that you've ever had before just because it is a concentrate so just keep that in mind when you're out there purchasing your stuff with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "mh1sbGiq7rY": "do you guys want to try some we've got some mixed up it's made with blacks liquidizer I would like to try the banana og please I love banana bananas it was like really smooth and I didn't like burn my chest but it's really like really hard as awesome ya know the flavor was good it was kind of subtle like when I exhaled I really tasted it so that was good it really tastes like banana I can take more liquidy than like some of the wax pens I had and sometimes I feel like the more like what do you want so his heart but this one pretty hard Thank You wax liquidizer [Music]", "WheOc80F8Wo": "so let's start on the left we're gonna make diamonds out of your on the right right now is we are reducing there are extract or BHO extract we like to put it inside of we got this bucket you seen the last picture it's got a little bit of warm water it is not hot water it's just warm water we're gonna reduce it down to for the diamonds we want it to become the consistency of a boat syrup before we're gonna cap it and put it somewhere warm and pretty much forget about it for a few weeks and then for adds or shatter if you don't know how to make shatter we're gonna reduce that down to about syrup then pour it into our back oven onto our patch of parchment paper and then we're gonna let it bubble away and then pull it back on it full30 an inch of warm water and on hot water just warm water in there gonna take a little while through these it's what we want - I'll be 20 minutes half an hour there like that probably have to change the water a couple times keep it warm as the extract is really cold the process to walk you through it oh yeah we can make diamond can make diamond - all right you can see how much we reduced it down your way up here before it was quite a bit lighter we still got some bubbles just good because to make time as you need pressure also need a supersaturated solution which is this butane and THC and yeah time just go wait time so we're gonna we're gonna do is when it's a little cap on this we're gonna stick it up on our clone seedling rack because it's got a it's a warm base which will help with the pressure build up because as the gas or as the liquid turns into gas it builds up enough pressure in here and helps the process take place good no it's not quite at syrup consistency yet which is okay we can just let the pressure build up give it a little burp we do that over a period of a couple days until we get it tell it's like a little run here than syrup and then we're just gonna leave the cap on it and we're not gonna touch it again till we get diamonds you can see now that I burped it there's bubbles from the gases escaping from the supersaturated solution back into gas which pressurizes this back back up again okay so it reduced a little bit more this one here we weren't working with see how runny that is I mean it's still just like water make snake water this is the death Bubba here and see it doesn't splash like that when you shake it it's thicker hard to tell you definitely a sticky substance yeah shake it doesn't splash up the sides a whole lot that's how we like it see the little bubbles coming up pressure up we're gonna leave it at that we're just gonna set it and set it forget it turn it off in the back corner here and we'll come check it in a couple weeks and we've got diamonds in the bottom there it kind of look like little air bubbles when they first start forming but their crystals will show you once we get to that point you [Music] [Music]", "B-kiYnmG_7w": "[Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] and start that again good evening everybody and welcome to tonight's kinetic cycle coach podcast i am your coach captain pilot bus driver taxi driver for the evening and i don't need to tell you what my name is because it's scott and it's in the corner of the screen as you can see so we're going to talk about carbohydrates tonight um and peter's already gone on spoiled the bubble that most cake is actually full of fat and not carbs but i might actually pop your bubble as well about your caffeine stock but anyway i'm not going to put too much all of the wind up your sails i'm going to introduce you to some ways that you may not have looked at carbohydrates before but we're essentially going to leave this session with a clear idea of what changes you're going to make okay so you're gonna love it pop in your chat pop in all your questions we'll work with way through i can see all the members in their orange strava jerseys all jumping on doesn't that look very cool hey folks you stick with me for the year you'll get up to that till the french yellow premium jersey and that brings me on to a very important topic oh i've just kicked my camera sorry about that before we actually go on and that is how do you become a member because it's not that easy is it here's silly me thinking that i would just put the join badge on apparently ios is not friendly with it and you're not going to see it on your phone you have to go to a website youtube you have to go ideally on a laptop desktop you'll find it as you can see there in the banner i'll just put my little chin where's wally oh wrong hand put that one up it's just down there you got to go on the laptop or a desktop and you'll find it i'm going to be sending out a link via email so if you're a subscriber already to the newsletter hey you're going to get that through and then you can easily follow it what you're going to get in membership are you going to get the live training sessions on the cat shop because as of this week they're all going into membership folders okay and that just keeps everything exclusive and the way i want it how much is memberships 4.99 a month so it's not you know it's not going to break the bank and that's the sort of fees that youtube set and they will get most of it i'll tell you that anyway but that's going forward from this week you're also going to get live chat where i'm going to talk about things like this deeper nutrition but also products i'll be back in my big fit studio very very soon products get thrown at me all the time from all sorts from bike components from bike fit issues bike components computers nutrition and i'll drop it into the membership group first and you will be notified when that happens okay so without further ado let's talk cake [Applause] so start dropping in your favorite cake what is it now you can start putting it in the comments get a little chat amongst yourself i'm going to break this up into a couple of little points okay uh so i want you thinking about your present habits so i'm going to go through quite a couple of things tonight so i want to talk about everything you ever wanted to know about carbs but were too afraid to ask what why what when why i was going to put the where but folks i hope you know that it's carbs in here we're not talking about supposed trees up your backside for carbohydrate uh inducing we're not talking about intravenous carbs no no no no all ones that go in your mouth so uh do you need to change so after tonight's chat i want you to go away and look now i'm going to keep it as simple as possible but i want you to look at your own structure and see if you need to change okay so i'm going to give you a bit of science to begin with folks i thought it'd be easier we get sort of a little bit sciencey get that out of the way and that'll get you thinking in terms of numbers now the most important thing is you've got to keep this simple right do not leave this podcast thinking i've got to count so many numbers i've got to get no you're going to work on feel okay but you're going to get an idea where you're at at the present and what changes you need to make so i'm going to share quite a little bit of thing so bear with me get a notepad and pen or you can watch this through i'm going to flash up some numbers flash up some foods flash up my structure and its loose terms and how we can follow that in a week okay so what about if i was to say to you uh how much so how much glycogen is in the system i'm going to use a random basic what we call janet and john figgers so muscle's going to hold round about 500 grams of glycogen glycogen remember is about an 8 to 12 chain glucose simple simple sugar that's going to break down and that's what food is going to be converted to boom straight away within about an hour believe it or not folks yeah within about an hour so let's call the average person 500 grams it's gonna range between three and seven hundred depending on the size of that person and their level of fitness yes people the fitter you get the more glycogen you can store liver we're going to have on average about 80 grams now that can range from zero to 160 yes zero we can completely deplete the lever blood okay that's not my phone single phone signal 4g that is about it okay four grams in the blood scott you're kidding is that it yeah now i'm not putting in brackets how much because i don't want to get into the realms of uh diabetes etc and all that okay so that's about it so does that give you an idea uh now before we go on does anybody know how many calories without googling it is in a gram of carbohydrate if you've been following the podcast you probably know already that you can oxidize one gram per minute roughly so i want you thinking about that and i want you thinking about what did you have or you're about to have for your evening meal okay i don't want you to count how many carbohydrates are in it but i'm going to be asking you about the volume the size the portion and when did you last eat as an athlete i want you thinking about your training and your eating in similar sorts of timelines because nutrition timing and the volume of the nutrients we take is important pre during and post okay so have a think about that keep putting in your favorite cakes yeah i've got a fetish is that are you allowed to say fetich on on youtube for certain cakes carrot cake is up there very very high but there are a few others millionaires shortbread oh a lot of fat in that though okay so with those levels what about the old coach so the cold coach weighs 64 kilograms of one carb oh i've given you the answer there four calories i'm going to go roughly four calories we talk about a flashlight if we talk about protein at four calories carbohydrate normally about three and a half three and three quarters i just round it up to four what about fat okay i'll leave you with that one how many calories in a gram of fat hmm i'll leave you with that i won't give you the answer to that one yet okay so where's the coach at so let's say coach weighs 64 grams and we take the upper limits okay so we take those sort of average we take the 500 we take the 80 and we take the 4. so i've got 584 grams of potential carbohydrate in my system if i am fully fueled so that gives me a potential of four times five eight four gives me two hundred and two thousand three hundred and thirty six calories interesting two hundred two thousand three hundred thirty six calories potential if i'm full okay so it's quite interesting you probably never thought about that how many calories have i got at the moment now we don't know because we haven't got a gasoline petrol guider when we go to eat we haven't got a bar chart on our wrist or or our leg that says hey just like your phone your three bars full scott go lie down eat 15 bits of carrot cake three kitkats bowl of pasta and you'll be okay we don't have that so we have to learn from experience now the reason i said that more people sort of the higher level of fitness you've got the higher you'll be able to hold this is all to do with lean tissue and our absorption of glycogen which changes the more training we've done so if you're a beginner and you're an absolute beginner there's something i want to go through that will be advantage for you if you're looking to lose weight okay depending on how much training you've done so you've got that amount of calorie scope what does that mean why is that going to be beneficial to me to understand well if we get a fueling issue whereby our legs start to burn our inflammation is going up our heart rates not corresponding with the effort that we feel we've got a resting heart rate that's gone up we're feeling tired we're not having a good sleep pattern all symptoms of high inflammation which are usually symptoms of somebody who's in metabolic shock or somebody who's falling under daily calories so what's my bmr it's around about 1600. so i need 1600 calories per day to break even okay to break even now my devices if i wear a heart rate monitor that's going to be very accurate for where use a power meter it's going to be more accurate and it'll tell me how many calories i'm bonding if my metrics are all correct in terms of my threshold my heart rate's ones and it'll tell me if i ride for three hours at below 80 percent ftp i will burn on average about 1600 calories okay i'll weigh out my bmr number okay so that means i'm depleting the carbohydrate in my system so it means i have to replace it i've talked about this before if you do not replace it and we'll go through replacement numbers in a second if we don't replace it and replace it pretty quick okay within the first hour we must get a particular percentage normally 1 to 1.3 grams ideally that's 60 to 90 grams a little bit more than what we would normally take if we were training in that first hour then we're going to be in trouble because we're going to always be playing catch up and what will happen to some people is they'll feel it on the second day or they may even feel it on the third or the fourth day and there'll be a huge slump of fatigue a big pinprick and a balloon and they will blow up they'll feel irritable they will have a poor sleep pattern poor concentration lots of symptoms that are unique to them some will be more than others we can have five people that are in metabolic shock and they'll all behave slightly different but they'll mainly be editable poor energy levels lack of motivation lots of fatigue so i want you to think now here am i falling into that trap because i'm trying to lose weight so i'm i'm i'm counting my calories now if your muscle and liver let's say your total glycogen let's keep it simple falls to 50 so let's say it falls under 250 grams that's it okay it's game over you will not be able to fuel properly the reactions needed in the muscles to actually train to hit the new levels to actually push your fitness you'll still be able to move but you'll go slower you'll feel sluggish there'll be very heavy legs not good eh not good all because you're trying to cut back on the calories you're putting in now remember what i said at the start protein is going to give you the same amount of calories in fact it's a little bit more per gram than carbohydrate the reason we use carbohydrate first is the the the bonds between the glucose the carbons are really really easy to break down so it breaks down fast then protein fats complex it takes about four times as much oxygen to break down a gram of fat than it does to break down a gram of carbohydrate so it doesn't like going there very simple it just wants smooth efficiency so we'll go for what's ready fast then it'll go for the proteins then it'll go for the fats once you start using protein game over and as far as training goes absolute game over so if for example you are somebody who uh i would say belongs to the clan of there's a scottish clan called mcmoron yeah the mcmorons tend to follow things that are quite trendy and in sports terms having something that has a no sugar or no glucose that this is going to be okay for a small period of time and then before you go start crazy you start chewing on your fingers you start eating uh books and pencils you start trying to get anthony that's the mcmoron clan yeah we don't want to become part of that because how can we chemically induce the reactions needed for sport if we haven't got a fully loaded muscle and liver system of of carbohydrate i.e glycogen now remember all foods going to get broken down into that within an hour to four hours you're already storing a lot of it as fat okay oh scott don't mention that word that's that's a bad word okay we'll come to that don't worry don't worry right so get that in your head are you feeling enough for the exercise so if you're a beginner and you're looking to lose weight one tip keep your right short don't go beyond the two-hour point whereby fuel is going to start running out okay so we'll get on to timing a second but this may be of like total uh oh scott you're swearing at me i love those long rides but if we're going to do the long rides you're going to have to fuel with carbohydrates quite a lot of them okay so where did we get to so uh carbohydrates we rushed through this you know where they can i want to do this as a little example i want you to look closely at them and see what happens when i go through all the groups now i'm going to share my my 100 best foods with you as well some of you have seen it before and where we get them so carbohydrates fruits grains or beans veg sugary sweets yeah milks day oh milk it's got dairies yeah cycling specific sport food i call it this is essential for me so this is something i will have in my diet especially in protein what about fats so dairy products would that include milk scott oh might do yeah seeds nuts oils meat if you're a meat eater uh tofu i'm talking about things that are quite common to me and then let me see what about what have i missed your favorite facts okay oh no i've done that i mean proteins oh oh look scott milk's prepared again dairies okay it's meats lentils seafood for me this is where my sports product would come in as well because i'm not getting enough protein in my my daily diet as well and i know that okay right so i'm going to say one thing here confused that there are items in multiple categories you should be confused because it is very confusing and i think sometimes the media make it confusing for you so that you're going out and buying their products because they will give you an answer to everything and one of the most confusing things is at the moment the i think even toothpaste has got protein in it i think if they could get away with it coffee with protein tea bags with protein everything's got protein in it at the moment well we want protein but we're getting quite enough of that we want carbohydrates and we want them to be able to fuel okay so really important where are you getting yours confusing i've put dairy products and all of them is called how do i know how good the carbohydrate is how do i know that i'm getting enough you're going to do on feel to begin with because there's a couple of things we'll go through in the summary because start of it you know where you're at don't you you know what your metrics are what your weight is your fat muscle and water because remember when we take on carbohydrates let's say for every gram of carbohydrates we take on four times as much water so when i talk about carbohydrates i'm going to talk about fluid retention i'm going to talk about let's call it puffy puffiness you know you're going to puff up with a lot of carbohydrates and you're going to need them when you're going into bigger events longer events before and after but there's nutritional timing okay where you turn that all off and you'll flush that out and particular types of efforts we do we'll flush that out oh scott you're talking so fast slow it all down like let me summarize that so your carbs can come from more than just carbohydrates so foods that you see as carbohydrates don't let the media confuse you we're going to get them but we're going to get them in different levels so you've all heard of starchy carbohydrates yeah more complex carbohydrates things like our porridge potatoes forms of pasta so these are slow releasing carbohydrates okay now for for those slow releasing ones they're not actually ideal for us pre-exercise because they're going to take a lot more oxygen to break down and be a bit slower okay so what's going to happen when we have a high influx of your favorite cake so let's say what we got we've got all sorts of cakes going in there french gingerbread oh i like the sound of that so you know that when we get sugar we get spiking insulin okay that insulin then will drop and we can that can come with a feeling of safe fatigue so say you go into your coffee stop and you're really looking forward to your favorite cake which let's be honest folks hasn't it's got full of carbohydrates but it's also full of fats okay now when you have it and then you set about talking about hey did you see that guy scott mclean that podcast what a funny he is oh he goes on and on and on he talks about that he start talking away 10 minutes has passed 50 minutes past suddenly your insulin spike's gone boom down deflated you go back on the bike you think oh my god it's always hard when you leave the cafe bobby isn't it oh i know jimmy oh my legs are just killing me yeah i don't want to like blow like a raspberry to your cafe stop but if you're looking to maximize a coffee stop and you're out with some friends when lockdown finishes do it very close to home okay not many people do that we'll go halfway and we'll have a nice big catch up then we'll put her on back not if you're training you're not you'll probably want to go hard okay so bear that in mind all right that's just a little side point we'll save for another little chat so anyway i want you to think about that the volume in the in the muscles we've got four calories per gram how do we know that we're we're fully stored okay well we're going to have to experiment with some workouts and how we feel and how we perform okay but if you are in a position right now where you're counting calories and for a woman if you're under that 1200 a day and for a man if you're under 1400 a day  okay in fact it's working that is if you're in that party and you belong to the mcmoron clan and you've fallen into that trap then you've got to make sure that that is not a training day and you're doing shorter workouts to accommodate the weight loss okay now doing weight loss and specific cycling i'll touch on it but it's a it's a different a total different topic okay but you'll pick up from when i talk about uh timing let me let me go into say looking at uh a typical week yeah so let's go through sort of a week let me let me share something like this so that this is not uh this is not rocket science i don't want to give too much away because obviously okay i like to share all the real juicy stuff with my team kinetic people but let's look at the coach so monday off so what we're doing on a monday well we're rolling over from the sunday breakfast uh will be no extra carbs needed for that breakfast and i'll start on a monday by adding more fats and proteins into the diet because i don't need the carbs on monday all right i don't need as much pm i'll start to add a little bit more carbs okay tuesday uh there's gonna be high intensity 90 minutes zone four zone five hard work okay so we have double breakfast now what does a double breakfast mean it means what time do you get up so my breakfast will be consumed porridge okay normally quite a large bowl okay one full cup and not a half cup there'll be honey added as well and that will be consumed between 6 30 and 6 45 definitely before seven o'clock every morning so therefore when there is a morning training i will do an easy uh ride on an indoor bike after never ever before i do not want to get into fasted riding i'll do it after and then what will happen that may be half an hour okay it doesn't happen every tuesday but about half an hour 40 minutes then i'll do a double breakfast around about 10 o'clock i'll have another breakfast that might be specific carb loaded so it may be something like a piece of toast or flatbread with jam okay i'll avoid putting flora or butter and i'll be jam and i'll just have that around about that ten o'clock time now now what i am doing is i am now eating in court in coordination with cycling using the two hour rule to keep my carbohydrate levels as high as possible i am assuming that even when i'm off the bike i am dipping into those stores and i'm burning a lot of them every two hours and i'm falling under so i have it in my head i'll go to half every 200 every two hours sorry and i'll build it back up wednesday so if we look in the evening i do what's called a later carb lunch and then i follow the two-hour rule so we'll come back to the two-hour real soon a pm is a sports protein after the training and with some carbs no large meal nope that doesn't happen i'll pick that up in the very next day so breakfast is normal wednesday we follow family meal protocol okay for me so that's a normal meal so there's nothing extra happening on a wednesday uh depending on how i feel or what i've replaced there is quite a large lunch now thursday i'll normally do hard the longer efforts again 90 minutes maybe two hours so again i follow double breakfast because there may be a session fee in the morning just to activate again there's later carb lunch and then the two-hour rule and then again i don't have an evening meal okay so i don't have it doesn't matter if i'm got time eight o'clock i just avoid it i'll have a sports protein shake and i will have some carbs maybe in a bit of a slice of toast maybe some cereal friday's off so i have my similar routine to monday but then i start to add more carbs in the evening saturday will normally be two to four hours hard push and basically i call it the world car buffet you know eat all you want trying to get as many carbs in as possible pre i will make sure that the breakfast is consumed within the two-hour period of going out but i'll also have a liquid about an hour before i'm going out as well and then there's high carbs in the evening high carbs in the morning sunday's an easy session and then we shift the proteins and fats after five o'clock sunday night as i start to fully recharge and get into recovery mode okay now monday i may do a simple little ride and i may just turn the legs now does that seem complex it shouldn't do i want you to go and look at your weekly schedule when are you having breakfast i don't have breakfast scott well the mcmoron bus will come by your house and it will collect you and it will take you to mcmoron clap camp where you can live happily with all the other morons now make sure you're having breakfast is it consistent what are you consuming for breakfast is it a light breakfast or are you making sure that you're really fueling up because remember if the two-hour rule of expenditure of carbohydrates when we're out on the bike is used in your head scott sleep is eight hours six hours so we've gone through three or four cycles with no fuel so i want you to imagine that you are waking up with your glycogen muscle and liver and blood stores below 50 so it's impossible to do a high intensity effort and people say to me can i do a high intensity effort in the morning yeah but you won't necessarily get the numbers that your fitness deserves because you haven't got the the volume of glycogen okay you got that so start getting some sensible thinking in your head you don't need to go googling everything you don't need to go you just need to understand that this is what my body needs this is where it's bundling up and this is how i'm going to replace it so you start to look at your schedule and you see when am i having lunch what am i having for lunch when am i having my meals is there a big gap i want you to become sherlock holmes look at your eating pattern don't look at what you're eating at the moment look at when you're eating is there a gap of more than two hours well of course there is scott i have my lunch at one o'clock and i don't eat even a meal to seven o'clock you telling me you go six hours without eating think about that is that smart what's happening to your fuel stores during that six hours now as you train you increase lean muscle if you're really smart about it you're doing lean muscle exercises every single day lean muscle is going to allow you to do what store more glycogen yes build the stores up because i've just told you that glycogen stored in the muscle and the liver but most of it in the muscle four grams in the blood a banana is 20 grams so you're getting like a quarter of it stored in the blood okay but people will continue to saturate the blood but not use it but we'll come on to that right so but think okay those gaps in your meals okay is it sensible no is it breaking away from traditional thinking for you hell yeah of course it is because that's that's not what we do with the family always eat at this time when we cook and we do this and we do that i want you thinking about if you could eat six times a day eight times a day right i'll leave that with you okay right welcome andrew i saw that pop up there new subscriber did you like that fancy little graphic yeah that was quite clever wasn't it not too sure uh how that did that can you see how i've hold on i've kicked my camera there and it's gone off there can i move that back let me uh yeah i don't know what i did there kicked my camera right let me look now at looking at how we're going to replace so let me talk a little bit about uh where we're going to get these replacements so what's going to happen how best should i replace my carb stores so thinking about uh the the timing so let's say a couple of things so your long ride this is a ride that's going to go over two hours i talk about 90 minutes for older athletes in my category say over 50. 90 minutes if we start to go for two hours you are going to deplete now here's the rate of depletion if the ride is on average more than eighty percent of ftp okay eighty percent of ftp are above which let's face it for a lot of people is not that much they'll go out in a group ride with some friends and they'll just ride like idiots okay as we say in the trade they'll be measuring each other's wellies without pulling the shots down okay load of nonsense it's not productive to a really structured train plan it's okay now and then if it's under the the 80 then fueling takes place quite naturally right you'll get your 60 to 80 grams in the first hour afterwards and then you'll have the next 24 hours believe it or not to fill up those stores now if the ride is much harder and it's say over the two hours as well you will need to increase quite dramatically now in elite terms we would go all the way to 8 to 10 grams 8 to 10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight over the next 12 hours wow it's quite a lot it is a lot because you've got so much to replace if i've got stores of 2336 i've got to get that back in plus my bmr plus i'll be running what's called epoch burning at a higher temperature can you see how easy it is even when you think you're quite disciplined to fall under and then suddenly three days five days a week later you just got this almighty fatigue because you're not quite getting the carbohydrates and you're starting to use proteins for fuel you're exercising far too hard at the moment to use fat for fuel okay it's just not going to happen and there are too many other stores of of glycogen and protein available for you to get into getting to fat okay so the conundrum is scott how am i going to lose weight okay how am i going to manage to lose weight well the thing is you're burning so many calories way more than your app is actually telling you that you will gradually as long as we clean up our diet so let's follow a nice structure use the template i've given you there from how i run my week when is breakfast i try and keep it as consistent a time of day with almost to the minute okay i know that sounds a little bit anal but almost to the minute and it's as quick as i get up i don't get up and wander around and allow my body to start activating and get used to not having you because as soon as it goes there people that's a bad place to get to because therefore when carbohydrates do come in okay it will burn them but it will be holding on to fat more and you are very unlikely to get rid of that fat if you're falling into that trap so when people who are overweight tell me oh i try everything to lose weight but i'm still holding on to all this fat they've got the most ludicrous eating pattern whereby they're starving themselves and then gorging so we'll come to that because that's really important for an athlete that we avoid that at all costs i've already told you think of the two hours okay think what have you had to eat in the last two hours or two hours going forward okay so you finish your ride we normally fall into the 1 to 1.2 1.3 grams okay if you just stick with say 60 to 80 grams now you need the you need the protein so take your protein shake you're going to get 20 grams get that dealt with in the first 20 30 minutes take an hour make sure you get that 60 to 80 grams of carbohydrate but if your ride has been over two hours you must have fueled on the bike because if you do doing even if you think well i'm only two hours scott it's not too bad remember you've depleted the existing stores so when you come off and you have your little bit you're nowhere near getting back to the level of storage you need what does this do it has a hormonal effect on you it will make you more hungry to eat rubbish you'll find yourself constantly snacking because you've not really satisfied the missing calories that the training has taken out if you want to progress you've got to get into good habits so that might mean that all you would need is say 40 to 60 grams for a two hour ride if you can't work that out just take a a sports liquid i would always say a liquid ahead of a bar because a lot of bars they are full of fats okay and a lot of gels have got crazy suspension uh solutions so they may be quite acidic so you've got to experiment you can make your own things from oats and dried fruit and honey and natural products okay and you can have a fair idea from the components that you make it with what the percentage is okay start to experiment with that now what about when you start to replace them you may become fearful have i eaten too many have i eaten too much well we can have a a pro athlete try to absorb 8 grams to 10 grams per kilogram over the next few hours remember you can only oxidize one gram per minute of carbohydrate okay so if we go over that we will store them but if you're training again the following day it's better to have excess levels because you are going to use them up now if you do have excess levels you will feel it okay you feel a little bit bloated you may feel that your your water retentions much so again that gives you an idea here i took too much but i'm going to now use it because what if i was to say to you this what if the antidote was training time so if i said i want you eating every two hours i want you having a carb source as your main fuel but you're going to train more wow can i do that can i train more because that's the antidote because the trouble with modern society is carbs make the most of their diet especially through processed foods but the one to four hour time scale for it to be stored used is missed so it's stored and not used so it's continually topped up so a very unfit overweight person yeah it's going to have high stores of glycogen but they haven't got the casio cardiovascular system to go out and burn all that off so they fall into this trap becomes very difficult by not exercising they lose lean tissue so they're stores of how they actually store glycogen is gone so they're suitcases to go in holiday they become tiny they can't take anything with them they can't take glycogen if you improve your lean tissue you improve your suitcase size that'll let you fill up one suitcase full of money yeah full of money that's great and it doesn't matter you don't have to have bulking muscles not like me you know you don't have to be built like me or arnold schwarzenegger or that but you're going to be able to store more fuel and it's regardless of what age you are don't be telling me i'm 50 i'm sexy i can't put muscle on it's harder but you can't do it you discipline yourself to 10 15 minutes a day exercises i'm not talking about going to the gym i'm talking about isometric body resistance exercises it can be done okay so i'm aware that i'm rushing through things quite a lot here let me go to uh i was going to look at the antidote let me let me try and summarize uh i was going to talk about top foods yeah so remember i showed this before i've talked about here so in this list of foods that this would be one this helps me cleanse this keeps inflammation down for my ulcerative colitis so these are great foods and green are the top top foods so something like you know i can see they are you know turmeric amazing uh broccoli blueberries cranberries pineapples chips all these foods they will really help me cleanse and keep the diet low in inflammation because the training is causing the inflammation so what i want you thinking about is look at what you're having for breakfast now you can have the same thing every day look at what you're having for your lunch where are the carbs where are the proteins but where are you getting those simple carbs and can you load up on carbs going into training and can you tidy up in that first 20 minutes to hour afterwards and get the stores back in now here's the big game changer can you eat six to eight times a week could you try it for a week and see if it helps but you've got to make one big change people you've got to make the most drastic change but especially in the uk i see people cannot make and that is to reduce your portion size almost by half to eat less why because i've told you the body will oxidize one gram per minute so if you look at your plate and it's got over the volume of carbohydrates really needed you're going to find it harder to break them down and store them in that one sitting it can cause you stomach upset if we eat too much now you may be in a position whereby you already know that but you don't change your habits so to increase the volume of food in calories we must decrease portion size and this is it's not rocket science uh but it's so difficult for people to do if you look at the two-hour rule so if i said to someone oh yeah i had my lunch scott at one o'clock and i didn't eat against seven o'clock that's because they've been eating snacks they've been dipping into a chocolate here or there because hormonally their body's all over the place because it can't go that long glycogen is beginning to deplete and the body's saying hey we're in that crazy little position again so let's start to store the fat and let's use anything else and suddenly proteins getting used and you're in such catabolic phase from the training that your proteins are re-synthesizing all the time so you've got to take in the amino acids because you're not producing them naturally but you're messing with that because you're not eating properly so that's the biggest change smaller portions more often and by doing that you clean up your metabolic rate you'll actually burn more calories and you'll be able to eat foods that you quite enjoy so it's i know it sounds crazy so what you've got to do is one what are your metrics today what's your weight what's your fat percentage what's your muscle percentage and what's your present hydration level yeah you may have to spend a little bit of money on a set of scales get yourself an app that may measure it for you okay something that allows you because if you're serious about it you'll make that investment i'm not talking about a lot but you'll get those metrics and you'll start to understand how to tweak them your scales if they can take those measurements they'll give you a basal metabolic rate your daily intake you'll be able to then create a bmi then you start to look at your food intake and you start to understand well i need to make sure if i'm on the same as scott i'm 500 muscle um 80 and leather and 4 in blood so let's work that out here you know let's work out the calories i'm going to have available because if you get it right and you lead into your key session correctly fueled you will explode you will push the numbers that you never thought possible okay never thought possible so what's this two hour rule scott that you mentioned as well the two-hour rule obviously i've talked about two hours between meals i've talked about two others of stored fuel okay now if you're going out you're gonna go over the two hours you would start fueling again about an hour you would use what you've had for breakfast or the last meal that would take you through the first hour and then you start if you're gonna go over now there's two hours pre-training now the two hours pre-training some coaches will talk about three hours for solid food i like to go to two hours but two hours okay we would start to introduce liquids you would try and avoid anything solid look at the texture of the food and think about its digestibility think about how it's going to be digested and you would try and avoid that so you try and keep now i've talked about this today with a few athletes if you look now at a lot of modern sport and we look especially soccer football we see it in the uk and we see across europe when a substitute is about to come on you will see many of them and i've seen in the uk and the english premiership a lot of them taking an sis jail the very second they put themself on the pitch take it throw it away now we used to always ask the athlete to put the gels up the shots to keep them warm and take now the trouble with taking a gel if you get it wrong is the timing if you take it too far out from the explosion of the exercise you'll have an insulin spike and dip they'll take it going on to the pitch why because they're about to explode into anaerobic aerobic exercise so it can work they can give you that extra little top up of the battery so it's like having your phone at 95 percent but i'm going to go better at 100 boom we do it you can maybe start to experiment with that on your key workouts that you would have that say we do the warm-up and then just a couple of minutes before take it boom off you go on a hard workout maybe you're doing an hour session and you've got to 45 minutes and you always tend to flag i would have it then as well so start to do things that completely are different for you whereby you're feeling during some of your shorter but harder when we're doing ftp plus efforts when you know fuel is burning like throwing paper on a fire okay so again you start to do that so that's that two hours before there's the two hour ride then there's the two hours after so what happens when you're you've done your long ride you've followed protein you've had 20 grams within the first 20 minutes scott you've you've then done 80 grams of carbs in that first hour and then later on there you start to feel fatigued heavy-legged etc remember your fitness level will have an effect as well but you've got to then introduce the grazing constantly grazing what you're going to graze on can you graze on vegetables and salads to get carbohydrates of course you can so think about where you're getting your carbohydrates because when i say about cleansing your diet most people don't need to make too many changes to the diet they just need to cut out some of the  okay and like it's not rocket science you just look on your cupboards and think about the things you go to when you're hungry because you're thinking oh that'll put me off i'm going to have my my evening meal soon why if you're hungry you need to eat because if you're training and you're falling hungry and you're there for below the 50 stored fuel you're not training you're just burning more energy because you can't train because you can't hit the high numbers it sounds easy doesn't it for a lot of people it's very difficult it's very difficult to get their head around consuming more to lose weight consume more you'll burn more and you'll start creating more lean tissue and as soon as you tip that metric scale in the favor of lean tissue you're on a winning roll suddenly lean tissue goes up volume of stores carbohydrate goes up your absorption rate goes up so you can store even more you'll burn even more at a faster rate and suddenly you'll be able to maintain a healthy weight because most people if they go on a scale that measures metrics will have fat higher than muscle okay that's not a good place to be in okay so you start to look at that number you start to play around with that and you start to play so i'm not saying lose weight change body shape but put on more muscle okay and we're not asking about big bulky muscle we're talking about fiber recruitment i could talk all night about it folks okay it's so so simple to make it complex let me go through again metrics look at your metrics then look at your weekly routine when's your breakfast do you need to take extra how are you fueling two hours out from a session how are you feeling during a session and then how are you feeling 20 minutes and two hours after the session okay is there a feeling of depletion in the legs heavy legs fatigue levels for sleeping irritability if you're falling into that there's a fueling issue and where are you getting your carbohydrates from okay think about the foods that showed up you can go back through this podcast and rerun them okay i forgot to put my little light on behind me i've got lots of shadows it doesn't matter does it but think about where you're getting them from okay and can you clean that up there's so many things to do almost like there's a year's worth of work there honestly there's not much because you would just do one thing at a time i think for most people getting their metrics a starting point what percentage of fat what percentage of muscle have i got let's take it now ground zero let's start today where's that at okay now i saw some things mission fly up there about intermittent fasting so uh fasting has there's been a lot of research on fasting i'm not a fan of it folks so it's not something that like i say if you want to lose weight and use cycling as your means of exercise don't train just cycle keep it 80 below ftp and then burn your calories that you need to bond and then replace with really sensible fuel but still follow the two-hour rule but if you want to train while fasting yeah what you're trying to gain from it that you can actually then utilize fat for energy i want you to think about that i've told you that it takes four times as much oxygen for one gram of fat to be utilized into oxygen than it does for carbohydrate seriously you want to use four times as much oxygen oxygen is gold it's diamonds it's it's currency so why would you then expend four times as much how many calories are we going to get in fat have you worked it out yet you get double don't you you get eight well the four for from so okay scott well if i get double but it's taking four times as much oxygen so it's much harder why would you want to do a cycling event okay now if you're out to to be let's say odax or cycle 100 miles very very slowly yes i would have a small argument for being able to utilize fat but very rarely because in cycling it's about speed like you expect getting from a to b as quick as you can and you're going to be going far too quick at 80 85 90 revolutions per minute to use fat so yes intermittent fasting or any program like that if you want to lose weight but do not train just exercise there is a difference people okay so just follow an exercise program uh let me go through uh any other questions can i just scroll back folks everybody talking about their case rice cakes as many people put that rice cakes you can get the most exquisite rice cakes now you can even make them so you can make a rice cake peanut butter in it and a bit of honey it's fantastic experiment with a fuel and foods foods that you like okay uh another quite popular advocates never dieting while on a bike if anything over fuel well riding like whoa that's exactly uh i think i'm just of said that we exercise to get fit and we cleanse our diet to to try and lose weight we don't exercise to increase calorie bond in order to lose weight okay we don't train it's impossible to train i want you to just think of that in basic primary junior school science chemical reaction is oxygen glycogen energy okay internal respiration or external respiration even in plants that's it you want to mess around with that and create anaerobic exercise well what have you got you've got five seconds of fuel it's not gonna take you very far okay without glycogen without oxygen five seconds yeah okay i could be rude then says something else but i won't porridge half full cup of dry uncooked yes we're about that we're on the same wavelength there peter but anyway let me go back through that uh if that helped uh i don't know if it did but that's that kind of idea so you can go back through the chat and you can look at that and you can see you can see if that helps that idea so you can see what i'm doing now that's rough okay that's just a rough idea of the schedule okay it's oh it's it gives me a pattern but what happens is i've done it for long enough that it's kind of inducted into my brain so let's say you get to tuesday tomorrow we'll be doing the live show for members yes we'll be kicking on at seven i'll jump on the bike about half past six so that gives me a window from half past four nothing solid so that means that lunch will be there'll be breakfast there'll be a second breakfast lunch i can have lunch mainly people 11 o'clock to half past 11. yeah and then i'll have another meal sort of mid-afternoon and then depending because there'll be no evening meal tomorrow there'll be a lunch there'll be another meal run about four o'clock and then i'll do the protein shake and something soft afterwards it's a mindset it's a shift to traditional ways of of eating but if you have smaller amounts more often i promise you you'll not only train better but you'll feel better hey look i'll put the light on oh scott is so good yeah it's so professional yeah but i forget everything right anyway how was that give me some feedback folks uh what do you want uh i want to create easy shareable information that we can put in little packages and share it out so that you've got the idea how would we build lean muscle well we're talking about you're going to build it on the bike the legs will start to increase muscle but you've got to get into a program i'm going to i'm going to share a program of squats and press-ups using your own body weight really really simple but if you stick to it let's give it i might do one of those 30-day challenges and get people to sign up and we'll do it for 30 days uh i'm going to be doing some workouts again for team members we're going to have one on thursday uh thursday evening i ran a bit before i do my workout just a short one about 10-15 minutes i'll pop it on the on the video and we're going to do a simple little body resistance posture for bike fitting a couple of exercises okay we'll do that so i'll put a little chat out on that and members can see that so it's fairly straightforward uh for weight loss more insulin resistance etc insulin resistance yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm definitely guilty of eating too much too close to a ride yeah you if you can get into the habit of testing yourself just try it once do it in an indoor session alan so you don't you know you're not going to go too far something that i notice if i've got it wrong is my blood pressure will drop and you'll feel that you just feel a little bit sickly a little bit uh lightheaded you're just not motivated for it you know immediately to fix that a lot of people are very easy to digest liquid carbohydrates that we can add to water okay so they can be very very useful to get to get used but i would rather someone whose training is over carbs because you are going to burn so many and then you monitor your metrics okay you if you feel as if you are put on weight you just need to train more so if i said the antidote is training time okay i didn't say about the intensity just time you can train more and you will feel like it okay you will feel like it and then if we get into training of course a rider must have a a lower and an upper end you know training's not all the same intensity that's just ridiculous the body doesn't work all the energy systems don't work that way so that has to be but if you can avoid uh dieting and training it just doesn't work impossible i would go over all the time let me see what we got okay so if you're doing a longer ride plus two hours do you begin eating say banana after about 30 minutes yeah 30 to 60 minutes yep and you might take that banana at 30 minutes nikki but you may be maybe broken into three so it's 25 grams would last so you don't have it all in one go yeah you get one gram per minute but remember it's about 25 grams so try and have it in sections so you just take a bite in the pocket 15 minutes take another bite on the other take another and you just keep ticking along it's very easy to forget most riders oh forgot to do it put a sticker on your bike or something or put some notification just tell yourself right and you if you've got say a bar you've made break it up into pieces that you'll be able to get into your mouth one mouthful that's it and just chew this is a lot easier to do than people make out it just takes planning it's not about running out the door can't find your your helmet suddenly you're out you've only got oh i've only brought one bottle i needed two i forgot my all buy something at the shop well what you're normally going to buy is something say like a uh a snickers bar or a mars bar this is not the best it's going to be okay but it's got a lot more fat in it than what you need okay and that's just going to upset your your diet in terms of your nutrition plan okay uh yeah or send scott you mentioned tips for getting rid of carb bloating oh yeah sorry that's a very good peter yeah so okay so you notice on monday when i say switch off the carbs so what we we can do is one key thing to remove any excess fluid that you're holding is go down to zone one and then you would spin high cadence zone one keep the heart rate really really low but keep it around about 45 to 55 never any more than 60 ftp and at that low intensity physiologically you're not going to put too much damage into the system in terms of building fitness but what you will do is you will get into the lymphatic system and that's where it's stored okay peter it's in the lymph so anything that's going to help us with the lymphatic system so even if you watch crappy tv you'll see a lot of massaging to try and ease out the lymphatic system so having one of those sort of a mot massage as well you know maybe you wouldn't lock down finishes you have a sports massage you may have you can see i've got my ferrogun okay this is really good for shaking up the system and helping flush the way i use it but zone one basic recovery and it's i mean it's 45 50 55 ftp if you go on my strava and you see anything recently i've been sharing them with some people and they're called spinney or reading they're so low that you can read so i'll go on and i'll read text or i'll read the research paper sent to me and i'll do that and this helps with the excess carbs i'll always have excess carbs because they're easier for me to digest and i'll flush them out that way and you'll feel it yourself once that fluid goes but keep an eye on your metrics peter keep an eye on that fluid if you're able to do it okay and that gives you an idea because when people shout yeah i lost half a stone did they you know it's mainly just that excess fluid because now i would love to do a session on carb loading for those of you who are leading into say longer events or longer training sessions or maybe we're going to do many training camps i'm doing one next week or i'm putting a number of riders through a mini training camp can go abroad so we'll manipulate a three day into four day overload okay whereby we'll really bomb four hours five hours per day so this can be this can be helped with a carb loading plan whereby we'll deplete carbs add more and so on and it can really really help uh yeah my zone one yeah zone one as we know physiologically it's not gonna have a massive effect on capillary density but even in zone one it's so low that glycogen will hang about and go hey i'm not really needed that much you're breathing in so much oxygen at this low level that you can't actually use fat this works if you're super fit so the fitter you get it's a bonus isn't it you get all these perks you'll burn fat in zone one okay an unfit person won't necessarily why because they've got others floating about uh glycogen they'll probably get out of breath much quicker but as fitness increases but they keep it soft the trouble is as fitness increases what do people normally do they go faster all the time so they miss out in these wonderfuls it's interesting how a pro trains like a pro and an amateur tries to train like a pro but ends up worse because they just don't have the the mindset to go slow to go fast to go faster everything's got to be done okay right got that aubrey nice for you to be on failing to plan yeah planning to fail says you know as we always say piss poor planning piss poor performance yeah you're going to control some variables my my goal for you is not to over complicate it don't count calories as much as you think you need to just look at your diet look at when you're having your meals and cut out the crap anything that's in a cardboard box is processed anything you're getting from a takeaway shop is processed can you cut them out for 28 days can you go home 28 days and say right no treats from the takeaway and i mean everybody in the house let's let's have a go let's see if we can do it we'll make our own treats here and then let's look at things that i know are not adding clean carbohydrates let's look at crisps okay those potato chips snacks can we go a month without them just cut them out by doing one thing like that amazing now i'm not saying go and and then throw out all the wine bottles all the gin and all the you know that's entirely up to you but what you've got to understand is if you're really desperate to make the gains and you've tuned in to listen to me ran on there's something in you that's warrior-like so you're really looking to make those gains okay right what do you think about high carb versus low fat versus high fat versus low carb like keto uh pesh sorry i think it's great if you want to lose weight but don't exercise on it do not exercise on low sugar or no sugar as i've just said if you miss carbs it's you're going to not only uh can i show you evidence about key mineral uh depletion on on keto diets that affect even information processing can you imagine that somebody say to you if you follow that diet you may actually interfere with your information process and decision making it will make you you know like let's not go there sure you're going to lose weight you lose a ton of weight but remember weight stays off how if we change body composition and increase muscle tissue people who fluctuate in weight who lose mass lose a consistent volume of muscle and fat at the same level without reversing that and putting on lean muscle you'll be in the same trap you'll just put the weight back on okay i know that sounds harsh but you've got to do the exercise and get build up the resistance so in terms of me as a sports scientist and as a coach i cannot advocate removing carbohydrates from your diet removing sugar okay i can't do that because carbohydrates are few and if you look at the sensible ones people tend to think of them as sweets and and what is high sugar does anyone know what what what deems something low sugar in both food and drink it's a very simple number to follow okay it's 5 grams per 100 grams if it's under or on five grams it's deemed as low sugar and if it's uh five is same millimeters milliliters for liquid okay five grams per hundred so next time you look at some of your foods look at how they split the sugars up as well if it's if it's if it saves more sugar it should be under five okay but eh it's not gonna help you fuel do not pick up an energy gel and look for it to be under five grams most of them are going to have 20 grams of carbohydrate in them okay uh liked it liked it nikki thanks very much okay folks so can i just recap on the membership you're not going to be able to join if you're ios on a phone

through all the chat uh sep i've just seen that did i miss that i start to eat after 30 to 45 minutes two bars an hour 40 to 50 grams carbs yeah so we've gone through that was that answering uh to nicki's question yeah if you know that you're going to be out for three four hours you make sure and remember your cool down period when you start say it's 10 or 20 minutes it's the start of the next session so when i do the saturday hard session and i roll into the sunday session during the cooldown that's my 20 minutes when i'm off the bike i'm starting to replace then so there'll be a there'll be 60 grams uh normally started and finished by the time i've i've washed or dried down the bike in that period okay and that starts to help thanks very much folks thanks john okay folks uh i'm going to sign off on that i hope that was beneficial i'm going to come back to this we're going to do a little bit more work on it and i'm going to talk about carb loading and how that can help but please

30 challenge live from my garage um today i'm going to show you um i got a lot of questions about the slam ball also known as a medicine ball that i showed in my video from yesterday so i thought i would talk about that and then we will go through a full day of eating and since it's day five we're still on week one of the keto rewind clean 30 challenge and i'm loving that so many people are finding this meal plan super easy doable and i am so excited that we're all doing this together so first things first if you are not sure where to find the recipes and all that from today just click the the blog post down in the description box below or go to ketorewine.com so anyways let's talk about the medicine ball or the slam ball i'm gonna flip the camera around here okay so what is a slam ball essentially a slam ball is a big ball that's i think it's filled with sand or maybe some really high density foam or something but this ball weighs 40 grand 40 pounds or 18.2 kilograms so what's the cool thing or what why would you want to use a slam ball it is an awesome all body workout with something so small and it takes up very little room that it totally can be a full body workout now i if you're familiar with crossfit you might have seen these used also there's a father you know like those circuits that gyms and stuff sometimes will incorporate a medicine ball or slam ball and you basically do you know your squats your burpees your you know those full body exercises abdominal crunches everything using the slam ball or medicine ball so i am new to the slam ball i don't have a workout for you yet but i'm going to be working on this routine of mine for the next week or so and then once i have something down that i like i'll film it and show you so point being move your body this is something new it's exciting it takes up very little space in my garage and i'm gonna get a 15 15 pound ball as well for some of the smaller exercises so most of all i'm gonna have fun so after i play around with the slim ball i'm gonna go for a quick walk and i'll meet you back here for lunch time okay so i just came back from my walk went five miles and i'm going to um sip on some electrolytes and make some lunch um it felt so good to move my body to get out there and get moving um and i also wanted to report my i got my mom to do some yoga and i got kyle to come on the walk with me and then he's gonna go for a bike ride next so move your body don't forget that is paid so much into the mental part of the journey so i'll show you the electrolytes that i have i got this really cute um water bottle from my mother-in-law for those that you have a sense of humor i'm sure you'll get a kick out of that um but it also reminds you to drink your freaking water so stay hydrated um so i got new electrolytes from perfecto these ones are daily electrolyte they help um keep your energy up and also keep your um like the any effects from a keto flu um this is pink lemonade and this one is lemon lime i'll give you the quick little description real quick what's in here um i am excited about these lots of good stuff especially the vitamin d and they probably are pretty similar there's the pink lemonade so anyways i put it in here it's delicious if i had to pick a favorite i think i would lean towards the lemon lime but they're both so equally good i'm going to sip on this while i go edit videos after obviously lunch and that will help get me through the day so don't forget about your electrolytes and if you want to purchase these the link will be down below okay so today's breakfast is really easy i get these from costco they're the same brand that makes the canadian bacon um but it has no sugar it has great macros same thing 10 grams of protein um i'll show you the back of the bag real quick clean ingredients um and they're fully cooked so you can either do them on the stove or put them in the microwave so those are the chicken sausage that i recommend we're gonna do half of this avocado i have i'm gonna do a air fryer hard boiled egg but you can do any way to hard boil the eggs you can even buy them from the store already boiled hardy boiled and then lastly i also make my own nuts i will post the recipe down below but basically i take raw uh pecans i put butter on them and stuff pink salt so and then that's how i get i cook them in my oven so check that video out but i want to show you real quick how to measure your nuts i have zeroed out the scale um so i'm looking for either 30 grams or an ounce so i'm gonna have kyle put my roasted pecans we're gonna switch this over to ounces and i'm looking for an ounce so i measure these out and it's very important that you do this step and then plus it makes them portable it makes them easy well there's an ounce so that's what an ounce or a serving size of roasted pecans roasted and salted pecans so that is done next we're going to um take the egg out of the shell and slice the avocado well we're going to pop these in the microwave today all right here's the finished product chicken sausage hard boiled eggs avocado and roasted pecans and i didn't take a picture of my protein shake but it was unsweetened almond milk in a scoop of perfect keto protein um next let's go make dinner this dinner is going to be a real easy dinner we're going to do hamburgers and steamed broccoli so in that package of ground beef i have uh 1 3 pounds of meat um you can use turkey burgers you can use chicken you can use any variety but i'm just you going with straight beef today and we're going to season it up pretty real easy and i'm going to aim for about six burger patties out of this one in a third pound worth of meat and it's i believe this is 85 15 fat to protein ratio so i'm gonna season it with pink salt i for this many burgers i'll roughly do about a half teaspoon of pink salt and then some pepper and the next thing we're going to do is season it up with some onion powder you can season up your burgers however you want them but this is what i do so again i like to do a sprinkling of probably a solid uh quarter two half teaspoon of onion powder and then we're gonna mix it all up so there's the six burger patties and next we're gonna take this bag of frozen broccoli that we've used all week now and if you're wondering what size or what a ballpark figure to go for for a serving size um turn it on the back and work it into your macros how much can you have figure out what you know how you know how much you can have if you can have two cups one cup and see what it does to your macros so we're just gonna steam this up we could steam it up in our in the bag that it came with but i like to steam it on the stove top so right now i'm aiming for about nine servings of broccoli um because i'm feeding six people and um so i'm just aiming for that target total weight so i weigh everything while it's frozen and um then i'm just going to pop that on a the over the stove and steam it um it's so easy so meanwhile we're going to cook up those burgers and then we're going to once the broccoli is all steamed up we're going to do a hunk of butter it was about three tablespoons of butter salt and pepper put the broccoli back in there stir it all up and let's plate our easy dinner tonight we're gonna do just mustard and dill pickles and about six ounces of steamed broccoli so that is today it's delicious and i will see you tomorrow at day two let's do macros okay it's a new day and it's time to track our macros so we started the day off um with my first meal being lunch um we're gonna hit add foods and we had three hard-boiled eggs so there's three already in there because that's what i have all the time we're gonna do um we have real an ounce of nuts and then we also have a haas avocado so you're just going to search in house oops i can't type anything here haas avocado and we had half of an avocado so we're gonna just put there so we change that to a half we have it in an avocado we hit add to today and i also had a protein shake so we have unsweetened almond milk alrighty so we have almond unsweetened original but yep so we had 10 ounces and i did perfect keto today so we have perfect keto vanilla whey protein i just left it plain today perfect keto vanilla protein one scoop good to go so that completed lunch now let's go to dinner we're gonna add our hamburger patty so i have kirkland ground beef and i'm going to enter in raw i have third pound patties so we're just gonna change that to the right and these are tiny that's a half so this must be the third and then add till today and then we also had steamed broccoli so i'm just going to enter in raw broccoli all right there we go broccoli raw six ounces add we also had butter salted butter a tablespoon of butter i had dill pickles there we go we have dill pickles one serving i don't log mustard i do need to log my keto coffee so i have that as a saved recipe because i have it all the time there it is add and there we have it easy as that so now we've have 11 of 19 net carbs 103 grams of fat 98 grams of protein and 13 23 calories so another solid day we'll see you tomorrow at day six you're watching keto rewind you", "ARaF-wiNwq4": "[Music] hi i'm tim wayne general manager at jerry the galleria jewelry in the woodlands texas and i'm very pleased to be talking to you guys today about one of my favorite collections that we've ever carried and that is blueberry sapphires by le'veon whether it's predicting the next fashion trends for the red carpet or showcasing some of the most beautiful fancy color diamond and gemstones that nature's ever created it sounds hard to see why jewelry connoisseurs from around the world have a very special place in their hearts and in their collections for some of these amazing designs done by levion so probably one of the most common questions we get is why are they called blueberry sapphires and the answer's actually insanely easy they look like blueberries and so for le'veon you'll notice a lot of times they use that food descriptor to really paint a picture in your mind of exactly what color and quality you're looking at and it really makes sense and for something like sapphires it really really makes sense because sapphires are all chromatic they come in every color of the rainbow and if you get a blue it could be a really dark blue almost like a black or a very pale blue but when you hear blueberry your mind immediately paints that picture and you know exactly what to expect and for le'veon that's just one of the details that they look at they look at so many different factors including not only the color but the quality the cut of the stone the origins even the sourcing of the gemstone so when you see that levion stamp on it you know that you're getting incredible quality and so for many of you guys i'm sure you're already collectors and you've probably already heard the acronym love used to describe this company and what a great acronym to use for them because it really speaks to the heart of who le'veon is the l stands for legend and the legend behind this family is amazing they've had 500 years in the jewelry industry they're still family owned and operated and now they're based out of new york city so as far as originality for the o that's where le'veon is really in a category all of their own when it comes to originality many of their pieces are built around one specific diamond or gemstone that only accompanies amnesia's levion could find and as far as the other originalities behind it there's over half a million different sketches that they go through each year to create their amazing designs and many of them are limited to less than two dozen in the entire world pretty amazing as far as the value goes that's where levion's family relationships really go into play they go down to the mind level and work directly with them to get the best value it's the le'veon family's dream that every family be able to afford a levy on piece and to do that that takes a real commitment to value into sourcing now as far as the everlasting goes that's where every one of their pieces comes with a lifetime gemstone diamond and metalwork guarantee that's pretty amazing so as you guys can see you're getting an amazing value with le'veon and love really speaks to the heart of that so enough words about how amazing these blueberry sapphires are let's take a look at some of my favorite pieces directly off jared.com [Music] [Music] you", "YVPQC-eMrFk": "[Music] do okay you guys we just came back from sprouts and i have a couple of things in my mind that i'm thinking about making and i hope it doesn't turn into an epic fail because i i wanna make well we're showing it either way okay i wanna make funnel cakes keto funnel cakes you guys so keto cake funnel cakes from the fair that you used to get well i bought avocado oil because they're fried i think i'm gonna make a keto chao protein based truffle to make it with and i bought some new for chatel i don't know how to pronounce this you guys nufa chatel chatel uh cheese to use is the cream cheese cheese base and i'm gonna make a raspberry compote to go on top of it because the funnel cakes that harry and i grew up with were from knott's berry farm and a long time ago nuts very far made them and used real boysenberry compote oh yeah and sprinkled powdered sugar on the top of them and we were right across from the log right that was the only funnel uh cake booth and the line was like around the building it was so big but i want to do that uh raspberries are one of the few um berries that you can have you can have strawberries blackberries raspberries and blueberries in moderation so i'm gonna do that you guys in my mind i'm thinking what i need to do it may be an epic fail it may be may not work but in my mind i think i know what i'm going to do so i'll bring you guys back but we went to sprouts so i got organic raspberries i got the new fatshell fat new for chateau anyway it's one third less fat than regular cream cheese and there's one less carb too i got the super creamer i see everybody using it and this one does not have almond milk in it and i've been having issues you guys remember i quit doing almond milk because it was killing my hands my hands are doing great so i want to try this one this one's the vanilla the reason why i decided to do this is you guys because i drink heavy whipping cream there isn't any this was the largest and there was only one this is the only one on the planet so it's crazy harry i know they had all the sizes of half and half and this lone little heavy whipping cream sitting on the shelf all by itself so that's what i got that's what i got now in my mind i also have a recipe that i want to do with the uh tomato cream tomato basil savory soup base from ketochow and i wanted to have sausage in it and i wanted to have mozzarella cheese in it i need to get mozzarella cheese um so i'm thinking about that sometime this week but this is really good really clean ingredients true story is awesome and i don't know harry did we get the ingredients or not i can't remember i was torn between this and applegate they're both really good brands but i just think i'm going to try this brand and see now i also you guys are posting stuff on the loving knit on keto with wendy found facebook group and the pictures look yummy and if you guys are new and you haven't joined yet please join our facebook group because i'm telling you the food that people are posting is absolutely amazing delicious and keto uh i've been seeing i saw pizza truffles that looked amazing so i got some rouse homemade pizza sauce and this is the these are the ingredients can you get see them down here okay you guys the ingredients for the rows homemade pizza sauce is italian whole peeled tomatoes italian cherry tomatoes olive oil carrots onions salt oregano garlic and basil that's it super simple super easy you get a whole quarter of a cup for 40 calories and three total carbohydrates so these are what i'm gonna make during the week you guys so you guys are kind of seeing my meal prepping items that i'm gonna need and look you guys we got the only two ginger root beer and we got a black cherry zvm you got to grab it when they have it i'm telling you stuff's not on the shelves like it used to be so anyway you guys this is my little haul and i'm really excited because i'm going to make those um funnel cakes but you guys harry's got to fix the camera because there he's having issues with the the focus i'll let him do that we'll come back on the next segment we'll share the big board with everybody okay everybody this is an experiment i hope that it works i am making keto funnel cakes wendy's way and i'm topping them with a warm raspberry compote so i have two ounces of strawberries i mean if raspberries two ounces weighted raspberries and i'm just going to smash them up just a little bit smash these babies up you can use your berry of choice as long as it's keto strawberry raspberry blueberry they don't have boysenberries here but you guys may be able to if you guys live in a state that has them what about the uh sugar content to this stuff it doesn't the keto berries these are potato berries huh yes they're they're they're born without sugar they are the lee strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries are the lowest in sugar and they are keto but you have to weigh and measure them and you have to fit them into your macros got it so i am using two ounces and quit asking questions or my brain isn't going to work here you just have to just be quiet unless you hear me say pounds and it's supposed to be ounces so i'm taking smashed two ounces smashed fresh raspberries i'm putting them in a pan and this pan is actually too big i want a little pan i have a littler one because you're not making that much because you're not pouring this on this is just a drizzle of raspberry compote okay so taking my raspberry putting it in putting it in and i i make everything simple you guys i make it really simple so here's the deal smash it up get that raspberry taste now i have strawberry syrup from walden's farms it's already made already done so i am making i'm taking a third of a cup taking the strawberry walden farms you can order it on amazon you can get it in the stores it is made with sucralose putting that in the container now let me stir this up i'm a taster this is for harry and i so i lick things and taste things and do things ooh that's going to look really good okay now i'm going to turn this oven on get it heated it smells like candy huh other than that it smells good yeah i may or may not put a little bit of lemon in this sometimes you need that extra kick let me get a little spoon well what's it need which is pretty damn good does it i just want i like the tart and tanginess so i'm just gonna take this homemade not homemade homegrown lemon and i'm just gonna literally put a couple drops barely squeeze 10 11 11 drops just to give some sis get that citrusy taste to it on the taste yep butter taste now it has it it'll it'll be more flavorful wow not good that tastes a lot better than i thought it would okay so i want to let that be going now looking at recipes you need hot oil i'm using avocado oil because you can heat it to 500 degrees turning my oven on and you're supposed to put an inch of oil in here that's a lot of oil but we are frying the funnel cake we're frying it in olive oil no an avocado oil avocado oil big difference big difference okay so i'm gonna get that hot interestingly enough if you have a wooden handle or a wooden spoon you heat your avocado oil you put your spoon in it when it gets bubbles around the wood that's hot enough yes really yes that's an old old cook trick before they had all this newfangled appliances like uh you know auto temperature gauges and all the good things in life okay so this is going look see i'm gonna cook it down i just want to cook it down cook it down turn it down to medium so you wait for it to steam then turn it down to medium no i waited for it to boil and get hot see it's bubbling i want the natural sugars to thicken up and reduce down a little bit that's what i want and if you guys have one of those newfangled little things that you can de-seed and you don't like raspberry seeds you can de-seed it and put it in it's just basically getting a taste i want that taste yep i put that on low like about two and just let that heat okay here's the deal i have two ounces and this is going to go fast harry don't ask questions because my brain has to make the recipe i've got two ounces of this i don't interrupt ever yeah i have two ounces of this cheese you can use cream cheese or this this is a little less tart a little bit more smooth because you want the batter to be really smooth i've got three eggs in here okay i am gonna add half of a teaspoon vanilla extract i am adding in a quarter of a cup of heavy cream i'm going to put in half a cup of water right now and i'm just going to put it in here because i want to get that cream out of my cup right so this is a quarter of a cup and then another quarter of a cup that equals a half a cup right now okay whip it now in here i have a pinch of salt redmond salt i have a three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder i have a tablespoon of squirt of swerve confectioner's sugar in here a tablespoon okay so i'm gonna get that all in here i'm gonna make sure we've got it all i'm gonna mix that give it a good swirl here now excuse your head let me check on this real quick that's good get the cheese out and into the batter into here i want to mix it really good sorry you guys i don't have a good counter to share this on everything with but i just don't watch out harry that's very hot okay now paper bird flying through the room here's the deal i'm using keto chow yes i am because i don't have flour i don't have regular flour i'm not using almond flour because i don't do well with almonds so i'm using ketochow vanilla and i'm using one packet or if you don't have the packet you have the big container one scoop putting it in i want them to use keto chow this is the recipe sorry folks i don't know in my head what the difference would be between the two all i know is this in my head works so we'll see now gotta use the immersion blender so i'm one okay one's low yep okay that's what i want take that off harry i'm going to give you this put it away now taste test it oh wow oh my god vanilla cake really they can just spoon with the batter on a cake oh yeah yes indeed now anyone has that uh excuse me i gotta get this prettiness of what harry can make make cakes you know i'm gonna put this in here see oh look at that that means the oil is hot enough i know pretty cool huh yeah okay now i know why you like now i know why you got some wooden things i was always wondering all this out of the way because this is going to be oh please dear god let it work okay you guys got my scoop here we go here we go you want to pour it in in little circles we're dipping everywhere [Music] i think it's gonna burn move out of the way i have the fire way too hot way too hot okay smells good it may not work i think i got the fire way too hot first batch [Music] yeah it's way too hot i think so yeah smell it smells like burnt pancakes i don't smell anything yet let's try this again shall we it may be the batter doesn't work that didn't work the batter may not work let me see the batter may not work because you need flour to hold it together may not work you guys just may not work i really wanted it to work [Music] that's i don't know if it's the keto chow or what we'll see we'll see might be lots of things might be the cheese i may not i may not have to put any cheese in here i don't know it's all bubbling up like crazy i'm going to make some looks good though it does kind of bubbling yeah it doesn't look good though they're going that rough i'm going to have to figure it out am i i think it's the cheese maybe keto chao without the cheese in it smells good doesn't need herring and it did taste like cake batter yeah there we go what do you got the setting on from low it's a problem with electric you have to yeah but i wouldn't notify i'd be afraid to just run a flame water and oil don't mix you need a bag of sand on the sideline is that what you're saying yeah and i wouldn't try doing this unless you knew how to fry you know actually it smells good because of all the uh i think what it is is this has too much cheese in it okay let me try this try this well now it's not hot enough flame on it might be the keto towel you taste this i don't know oh that kind of roast yeah it goes to the inside coming up as it's getting hotter that's really good flavor there's like three a charm then you take a little bit of swerve sprinkle it and get some of this andros light with a little raspberry like you said harry can't be perfect all the time that's right it's impossible i'll try this that's pretty dang good i gotta perfect the the batter something wrong with the batter it's making i think it's the cheese try this it's good looks terrible yeah i know but man it's really good though all right okay i'm on fire actually that's very good it is it's really but it's just looks funky it's not it's not more than it looks like funnel cake it's softer than funnel cake and i think it needs no cheese i think i need to make it without the cheese and make another batch and try it okay i have the oil you know well you can use that wow i don't know i do like it see these pieces look like funnel cake these little guys that looks like funnel cake fried funnel cake goodness this is gonna be more eggy maybe i have too many eggs i'll figure it out telling you because that's good which very good oh my god it's really good this one is more burnt yeah but let's how many have it taste it though it's good you have a bite tastes better yeah it tastes burnt so what i mean have another piece why isn't this one going yeah it's got a burnt taste to it this is not hot enough look it's too cheesy too too eggy too cheesy so what i'm going to do i'm going to make another batch because it's worth experimenting on it's worth figuring out i'm going to come back and i'm going to make a different batch of this for everyone because i think i think if i don't put any i'll come right back you guys round two let's check it out these make little puffs so i made another batch these i think have too much baking powder in them and i took i'm not using the cheese in them at all let's put them aside now this is round two you got the stuff hot enough and all that stuff i hope so let me taste this let's see what this does this has no cream no cheese in it and it has one egg let's see what we can do nope it's got to be thinner got to put a little bit more water in it too thick too thick so how much water you got in it so far i'm gonna put an eighth of a cup i have a half a cup in it says to drizzle it you gotta have well there's got to be something runny it has to be somewhat rough yummy so three quarters of a cup do that's more funnel cakey looking i used one egg three quarters cup of water half a teaspoon of baking soda or baking powder a tablespoon of swerve a package of eggnog ketochow and it is doing better you just want to puff like little balloons and let's taste this one harry please look at these little balloony puffy guys right because they look pretty that's pretty good actually so let me these are the first batch first try this is the one that had the cheese and the um three eggs in it sprinkle a little bit these have a more donut-y taste to them okay let me taste see mmm those are good have one oops pull that off for me i got mmm that's my favorite fruit mm-hmm yeah i smell like fear more funnel cakey not bad mine okay danger danger will robinson yeah the fat movie absolutely now that's good that's really good um let's put a little raspberry on that [Music] these need to go up just a little bit they want to puff up like a little pancake like a little balloon which is fine they taste good they just don't funnel they don't funnel you know i don't know what that means well the fun they don't stick together and i think that's because there's no flour but they really have a good taste yeah they're great that raspberry compote is delicious here harry funnel cakes wendy's way these are really good these ones are aren't they oh yeah even though they want to puff like a balloon mm-hmm chase top oh yeah that's the ticket you just have to be patient i'm gonna try one now those are like really good yeah here's some with raspberry i got some it tastes like doughnuts yeah yeah i taste doughnutty kinda you think five pounds tomorrow i don't know i'm telling you that's good those aren't good all day long i have the big oops look what i did is that one yours harry is that what you're saying no you can have it if you want it no you cooked it if you're not gonna eat it it's mine these are dangerous those are i know they are you guys they may not look like funnel cakes as far as sticking together but oh my gosh they are addicting because i got them everywhere okay i need another i have to stop or i'll eat the whole plate this one's the eggnog you mean eggnog well i made it with one egg oh okay no cheese right i made it with a quarter of a cup of heavy cream i made it with that sucker look at that bad boy right there it's like a donut look at that big thing i know it's like a donut what you made at all the play's almost empty how'd that happen okay here we go see if i can do it problem is it's getting it thin enough i may have to put it like in a little thing where you just you know what would work really good doing that what that oil separator we have not oh to pour it because it holds in the bottom and you just kind of fill it up push this push the little trigger and let it come out the bottom now this is looks more like a funnel cake this one's the eggnog with a quarter of a cup of cream the um half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a tablespoon of swerve half of a teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt yeah that looks good now where's my little spoon i wonder how many people are not familiar with funnel cakes well they can google it because if you've never been to a fair you probably don't know what a bottle cake is it's basically fried dough sprinkled in powdered sugar and served hot like these are or they have a compote of some kind of fruit warm fruit compote on them again just a little bit a raspberry goes a long ways on these then they taste like raspberry filled donuts yes they do they do i'm telling you now this one harry you ate all yours no i did it the dog did that you forgot those i have to have those little guys to have those this is the biggest mass but it's so good gotta eat them hot look at this it's like a little pillow donut eggnog does it taste like eggnog i have those that's really good which ones well you get the little ones because you ate all the other ones yes eggnoggy oh huh ma'am and they used to put it on a paper plate and you just have to eat it with your fingers which one do you like better well i couldn't tell you yeah why because i'm inhaling it yeah i get i'll take this one right here i'll take don't take this little one right here okay seriously i like them both but i think i like the vanilla this over here better use the vanilla one but again i got a really good bite of something that must be the eggnog stuff well i'll tell you what i got powder everywhere that's good i wouldn't say no to any of these no i'll have to write this up oh yeah because there's a trick to it and i think it does not need any cheese that's one of the tricks but look at my front i think i'm wearing it not that bad excuse me honey it's not gonna work mine it's too hot so the trick is to get your temperature of the oil correct number one number two don't get it all over you wear your apron yeah like the hair yeah i like the apple in your box thank you i should have had it on because now i'm covered with swerve powdered swerve but oh my gosh you guys these are good i just got to get the consistency right you know there's some of you guys that are really good chefs okay so i'm going to start naming some people shelly karen come on you guys help a girl out here yeah really man let's see if this kind of make this a uh open source kind of thing going on because let me tell you the vanilla one all day long has fabulous flavor i don't have any more keto vanilla well really now i'm going to have to get some people don't need to eat anymore these are just like donuts oh my god i'm going to see if i can flip it like a real funnel cake he's ready i don't know yeah you know maybe karen or shelly's got a foot i know look at that there that's better that's better there we i think you don't need the cheese in it i don't think you need um you gotta get the oil just right and you don't need as much um baking baking powder the first one had three quarters of a teaspoon this one has a quarter of a teaspoon because i am using keto chop this one looks like it's going to be the best so this one would be a quarter of a cup of cream one egg three quarters a cup of water half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a tablespoon of swerve confectioner's sugar pinch of salt that looks good doesn't it oh yeah that's the one [Music] that looks really good i gotta write this down because seriously that is a keeper it really is it's just difficult you gotta you gotta just really pour it in slow you gotta get the batter the right consistency so it pours because otherwise it looks like doughnuts which they're good but you gotta let them cook longer and um it's really good move move puppy baby she's like right under her foot because she says i want someone the funnel cake that's what i like i like to know they came up with the name funnel well they may have poured it from a funnel originally you know like a batter funnel and squeezed it in and made it look all pretty yeah decorated yeah swirled it around right and that probably would work really well with this but i didn't have any funnel paper or plastic i could have used a baggie and squeezed it but once you start squeezing you got to use it all [Music] it's just softer than a funnel cake batter because there's no flour excuse me it's really interesting you know how they make fun of cakes and then just crisscross over the funnel and i just make sure you have no babies or puppies around them yeah and stuff and don't have don't use water around it because it's oil have an inch of oil here throw water in that you're going to have a freaking explosion i mean you don't even want your utensils to have water on them yup because you are cooking with a lot of oil now i'm going to put a little cinnamon on this one a little cinnamon a little sugar a little swerve a little bit of cinnamon you know wendy's way yeah teaspoon compote on it it's funny it doesn't take a lot of raspberry at all you ever notice that yeah bring that flavor over oh this one's doing over here okay taste this one harry that's hot well don't burn yourself well try not to it's puffy like a donut it's very good isn't it it's good how's that uh going to the fair kind of taste to it it does i like it better without the cinnamon i think because it's moist real funnel cake taste yeah this is dinner man look at it five pounds we'll know why you can't stop eating it that's the problem that's good [Music] here if you had one of those really big fat spatulas oh yeah that'd be good they make them i may go get one because i'm telling you this is worth it if you're craving donuts if you're craving fair food all day long oh my gosh well i don't want to set anybody off with this no but they're very filling really watch harry wendy gained 25 pounds right before your eyes it sounds like it would huh mine i dip it in that powdered sugar yeah the first one you guys i burnt because the the oil was too hot the first batter puff puffed up too much and i think it was softer it was the cheese so i really think this last batch is the best excuse me it reminds me being a little kid like a little kid eating that crud stuff this isn't crud it's good so i really like the vanilla the best yeah yeah that's really good me too that one that i had over here yeah with the vanilla yeah this was that was good that was good so what did you use in that one vanilla just that's all you change is just the one item i took out the cream cheese because it's too wet it was too thick and too dense and i used less eggs okay yeah you're gonna have to write this down because it's very complicated because we did so many different things yes what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna make it from scratch the way i think i did it the last very last time and do it in a plain environment before i give you the thumbs up on what the recipe is but i'm sure it's one egg quarter of a cup of heavy whipping cream or your milk substitute you're going to need more or less water depending on your milk substitute because you want it thick i used a pinch of salt quarter of a teaspoon of baking powder a tablespoon of swerve confectioners sugar and i used a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and if you're missing donuts homemade fried donuts this is for you telling you just remember if you're making if you make this yes i sure record everything else you ate that day so you'll know very sorry if this is what makes you go up or the other food you eat makes you look because we aren't going to know nothing until tomorrow morning well what i should have done in hindsight what i should have done is measured my oil first cooled it all the way off and then re-measured it to see how much oil soaked in to the actual batter and if you eat this the day you eat it don't use oil on anything else yeah and don't eat all the batches like carrie and i are well we gotta try them out totally that good it is good it is good if you have your vanilla ketochow that is absolutely the one i would use oh my god every day of the week i'm gonna have to do something to try to control this okay if i was to eat dinner too oh my goodness excuse me you guys funnel cake keto style it doesn't look pretty but let me tell you it's pretty dang tasty it really is but i've got to perfect this first you guys get to look at it you get to see it and if you're brave maybe you can recreate it but don't use cheese in it don't use as many eggs i used one egg to one packet of keto chow quarter of a cup of cream i think a whole cup or half or three quarters of a cup of water you want it thick the batter thick a little thick you want to make sure it's really a pinch of salt half a teaspoon of vanilla a tablespoon of swerve and it's really good that is good that is good that is funnel cake look at that funnel cake at its finest i can't quite eat anything [Music] up so that's addictive it's bad this is bad it's bad so good oh my god i hope nobody sees us doing this i don't mind it's clear that's greasy oh man everything in a doughnut did you the grave the sugar the vanilla the jam should have made more raspberry stuff yeah i didn't know i'd be making two batches three you made three two three one vanilla one eggnog it just seems like a lot well it's not how many these made i said batches i'll take that you're gonna make it no i want to have a bite i'll share here yes you no you have it [Music] shall we get some why don't you give her that it's too greasy i'm worried about the grease", "kOn-7zOKjWk": "i am said you needed a break and left with no heads up i was strong for

to do like an intentional amazon delivery once a week or once a month once a month maybe once a week i mean don't judge but i wanted to share two things that i got today that i'm super excited about and i wanted to recommend to you guys because i've been loving them and i'll share the links down below for you guys too if you want to check them out first thing is this coffee is so good you guys so good it's um i got it on amazon and all four of the flavors are amazing i know it's not winter but this is so good and i wanted to share it with you and so i buy it and put it in my drawers over here and that's the coffee i've been loving and the next thing that i've been loving that i wanted to share with you are these slippers we um we have tile and uh whatever that is wood hardwood i don't know if it's real wood but anyway it's hard on my feet and so i needed some good slippers that were cute and comfy so i bought these they were jessica simpson brand but they were super affordable and so comfy and warm i love them it gets so cold in our house so i wanted to recommend those to you guys because if something's good i want to recommend it to you guys so our cookies are almost done um a lot of you asked me about our dishwasher you're like how does that even happen one of those things and it was not the previous owner's fault like we destroyed the dishwasher it was not their fault a lot of you guys are like oh that sucks you just got a new house in your dishwasher it was not their fault it was ours 100 i took it apart and washed it my husband put it back together wrong and then we ran it in a sanitized cycle and then we broke the arm melted it and i don't even think if we buy another arm it'll work because the heating element is damaged so i'm just using it as a drying rack now and i had ordered another dishwasher but it doesn't come until august 20th so here's to another month of hand washing we'll live we'll pretend like we're pioneers okay so oh it's done was that not perfect timing or what holy cow guys these smell amazing so so good come to mama oh yes those smell amazing so i'm gonna put this next batch in i'm trying not to let the camera fog up but um i did i didn't have it enough last time and i did 10 minutes so i'm doing 12 but so i always start with 10 if i don't know the oven and then see so my other ovens i knew like oh yeah those are you know 10 minutes but this one i'm still trying to figure out and it's electric and our rental had gas and i used to be a i used to really really love electric and then i went to gas and people said once you go gas you'll never go back and they would be correct because i really really miss my gas stove it cooked things so fast but this stove is super nice and beautiful in fact i love it and i am not replacing it because it's amazing so um unfortunately my dishwasher has to get replaced but it actually was pretty darn good too and i intended on putting it on project free and giving it away but now um it's just dead and that's sad so lesson learned put your dishwasher back together correctly um and my husband feels really bad too so that these need to set for a little while they're just squishy but they smell amazing you guys so i'm gonna wrap this one up and get this up for you guys with our sprouts haul tell me what you love to get from sprouts tell me if you've cooked with monk fruit what are your favorite things to cook with that and um don't forget to give a thumbs up and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one bye hey guys i just wanted to do a little haul for sprouts i hadn't been there since we've lived here in oklahoma but i actually really loved it i am convinced this is the only way to buy sour cream now in the pouch because it lasts longer and i just like it better i have been dying to try the tillamook ice cream and grabbed one i think my husband will like this my kids and i like this we love chips and salsa it's a guilty pleasure and i think we're gonna do that tonight and then we have some meat and cheese to use up so i found this bread for a buck 99 i thought we'll just make little sandwiches and then we have been eating some fruit so i got some little mangoes yellow mangoes and regular mangoes blueberries my girls love blueberries these grapes looked awesome and some yellow peaches so just some yummy fresh stuff i had stocked up on aldi with some pantry items but wanted to get some fresh stuff at sprouts and then i got some goodies at hobby lobby you guys know i'm obsessed with fall right now i actually bought this in orange and i'm gonna put

subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one bye [Music] said you needed a break", "ZA1nDfK9DRM": "[Music] and today we got some great diamonds from cure leaf and a cure leaf grape diamonds live resin cart I was gonna do a little bit of comparing and kind of explain a little bit behind the process of these live resin carts and it's quite a few people or I guess you could say a little bit confused so these carts are gonna be a little different than the live resin cars that you get from like Cali or Colorado it's not gonna have the crystallization or the diamonds you want to stay inside of it because it is distillate guys so this is distillate with the live resin turps reintroduced later on super tasty though and it is really good so it's not gonna be like taking an actual dab how the other tarts would be with the actual diamonds inside of it and stuff it's gonna be like smoking a regular car SuperDuper flavorful with more Terps in it and you should have some more medicinal values of it too whenever they reintroduce those terms so anyways let's jump into this grape diamond to flower real quick I wanted to take a good smell it is Oh oh my gosh guys so guys the smell of these is so similar that's why I know that they are actually using a live resin and bringing the Terps over guys this right here it literally smells the exact same as this taste however that makes sense because the vapor I can't smell it as much as I can like smell an actual flower but the taste is like what I smell right here it's crazy all right guys let's crack one of these buds open and smoke a bowl of this grape diamonds from cure leaf this shit's fire though I don't mind it a lot of people were hating on it but I'm loving it it's got some super good flavor very very tasty definitely grape notes um it had a little bit of peppery and earthy flavors in it it's not bad though really good stuff oh when you break it up it just pretend they're so how's everybody doing with that coronavirus going on y'all smoking on y'all keeping busy during this craziness me and Miss J we were watching some crazy [ __ ] earlier this girl took a steak knife and cut her hair off y'all I think this quarantine is literally driving people crazy [ __ ] I think I'm getting through it um well there's some here on there got some crazy quarantine stories let me know what's up in the comments oh here we go here we go without further ado guys this is great diamonds coming into 22.2% let's get this hemp wig yeah and [Music] [Music] and we're on to Bowl number two guys haha and we are lit bowl number two guys cheers yeah guys yeah definitely peppery super grapey though like a little sweet skunky to it it's really really good though [Music] even even a more like smoked Bowl tastes good super flavorful guys so I got two different batteries guys that we're gonna use for our cart I've got one of the ones from fluid this does three different settings not bad for the price this one right here though I have bolts exchanged and kind of tricked it out a little bit you know yeah I got my Star Wars and my panda bear just adidas alright yeah let's throw this bad boy inside of this one first matter of fact let's throw this bad boy inside of the blue in rumors so I'm gonna take this one green guys it's gonna be a little bit lower temperature that way I can taste it a little better here we go guys cheers this is grape diamonds live resin carp your leave [Music] very tasty it's so crazy how similar the taste is but then again when you think about it if they reintroduce the turbulence to it it's not that crazy it's very very good though guys this cart right here is where it said it's very very tasty [Music] it's literally like taking a small roof of there's great diamonds right here it's kind of tripping me out a little bit it's really good though these are this is the first live resin cart that I've tried so I know we got a lot of controversy going on about these carts guys are they live resident are they not and so many people are going back and forth so it is this sort of guys it's not an actual like I said earlier a DAB in a cart it's gonna be dis lit with the Turks from the live resin reintroduced to it I'll go for a third one guys I'm over here spacing out here we go Cheers super-good I'm gonna try it on the other better see if it tastes any different [Music] I'm over here spinning the big-ass battery instead of spamming cart whoo yeah and we're on guys Cheers a lot more gravy wow that is so much more great B than using that better that's weird maybe the airflow is better that's why I don't know very good though and I don't even smoke cards guys this is actually really good so you are gonna be able to get these in quite a few different strains guys just go check them out it's the live resin carts on their website they don't have them in stock all the time but they got quite a few different strains I saw it in taffy the other day like I said the great diamonds it's gonna vary in price by the percentage of it though so that's the only kind of messed-up thing they should just have a stuck price for them instead of like going up and down just because this one's a little more potent you know I mean it's just it's kind of just nitpicking right now but hopefully those things will change a little bit in the future if you guys haven't check us out on the wheat tube check us out at Lake that's La yke and if you haven't check us out on Instagram check us out at underscore tree show appreciate you watching guys shout outs to all the new and old subscribers thanks for smoking with me see in the next one [Music]", "n59s2lYeA8w": "plant-based eating um you know um lots of things have changed in that direction i hear people say i have my meat and potatoes i couldn't do that i want to be on a keto diet but um zoya dr ganguly and stuart are really going to share some some thoughts about um what would it you know what is it to be a a plant eater people are get concerned that you know i'm not going to protein or iron i'm going to have bone fractures i'll never survive but the reality is plant-based eating has three benefits it's good for your health it's good for the planet it's good for the animals and a number of years ago i became predominantly a plant eater i'm not a vet i'm not a true vegetarian i still eat fish i still have some dairy i still have some eggs but i'm moving in that direction so i'm really excited that zoya and the team has put together a really nice presentation so zoey i want you to take it from here and thank you so much perfect thank you dr kearney so hi everyone my name is loya and i'm a student at the clinic i myself have been trying to be a plant-based eater so this topic was really exciting for me and i hope you all enjoy the information we have for you today anybody wants to have dinner i'm having a nice big salad and my number one beverage is water today um and the maple leafs are doing well too as well so more can you ask okay so we'll just get into our agenda then so this is a brief agenda of what we're going to cover today in today's webinar we have a check-in at the beginning so i'll just kind of gauge how everyone is doing with their health goals we will talk about what is plant-based eating how to get started and then look at the health benefits and the environmental benefits as well okay so this is my little progress check-in here feel free to grab a pen and paper and write down your answers to these as well it's really important to be able to track your progress and if you want you can also write it in our chat so what is your health goal for this month what have you been doing well so far to achieve that goal what do you want to improve and what changes do you want to make in the next 30 days being as specific as possible as you can with these health goals is key and not being afraid to try new things as well okay so we have an exciting guest speaker here today dr ganguly a plant-based advocate and a gastroenterologist as well so he is going to give a small presentation about plant-based eating before we get into our other information it's interesting i met dr gang guli uh initially in the clinic to look at his lipids and uh he was one of those guys that didn't want to be on as few medications is possible and uh you showed us some really some remarkable progress so thank you for uh um coming on and uh he has a wonderful website he's gonna tell you about a wonderful program and uh a great colleague so thank you for coming out tonight my pleasure greg yeah i know it was uh it was lovely to get to meet you as well and uh it's lovely to meet someone who had similar interests and was interested in health uh so yeah we could flip to my first slide um uh perfect okay so let's go just back one slide then okay perfect okay click back to my just the introduction then um so let me tell you what kind of got me to where i where i was at the starting point so about seven years ago i found i was very very tired i was just running out of energy didn't seem to have the usual zip get up and go so i went and harassed my excellent family doctor asked them to do a whole bunch of different blood work try and figure out why i just didn't seem to have the same energy and zip that i used to have and among all of the blood tests is what comes up on the next screen next slide so here is is uh the kind of basic data that came back from at least some of the tests with my family doctor so uh my weight at that time was 161 uh pounds i'm only about five feet five and a half inches you never forget the half inch of course um so my bmi would have probably been about 27 back then uh and a1c it's a blood test that basically averages your blood sugar over the previous six to eight weeks which is actually very interesting you know most blood tests are are at a specific point in time but just because of the way that the glycosylated hemoglobin works is it basically averages your your blood sugar for the previous eight weeks or so so normal is six percent or less if it's six point five percent or above you're considered diabetic and mine came back in the middle 6.3 so that's called uh pre-diabetes and um so uh that that meant that i was pre-diabetic and i've also put the left-hand column under normal that just means what the normal values are and then the right hand column with the title september 2011 that's my blood work at that time so my up other lipids were except for my hdl i guess being a little bit low my other lipids looked basically fine the bottom thing the c-reactive protein that's a marker of inflammation that i think most people consider among other things to be a reasonable uh generic marker of cardiac risk because inflammation and blood clots can go together and that was actually normal so uh with me being uh pre-diabetic i must admit that that got me uh very nervous um and just to kind of give you some context of where i was at next slide uh this next slide basically shows you what my diet and my lifestyle was at that point so i would have bran flakes granola and milk for breakfast i would have a uh sandwich with whole wheat bread and often some sort of ham or something and some veggies with a diet coke for lunch and then suppers would be homemade it would be things like spaghetti bolognese salad maybe a chicken curry maybe some rice dal is a curried lentil so it would certainly fit me within the canada food guide i think most people would consider that fairly healthy and my level of exercise was was fairly minimal uh at that time so it was almost comical in the sense that i'd been a doctor by that time for oh whatever about 20 some years and it just it just suddenly hit me when i found out that i was pre-diabetic i suddenly realized that although i was actually very comfortable giving prescriptions and medications to patients i didn't really want to take medications myself i far would prefer to prevent myself becoming diabetic and not take medications so my approach to that was to start giving talks on preventing diabetes because i find that's one of the best ways to learn is by trying to teach someone so i i gave talks on preventing diabetes i came across a randomized controlled trial which is generally felt to be the best way to to show that an intervention works in medicine you can you can look at multiple randomized controlled trials and something called a meta-analysis that's even higher but anyway i found a big randomized control trial of 3200 people who were pre-diabetic like me and they were basically hold on for a second here this is this dye is pretty darn good it's a good you know like you know the diet coke and that was it in the um bran flakes are good you're not eating too much body mass index at 27 um that's you know it's that's um better than most people i see um how old was the time uh about 48 i would guess yeah yeah and is was there diabetes in your family well that was the other thing that i learned because my dad had developed type 2 diabetes and i basically kind of learned that it's a bit of a kind of indian curse indians seem to have a a bit of a tendency towards being type 2 diabetic i mean historically it probably had some survival value in the sense that if a period of starvation came people with that gene were less likely to starve to death but i learned that having a relative with type 2 diabetes was a pretty strong risk factor for getting it yourself so this is kind of what gave an extra oomph to my desperation to try and prevent myself getting it anyway so i found this study of 3 200 people who are pre-diabetic and they were randomized to basically do what your doctor tells you versus a very intensive lifestyle intervention basically to get them towards a heart-healthy diet so that was a low-fat diet they were allowed to have meat and dairy and this and that but basically it was what it actually was a i think it was the national cholesterol education program diet and then they were also told to exercise two and a half hours a week they had multiple small groups they basically were coached to do this so in this clinical trial this intervention was a very intense intervention because they had weekly meetings initially and then a couple of meetings a month this will never be reproduced in real life and surprise surprise four years later for every seven people who did this lifestyle intervention they were able to prevent one case of diabetes so that sounded good but interestingly they followed these people for 15 years and 15 years later in the lifestyle group well in the placebo group who just did what their doctor told them 15 years later 60 of them got diabetes type 2 diabetes in the lifestyle group that had this intensive intervention 52 of them still got diabetes now that was a significant difference 52 versus 60 that was an 8 reduction but for me as someone with skin in the game when i looked at it i saw that as saying there was a 52 chance that i had diabetes in 15 years i considered that a 52 failure rate so i was a little discouraged at that point but i kept reading and so that was when things started getting quite interesting because after that i came across a different study so this study actually looked at 99 people who already did have diabetes and they were randomized either to go on the american diabetes association diet which i would have thought was the right diet for them or on a diet that was called whole food plant-based which was a bit new to me now the other thing about this study it had 99 people which was a reasonable size not huge but reasonable and they followed them for 74 weeks so 74 weeks is a year and a half that is a good length of time and they use this hba1c which kind of averages the blood sugar for the last six to eight weeks next slide so i'm going to show you what the results of that study were so here we go so on the vertical axis that's the number for the hba1c if you remember i told you that 6.5 was the diagnosis of diabetes so you can see that both groups both lines start at roughly eight percent then you can see that the horizontal axis is the time in weeks 11 weeks 22 weeks all the way out to 74 weeks so what you can see is that the a1c goes down in both groups but around 11 or 12 weeks so after about three months it pretty clearly separates and what you can see is that the the black line the vegan group which is the plant-based group is consistently lower from 11 weeks to 22 weeks and it stays lower all the way out to 74 weeks so here you can see that the plant-based group did significantly better than the american diabetes association died which a i found very interesting because it was clearly better b i found kind of confusing because i found myself saying well if there's a better diet why doesn't the american diabetes association recommend the better diet and they so this was actually a a piece of new information for me now i liked meat i didn't really think i could give up meat but i kept reading and reading and so i started coming across more and more studies that use diet and lifestyle next slide so here's a study that i came across that looked at a lifestyle intervention and heart disease now admittedly well it was a randomized study but admittedly it was small i think it was 46 participants and they did angiograms angiograms is generally considered a gold standard way to look at the coronary arteries and they basically one group was just was told just do what your doctor tells you and the other group was told to exercise and go on almost a vegan diet they were allowed a little bit of skimmed milk uh but mostly vegan diet they're also told to do meditation relaxation and stretching and they did angiograms now the interesting thing is is they they they look to these angiograms that's where you shoot the blood vessels and you see how narrow they are in the heart and the people who interpreted the angiograms were involved in studies of heart disease and they basically that was their job they would interpret angiograms how narrow they for for how narrow they were and also the people who interpret the angiograms were blinded which means they did not know which group each patient was in that's what we call a good study design so there's it minimizes the biasing factors so the vertical axis is how the degree of stenosis or the degree of narrowing of the arteries and the horizontal axis is time baseline one year and five years so what you can see is out to five years in the treatment group that line it goes down and down so the proportion of narrowing the proportion of stenosis goes from roughly 40 percent down to roughly 37 so it decreases by three percent whereas the placebo group who are under the care of a specialist and we're being looked after they're narrowing increase to about 52 percent over five years so that's a big difference one group became more narrow and the other group became less narrow in the box on the right hand side of the slide i show some of the data between that shows the differences between the two groups of five years one is how much time they are exercising each week ex is the experimental group conscious the control group and one thing to be honest i found pretty amazing is the control group was exercising three hours a week 2.9 hours a week obviously they knew they were in a study and we know that being in a study changes behavior but the experimental group was exercising a little more about 3.6 hours a week they were doing 50 minutes of stress management today as against eight in the control group and fat intake this is interesting most people don't really track that sort of thing but the average north american fat intake is 30 to 35 so the control group actually decreased their fanta intake quite a bit to 25 but the experimental group were unbelievable they dropped their pant intake to about eight and a half percent after that is mind-blowingly low and it once again confirms that well they were actually on a low oil diet as well the next line is actually the cholesterol intake per day now for the control group cholesterol intake of about 140 milligrams a day that's pretty low like that's a half an egg a day uh so they were probably watching what they ate already uh but the the intervention group had about 20 milligrams of cholesterol a day so this basically the only source of cholesterol is animal products so that is meat fish eggs dairy no other animal products have cholesterol so this is a marker of how much uh animal products was in their diet so if they were having 19 milligrams of cholesterol a day they were almost vegan which is is interesting uh interestingly they're actually having more calories uh and then the adherence to score just basically measures how much they did their diet and their exercise and stuff so so here we can actually see that that in this lifestyle group uh they were mostly plant-based and it did directly affect the narrowing of their arteries so once again i saw this data so the net result of all of this is basically that i was dragged kicking and screaming into uh this plant-based diet so it took me a while i mean i you know i wish i could say i did it in a weekend but it actually it took months to make progressive changes and i kept making changes kept making changes next slide and so the next slide basically shows what happened go back sorry go backwards yeah this is actually important slides what i love about this trial is that uh it's an angiogram so people ask is heart disease reversible well if you start off a blocked area of 40 percent if you do all the right things you can bring it down to about 38 so heart disease is not a reversible condition it's a treatable condition you can actually suck out some lipid particles in there you can actually you can't change your heart calcified lesion to make that go away but you can actually make the angiogram better and heal the arteries to some degree uh so the natural progress it's a natural progression and dean or just said this really well would correlate to the maximum benefit it wasn't just a diet it wasn't that meditation it was the the total package the adherence to the whole program and as you point out in any of these programs is that people meet weekly they met in group um and all the really the successful lifestyle changes that people need to do is that very few of us can do it by ourselves and with a you know like you have a wonderful wife that's very supportive you have a great environment but it's so so to me it's it's like being in the nhl team you practice every day and you need lots of supports to make this happen so to me is that it's really important to realize is that once you have diabetes you can put into remission i don't think you can cure wipe out diabetes once you have heart disease you don't make it all go away you can improve on it and this is remarkable and i always say is that i sit on john for five minutes every day so that's my meditation time um but you can see these people spent almost an hour a day of relaxation stress management so that's actually very important concepts that to think about activity is important as well the diet's important the group support whatever it takes is this whole package because heart disease is fought on many fronts um and so this is actually done without drug therapy but the average person that i see in my clinic uh we actually did a generation project we had maybe like five people out of you know five thousand people that want to try this and to work in that area here so you're one of those people that you're one of my heroes and uh and and uh and so for for you to make those changes to make that stick what are the things that were most important to you so you had a personal invested interest but what you know what makes you so special why are you successful where most people can't do what you're doing or won't do it yeah no you're right greg i think you're absolutely right group support for most people is is absolutely essential i i suppose i suppose one of the benefits of of certain groups or certain professions is is you learn to push push yourself and so as you very well know most of us are driven people in our line of work i guess to be honest i think the thing that helped me ironically enough is is actually giving talks and teaching because i did because i gave a lot of talks and i did a lot of teaching i went through this information so many times that basically a little voice inside my head basically eventually said well you'd have to be an idiot not to do this you know you'd have to be an idiot not to make these changes and even so to be honest i think it took a it took a it took a couple of years uh for me to do this and then the final thing i suppose is of course i see patients all the time and so i would be telling them them this and then once again when you're telling other people to do something a little voice kind of tends to perch on your shoulder and say well how are you doing in that area so in a sense i was lucky that i was in healthcare i think because my teaching and my talking to others had helped me do this i guess i should say my wife was very supportive as well i had a very supportive spouse interestingly she never really liked meat either and presumably she was either used to having me around or wanted to have me around and so she got used to this information as well so to be completely honest i tend to be the one that does the talks and she tends to be the one that chops the vegetables so i absolutely give credit and kudos to her yeah um so that was that data so yeah why don't we go to the next slide to show what kind of happened over the next few years so this this table don't get intimidated by because it basically just shows the same numbers and what happened over time so my blood pressure on different dates is the first row the second row is my weight which as you can see went from about 161 pounds in september 2011 to 145 in november 2012. so in about a year i lost about 15 pounds and then it kind of slowly cruised on down to about 140 pounds so the next line is the a1c so just remember that's kind of the average blood sugar that's what i think of it as as you can see it went from 6.3 down to about 5.8 percent and it's basically sat around 5.7 still total cholesterol came down uh triglycerides uh which apparently isn't too unusual went up a whisper but fortunately they're not as strong a risk factor hdl went up which to be honest is perhaps related to exercise that can be hard to raise uh with diet to my understanding anyway ldl went down which is nice because that's a major cardiac risk factor and then this marker of inflammation which certainly on a population basis is really quite useful that actually came right down as well from 3.2 down to to uh to 0.6 so like i say this this gives you a feel of how over the over the next several years i was able to kind of bring those things down and i had to admit i was so happy with the results and i would talk to patients i it basically it eventually occurred to me that maybe some of my patients would like to not take medications and maybe some of my patients would would like to address the cause of their disease as against you know um just taking medications and so i basically started collecting things to help them make the changes and that ended up i learned something called wordpress so then i built a website about that and i actually went back to well not quite to school but i went and re-qualified in a new area of medicine called lifestyle medicine so in november 2019 so a little over a year ago i basically wrote my american exams in lifestyle medicine um that doesn't actually exist as a specialty in canada yet but it was actually an incredibly evidence-based experience so that was kind of fun uh and then i actually started uh doing a special clinic for people who wanted to adopt this plant-based lifestyle as well to kind of help them but i guess i'm getting a little ahead of myself let's move to so okay just show these numbers here so you can see that you know how low should your blood pressure be you know you're not taking any blood pressure pills that actually naturally low blood pressure of 93 or 67 is fantastic you lost 20 pounds um you still have uh the tendency towards diabetes it's something you're gonna have to fight for for the rest of your life i have the genes for for diabetes too as well in fact you said a crp of 3.2 is normal i think a crt over two is abnormal um it can be over two is a marker for increased inflammation and losing weight and exercising can lower your crt and you got that down briefly we now have drugs to do that to prevent heart disease but you did it at a natural perspective now if you had a heart attack tomorrow i'd be afraid to leave that ldl cholesterol two point five three uh the pro regression on a corn and you're gonna need the ldl less than one point zero because you're a healthy person you can get away with a higher collect bill so you're you're you've done a great job um there's always always room for improvement and i love these i love these numbers thanks a lot greg and as you say it's neat that i think you're introducing the principle that there's a continuum of risk here and that now there are interventions that can keep getting the risk lower and lower which of course is is the goal excellent okay so let's get back to some of the data so is ice does the data support this so why don't we go to the next slide so this is something called a meta-analysis each line is a different study and those little squares at the end represent a different study and and it's probably a little hard for you to see but the vertical line in the middle the one that says 0.00 at the bottom that that means uh no effect and if the box is to the left of that it means there's a benefit these are this is a meta-analysis of vegetarian diets for diabetes control so if the box if the square box is to the left of the 0.00 that favors the vegetarian diet the horizontal line that goes through each box those are called error bars and finally what they do is they summarize all of the separate studies so there's one two three four five studies they summarize them and that is that kind of um what's it called now it's not a diamond the diamond at the bottom that is the summary score and because the diamond at the bottom does not over overlap the vertical line of 0.0 that means that overall it's a significant result so what this shows is that when you combine the results of multiple studies of a vegetarian diet the net effect is that they are better for diabetes control but the final thing in this that is quite interesting is if you look in the second column it says what the diet was and the fir one two three four the first four diets were vegan diets so vegan means no animal products whatsoever so basically that means not only no meat but also no eggs and no dairy but the bottom study the one with the red box around it that was of a vegetarian diet which allowed milk and eggs why is that interesting well when you go back to the the square boxes on on the right hand side you'll see that all of the square boxes are fairly comfortable comfortably to the left of the zero line except for the bottom one the bottom one basically overlaps so it strongly implies that while the four vegan diets had a fairly big effect the quote vegetarian one that allowed milk and eggs had a smaller effect which is either depressing or encouraging depending on your perspective how much you like milk and eggs yeah whatever i didn't particularly like this but you got to follow the data anyway so this basically shows that it wasn't just one study that showed a vegetarian diet is good for diabetes control multiple studies uh have actually done that so then in the next slide i always want to put things in context and so in the next slide i tried to show the effect of drugs versus the effect of lifestyle intervention so here now each red dot is the the vertical scale on the left that is is the change in hba1c with different interventions be one two three four five the first five things are different classes of oral drugs that are used to treat diabetes soften sulfonylureas insulin releases gluconates inhibitors metformin and thiozilidines are all oral drugs and my memory's right greg i think you treat diabetes so you'd probably be pretty familiar with all of these so you can see that they get an effect of between one and one and a half percent roughly of dropping the hba1c and i haven't had the time because i'm not doing a big lecture here but there's something called a low glycemic index you can see that the effect of that is about 0.5 of a1c drop there's a structured exercise program which looks like it's about 0.6 or 0.7 percent drop in a1c and then there's a vegetarian diet which is the one that i was just showing you which drops it by 0.4 so i suppose a fair thing for a person to say is well basically pretty much each of the drugs is better than any of those three lifestyle interventions which i wouldn't really disagree with you about however we're allowed to do multiple things as dr turn you just said so dean ornish's study looked at diet meditation relaxation and exercise so if you want to fight diabetes you're allowed to do a low glycemic index diet which is vegetarian and you're allowed to do a structured exercise program and so you can expect benefits from each of those interventions so basically you can more or less out of those three dots and so when you look at the that you realize that lifestyle together can probably equal pretty much any oral drug so you know that is is really quite a a comforting thing i think so now to kind of put things in context and hopefully try and have a practical angle for people if we can just show the next slide uh i'd like to kind of show but on the left-hand side is what i showed you before which was my diet when i weighed 160 pounds and i was diagnosed as being pre-diabetic and then on the right hand side with the title of now that's my diet now that i've adopted this whole food plant-based diet etc so i went from bran flakes granola and milk now i have cut oats chia gras two tablespoons of ground flaxseed and frozen blueberries now you can basically get all of that stuff at costco or basically anywhere to be completely honest i've now gone beyond steel cut oats i have something called oat groats which i can only get through amazon but steel cut oats are just fine and i cook them we cook them in bulk so we're not cooking them every day they do take a bit longer to cook they cook take about 20 minutes to cook so you cook a pot and you keep it in the fridge for three to four days and then so you only have to cook twice a week okay so lunch used to be a whole wheat sandwich with some sort of ham veggies and a diet coke so now i have a kale salad uh i usually have some sort of beans or lentils and a handful of nuts now i have to admit i do have we all have our dark little secrets so i do struggle a little bit i do have a bit of a tendency to kind of cave and have a diet coke but now costco actually has two different brands of kombucha so for those who've never heard of it kombucha is a naturally fermented drink it's a naturally fizzy living drink it actually happens to be my favorite drink so now i go to costco get a case of kombucha bottles and i have those for lunch which are absolutely delicious so supper used to be things like spaghetti bolognese with ground beef and chicken curry and now i have some sort of veggie stir fries uh garlic ginger rice quinoa yeah there's a lot a lot of things that you can have so hopefully that gives you a uh an idea of of then and now wonderful thank you so much so um so zoys can actually sort of translate to how how that comply to many of us now what i find in many circumstances people are polarized you know i'm just going to be a plant-based year i'm not going to use medications or i'm not going to change my diet and just give me pills or or whatever so to me they're complementary look the toronto raptors are a good basketball team because they're superstars and they have bench players you got to put your whole team together and and what i hate to see this polarization sometimes from people is that that combine the best of every world and um so it's always going to tell us how to do that and what concerns i had a couple more slides on the tmao greg can i just finish that up i think i think we're just gonna we'll come back a little bit later so i think we should have to move on over here because we got i want to show people this um this stuff after so we'll come back to that a little bit later so let's move on to zoya's part is that okay sure greater zorya okay perfect we have food as prevention uh dr gangul has put a wonderful uh website together i love his website um i want you to go back and take a look at that take a picture at everybody next slide please um and here's some of the foods and um uh that is is it is this dr gangly slides over here um yeah that that's kind of the the end of the road for kind of how far you can go with food as medicine that's what a final balanced diet ends up looking like with the different portions of beans legumes lentils berries flaxseed etc so so that's basically like i say i run a separate food as medicine clinic uh and this is what we help people to kind of get to if they're willing to give things uh a trial uh for six months and this is it with group support as you mentioned dr carnew that this is highly achievable it's really the easiest way to to do something like that you know really uh the easiest way to do it and then the next slide just shows what you'd asked me to show about the tmao yeah well we'll tap on that one for now we'll keep going but now you can decide how much you want to go to to this extreme and you want this on a regular basis these are the these are the superstars of uh of eating and um we're gonna explore that a little bit more and that fantastic story thank you so much for sharing that yeah you're welcome okay perfect so thank you so much dr again guy a lot of what um he mentioned is what we're going to be covering um or breaking down in the presentation um so just briefly what is plant-based eating it focuses on foods that are primarily from plants so this doesn't just include fruits and vegetables but also nuts seeds oils whole grains legumes and beans and there's multiple variations of these diets so we have a semi vegetarian who occasionally consumes meat poultry fish or seafood a pescetarian like dr hernia consumes no meat or poultry but fish and then vegetarian has dairy and eggs included and vegan is no animal product so no dairy no meat no eggs so these are some of the major food categories um that you will see in plant-based eating in addition to nuts and seeds uh we have legumes and whole grains you can really get creative with a lot of these ingredients in plant-based eating which is really great because there's so much variety so making cooking recipes there's lots of variation and so we have kidney beans chickpeas chickpeas and other beans lentils as well and then we have tubers those are great so sweet potatoes potatoes yams beets and turnips they keep you full for um long and they're a great source of carbohydrates there as well and then we have fruits and your vegetables next slide so it's really important to find a balance um especially since a lot of times if you don't correctly um engage in a diet you can be deficient in certain minerals and um and not be getting the nutrients you need so it really is important that you do your research and make sure you're getting a good amount of carbohydrates protein calcium iron healthy fats and fiber so if we go to the next slide so we're looking at protein here so a lot of people are hesitant to go to plant-based diets because they're concerned about not getting enough protein um which they would normally be getting from meat but a lot of studies actually show that we are eating excess protein and that's due to a lot of processed foods um so there are actually a lot of variations of plant-based foods that are rich in protein so these can include nuts seeds legumes um chickpeas tofu tempeh there's lots and so if we go to the next slide i actually broke down kind of the amount and how much protein is in some of these foods and you'll notice i also put the calories there as well just so that you can keep that in mind when we get into the weight management section but so a lot of these foods do have a significant source of protein so there is a lot of variation there and you won't be missing out just because you switch over to plant-based as well another micronutrient that a lot of people are worried about that they won't be getting enough is calcium and so a lot of calcium-rich choices for those following a plant-based diet can include dark leafy greens bok choy kale broccoli a lot of calcium fortified foods and these can include non-dairy milk alternatives like soy milk almond milk cashew and other varieties and as well we have almonds there which are a great source of calcium so on the next slide as well i've just broken down how much calcium is in each of these food items and how per amount and also how many calories um so just to give you a sense of how you can incorporate this into your diet with plants okay so then next we have iron so iron is a mineral that the body needs for growth and development your body uses iron to make hemoglobin which is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all of the parts of the body so good sources of non-beam iron so this will be the iron that's found in the plant-based foods they can come from dark leafy greens dried legumes like beans and lentils soybeans spinach and the recommended daily dose of iron for those over 50 is approximately 80 milligrams for those between 19 to 50 for males it's recommended eight milligrams and for females approximately 18 milligrams and so these are great sources of iron as well next slide then we have vitamin k so vitamin k is a fat soluble vitamin and it helps make various proteins that are needed for blood clotting and also to build our bones so men 19 and older should aim for approximately 120 micrograms and women 90 micrograms of vitamin k so we tend to get quite a bit of vitamin k from our diet um which is good and then once again these are a couple of sources that are rich in vitamin k with kale and spinach being some of the top foods okay and then we're getting into vitamin b so vitamin b12 a lot of our vitamin b12 comes from animal products but there are some plant-based products that contain a fair bit of vitamin b12 the recommended daily dose i think is 2.4 milligrams sorry micrograms um so these are some of the options for plant-based eaters to get the vitamin b12 nutritional yeast seems to be quite popular and it's almost like a cheese alternative and its texture and taste um so a lot of vegans and vegetarians will find a way to incorporate this into their diets um and then as well there's some dairy options here as well which would be the greek yogurt and the cottage cheese which contain a little bit of vitamin b12 okay and then omega-3s so according to the heart foundation omega-3 fats are a type of polyunsaturated fat that's similar to other dietary polyunsaturated fats can help reduce your risk of heart disease so they can decrease the risk of clotting lower your blood triglycerides reduce blood pressure and improve blood vessel function and also delay the buildup of plaque and coronary arteries so on the next slide i have some sources of plant-based omega-3 as well so nuts and seeds tend to be the main source for omega-3 so walnuts pecans and hazelnuts and then chia seeds and flax seeds are a really good source of omega-3 so like dr yanguli mentioned in his breakfast he has some chia seeds in his oatmeal so these are really great foods to just kind of sneak into your meals throughout the day okay so with all this information on vitamins and minerals you know back when slime was light so one of the things that which you went over all the um the deficiencies that potentially can be easily corrected on plant-based heating for instance omega-3s are basically found predominantly in in fish and um they're the omega-3s dha are the ones really found in fish and alpha laminic acid is a plant-based form now the plant-based forms get have a weak conversion to the dhn's failing a couple percentile um and so there's there's all sorts of issues we talk about you can see you can be very healthy um without having to eat fish um but there's other benefits too as well as we're going to talk about then there's people like supplementation so you know what people start often saying is i can't be healthy so we hear dr ganguly saying is that he put his diabetes or potential diabetes into remission he actually decreased inflammation a good healthy diet he feels more energized and more energy um you've just shown us very easily that you can get really great nutrition from some plant-based eating and um and uh and and thank you for uh supporting that and uh next slide please go ahead there's a really wonderful well done perfect yeah so now that i've shown you kind of all the different ways to get all these essential nutrients from plants um so how do we get started so for a lot of us this can be a very difficult transition a lot of times um we've grown up with meat in our culture fast food has a lot of animal products readily available to us so making that change when we're constantly surrounded by meat can be difficult but i think it's really great to have a support system and us at the clinic here want to be that support system for you so some of the things you can do is first just eating a lot of vegetables filling your plate with at least half vegetables at almost every one of your meals is really crucial um it'll keep you full for longer a lot of people think that they won't be full following a plant-based diet because they don't feel full on salad um but incorporating a lot of fiber into your diet lettuce and such there is a way to make yourself feel full for longer so you're actually not eating as many calories but you are consuming all those great nutrients as well try to cook vegetarian meals at least once a week and so trying things like meatless monday i do have a section at the end of this video that has a lot of recipes that you can try out at least once a week and then share them with us and share them with your friends as well and then also just thinking changing the way you think about meat instead of centering your meals on the protein think of the protein more as a garnish or as a side and have the vegetables be the main part of the dish and then so for example building a meal around a salad so you can use a lot of varieties of herbs which you can actually grow in your own home which we'll show you and a lot of other vegetables to give your salads texture and once again to make you feel full for longer so before we get into the benefits of plant-based eating this is something that i just wanted to mention here what are the risk factors associated with eating red meat um high in cholesterol saturated fat lots of salt which can lead to hypertension and also tmao which dr ganguly was going to mention um but i can just mention something quickly about it it's formed by gut bacteria and it essentially it's found in red meat and at high saturated fat levels in red meat um have long been known to contribute to this heart disease um and so a number of growing studies have identified that tmao has been the culprit for this and it is complex in terms of how it exactly uh works but it has been shown to enhance cholesterol deposits in the artery wall and studies also suggest that chemicals um interact with platelets which are blood cells that are responsible for your normal clotting responses and can actually increase your risk for clot related events such as heart attacks and strokes next slide so this is kind of where the bulk of our presentation begins we will be discussing the benefits of plant-based eating so some of those include better weight management heart disease and diabetes prevention having a lighter lighter environmental footprint and there's endless creative recipes to try as well so firstly getting into weight management um so plant-based eating actually does have a lot of benefits in terms of for people who are trying to lose weight i put this pyramid diagram in here because one of the most important things in weight loss is having a calorie deficit and so plant-based eating gives you a lot of flexibility with how many calories you're able to incorporate in your diet and how full you feel um there are 3 500 calories in a pound so overall if you aim to lose a pound a week you need to be consuming at least 500 calories less or burning those off through exercise and so getting creative with plant-based meals is definitely a way to shave off those calories throughout the week so in the next slide i have a diagram here that says i'm eating healthy but i'm not losing weight um so it is possible on a plant-based diet sometimes if you're not portioning out your meals correctly that you can actually gain weight um and so some of the foods that i've listed here on this diagram such as smoothie bowls or assay bowls for example if you are eating an entire bowl and there's lots of added sugars you might not notice but the calories can creep up on you as well things like olive oil if you add a tablespoon of all bread and eating those your calories can come from there as well and then on the right side we have fruit juices a lot of fruit juices tend to contain added sugar so if you're not juicing yourself and you're someone that has a fruit juice with every meal that might be something you want to consider cutting back as well with trail mixes nuts and seeds tend to be very calorically dense so while they are really healthy for us and we can't get a lot of nutrients from them eating a lot of them in excess can contribute to those calories as well and then lastly salad dressings if you don't make your own salad dressings and you tend to use a lot of cream day style dressings like thousand island or caesar dressing calories tend to creep up on you as well there so just some things to be mindful of the next slide so this is just a slide on the beyond the meat or beyond meat which is a really popular trend that's happening right now as a plant-based meat a lot of these meats tend to be very highly processed so what i have on the slide here is an example of a tim hortons breakfast wrap with beyond meat and if you look closely at the values at the bottom there we can see that for sodium for example there is around 1190 milligrams of sodium um so the recommended intake is less than 2 300 milligrams of sodium per day and if you're following the dash diet or trying to cut back to reduce your hypertension it should be less than 1500 milligrams so this is a significant amount and it basically contributes to your entire day's worth of sodium um and it's just one wrap and then another thing to be mindful of as well as the calories so just because you're having a plant-based burger for example doesn't mean that you're going to be saving on the calories for example a w's new plant-based burger is approximately i think 500 calories um so just being mindful of when you are choosing plant-based fast-food options to be looking at the nutrition label closely as well so zoya sometimes when you know mcdonald's has their sale to [Music] two of um um to their sandwiches for for five dollars or you can get two uh the veggie burgers that harvey's on a whole wheat bun for for six dollars what's your thoughts about that as a treat is that am i fooling myself or um so harvey's actually has so we did compare this in um an earlier webinar i'm looking at fast food vegetarian options and so harvey's actually does have a veggie patty um and i think it tends to be on the lowest calories out of all the fast food restaurants that we looked at i would i think it's approximately 300 calories for the whole burger or a little bit less and so one of the things you can do to have that treat but also be health conscious is to when you're adding your toppings to the burger choosing to opt out of things like mayo or any of those heavier sauces and then just doing a little bit of mustard and then filling it up with as many vegetables as you can i think at harvey's you can just pile on as many veggies as possible um so go for the lettuce the tomatoes the onions and that should keep you full for longer and you're also getting a better deal because it's almost like a mini salad in your burger um and so that should be the lowest calorie fast food option i think yeah so next slide okay so we're just going to briefly go over the dash diet as well when we're talking about things like sodium so the dash diet is an eating plan that requires no special foods but instead provides a daily and weekly nutritional goal so this diagram kind of breaks down how many servings of each of the major food groups you should be aiming to have per day or per week so it involves eating a lot of vegetables and fruits and whole grains and staying away from high fat or highly processed products and limiting foods that are specifically high in saturated fat such as fatty meats and also avoiding full fat dairy products and then also once again limiting sugar or anything that has added sweeteners in it and so it's recommended on this diet that you have a maximum of 1500 milligrams of sodium to reduce hypertension so on the next slide one of the things the dash diet also points out to balance this reduction in sodium is to try and eat have potassium-rich foods and so i just put together a brief list here of some of the foods that are rich in potassium potatoes and sweet potatoes being at the top of the list and i think a lot of people associate potatoes now as a beer food mostly because the way that it's marketed is in potato chip or in french fry form but actually a baked potato on its own is approximately for a regular potato around 115 calories and if you just bake that and you just have one of those for dinner it can actually keep you full for a really long time so that's just something to consider that you shouldn't always you know associate these things of course if they are fried in a lot of oil or butter um they can be unhealthy for you but potatoes on their own sweet potatoes and regular potatoes have been shown to have a lot of nutritional benefits and to be full for longer so what i tend to do is just take a baked potato put a few holes in it put in the microwave i make sure i eat the skin and i don't put anything on it um and again i'm trying to replace with salt with potassium and so you can think of like a one-to-one conversion potassium has lots of benefits you mentioned previously and uh it also lowers your blood pressure in fact our weight loss club we're just starting a dash diet and that we're going to be looking at our potassium content of food right now so wonderful so um you show us a lot of wonderful feels and wonderful modifications i just remember like olive oil is a wonderful food but the problem is one tablespoon is almost 120 calories um that's a lot of calories i love peanut butter but that's no 100 calories again for a small tablespoon and i dare to say that most of us go way above those uh those limits there yeah exactly um so our next section is just gonna look at specifically some of the evidence that's out there on the benefits of plant-based eating and specifically how it contributes to heart disease prevention or reduction so the first thing i want to get into is something called the epic oxford cohort study so the european prospective investigation into cancer nutrition that's what epic stands for and the objective of this study was to examine the association of a vegetarian diet with risks of incident ischemic heart disease um so they actually recruited patients or participants for this study between 1993 and 1999 and we're still looking at data because they were followed for such a long period of time we're going to be looking at data in the next couple of slides that was published in 2020 but so essentially around 44 000 men and women living in england and scotland were enrolled in this trial so if we go to the next slide um so they were looking at specifically people who were following um one of the diets that i had mentioned earlier so either the flexitarian diet where they had fish um some fish eaters meat eaters who were allowed to have meat uh poultry and fish and then vegetarians and vegans so what they found in this study was actually that the vegetarians and the vegans had a lower mean bmi so they actually were more lean and did lose a fair bit of weight they had a lower non-ldl cholesterol concentration and also a lower systolic blood pressure and vegetarians had a 32 percent lower risk of ischemic heart disease than non-vegetarians so the overall findings from this initial trial showed that consuming a vegetarian diet was associated with lower incidence of ischemic heart disease and then also a lower cholesterol and lower systolic blood pressure so the next study that we want to look at is the broad study and this was conducted in 2017 and to investigate the effectiveness of the community-based dietary program um and the primary endpoints for this study were bmi and cholesterol at six months um so this was actually done out of a single practice in new zealand and they recruited 65 participants who were from the ages of 35 to 70 and these participants were either diagnosed with obesity or being overweight and had at least one type of type 2 diabetes ischemic heart disease hypertension or hypercholesterolemia and so the intervention in the study was that uh participants attended facilitating meetings twice weekly um so that's really what the support the group support component that dr kearney and dr gaines mentioned earlier so they were followed for 12 weeks and they were eating a wfp bee diet which is a whole food plant-based diet with vitamin b12 supplementation so for this study the conditions were that these participants followed a low-fat plant-based diet um so approximately seven to fifteen percent total energy from fat and the diet included a lot of whole grains legumes vegetables and fruits and participants were advised to eat until they felt full so they were also asked to avoid refined oils and animal products and were discouraged from high fat plant foods such as nuts avocados and highly processed foods and they were also asked to minimize their caffeine intake and sugar and salt so this is actually very interesting so to me um you know olive oils are good but some calories most of these people are trying to lose weight they met twice a week for uh for 12 weeks and they met very regularly so you know all these to me the programs have been successful at times it's hard work on on the patient's part so the individuals were highly motivated to make change um it shows basically really healthy foods and they pay attention to caloric density of foods um and and they picked a diet that was most likely to be successful um and what happened okay so on the next slide at six months the mean bmi reduction was greater with the whole food plant-based diet compared to people who were just receiving normal care um so they actually did lose weight mean cholesterol reduction was also greater with the same diet it wasn't a very significant difference but it was um of note and also hba1c reductions favored um the intervention um which was the uh whole food plant-based diet um so it did have a lot of benefits in multiple different areas and it so it led to a significant and sustained bmi and weight reduction um at all points and so i think what was really important here was the group aspect not only were the patients highly motivated and and eating very healthy but also having that point of connection with someone else where um they're able to kind of understand what you might be going through as well as all patients in the trial did have either obesity or diabetes or some chronic condition and then really building that support group and motivating one another to continue doing this because you want to get healthy um so i think that was one of the things i really took away from the study was that group component okay so on the next slide and this is just new evidence that we wanted to mention here as well so as i mentioned a few slides ago we were discussing the epic oxford study um and so there's been new data that's been published um suggesting that veganism has some implications on bone health um so there are approximately 65 000 men and women across the uk um that were recruited between 1993 and 2001 and so they were followed because this was a longitudinal study they were followed over a certain period of time and so the diets that these participants were following were either meat eaters fish eaters vegetarians or vegans so like i mentioned those descriptions before they had people from each one of these different categories so on the next slide we can kind of see the results of this study so compared with meat eaters vegetarians and vegans did have a higher risk of total fractures um the potential risk differences was attributed to substantially lower intakes of calcium in vegans and lower intakes of dietary protein in both vegetarians and vegans so this is one of the things this is why i mentioned early on in the presentation a lot of vegetarian sources of calcium and protein because it is important that if you are following a vegan or vegetarian diet that you are actively trying to incorporate those into your diet and then as well i think the risk of hip fracture was higher in fish eaters vegetarians and vegans and vegans had a higher risk of total fractures even after they adjusted for socioeconomic status lifestyle and bmi so non-meat eaters especially vegans had higher risks of either total or some site-specific fractures particularly hip fractures okay so now stewart is just going to briefly get into the title slide there is that one of the reasons that they had more fractures is what they they they were they were skinnier and so unfortunately fat protects so um so being overweight does that actually cause more ankle fractures but it causes uh less vertebral hip fractures so um i want to be skinnier and and fit so what this this tells me is that there's lots of dyes to pick from but being a phenomenally plant-based eating with a whole wheat uh products and uh can really make a huge difference in your your cardiovascular health so there's lots of diets out there but this just tells the tremendous results you show us the the dash trial that that can lower blood pressure there's a vegetarian diet as well but uh this this diet of you know phenomenal plant-based eating is gaining traction and as we talk about you can do it uh one day at a time as you can talk about in a few minutes from now um it doesn't usually exclude um um you know the traditional medication route uh the vascularization and so many people have actually opted to supplementation um so uh plant-based ears if you're really too vegan that you might need to have some some d12 uh other than that but you can still get that to other sources too as well so uh students can tell us about uh well i'll just take some i don't care about all this stuff just give me some pictures and some like this reason uh and some vitamin d what happens we just do that stuart sure so the next trial that we're going to be talking about is the vital trial vital trials stood for vitamin d and the omega-3 trial this was a randomized controlled trial oftentimes considered one of the highest forms of evidence and what they were trying to investigate as dr kearney prefaced was whether supplements would be able to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in populations that didn't have a prior history of cardiovascular disease so what they wanted to specifically look at was whether vitamin d or whether omega-3 fatty acid oils would help to reduce cardiovascular risk now this was a randomized control trial i could see dr cooney grabbing his pills right here so i'm going to throw it to him afterwards but this was a randomized control trial of over 25 000 american men and women the men were greater than 50 years old and the women were greater than 55 and now how they organize this study was they randomized individuals one to one to two different groups one was either the vitamin d versus the control group and the other one was the omega 3 fatty acids versus the placebo or control group the primary endpoints they were concerned about was cardiovascular risk heart attack cancer and stroke and this was a really long study they followed individuals for over the course of 5.3 years on average they they did a follow-up every single year and they reviewed their charts to see if they had any um significant uh history throughout those five years and what they found was that for vitamin d let's go supplementation and slight story so the dose of vitamin d is 2 000 units of good stuff uh so two thousand it's a good dose of vitamin vitamin d um and the fish oils were a thousand milligrams of dha epa the standard fissile which you can get um notice that there if you have epdha you don't get fully 1000 milligrams because there's all sorts of fillers in vitamin or omega-3 preparations and they actually used a high grade of this list to look at this the reason they took people with age of 50 years of age unfortunately as you get older risk of cancer heart disease goes up and so a clinical trial looks at event points so so that's why they they chill through those 50 years of age so well done randomized controlled trial went on for five years so a long duration of therapy here and the the final results that they found was that the vitamin d supplementation and the omega-3 fatty acids did not significantly reduce the risk of cancer or cardiovascular events such as mi stroke or cardiovascular related death vitamin d they found might reduce the risk of cancer-related death but they concluded that further research is needed to determine whether there is an overall benefit to vitamin d and they found that the omega-3 fatty acids did reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients who had a low fish diet but again this was some somewhat of a hypothesis and they required more research and so as a conclusion they said that based on the current research the vitamin d supplementation did not necessarily lower the risk of cancer or cardiovascular events and in terms of omega-3 fatty acids dr kearney did you want to share your information on on on your thoughts regarding omega-3 fatty acids so this is actually one of many trials with omega-3s and vitamin d this is the first of all for vitamin d is that taking 2 000 units of vitamin d on a regular basis and 5 000 healthy people did not do really much good you can torture the data a little bit to try to get something from cancer but overall this is a bust so if you know you're going to take vitamin d in the hope of preventing cancer and heart disease you're wasting your money um the omega-3 story has actually gotten quite complicated in in omega-3s there's something called dha epa and there's alpha-linic acid so they talked about alphalanic acid which is a vegetable form found things like chia seeds etc but overall to me is that it's that cocktail that combination approach of the diet and trying to tease out supplementations doesn't appear to be to be working right now so a lot of people are spending billions of dollars on supplements the people who benefit the most are the people supplying you with the vitamins uh this is it's good for the heart good for the brain it's good for their pocketbook bad for yours so i think this is a terrible investment in fact the only um fish oil preparation that's been shown to be valuable uh right now something called the sipa that's pure epa and we're going to talk about that at a later date we have a webinar on this right now so this is very disappointing um supplements just don't work um on a large scale basis so at least for for heart disease and cancer uh so uh we'll look at that more in a more deeper way so to me is that you can't replace good old hard work of exercise enjoying the exercise enjoying cooking um enjoying the get to that get together but unfortunately geez that's too bad just it just didn't work and if you're looking to learn more stay tuned for a future webinar where we're probably going to be discussing more on vitamins and supplements as well in greater detail what does work though is pure epa 4 000 milligrams a day but we'll talk about a separate discussion right now since for cardiovascular health it works tremendously well but just get it over the counter the next what we wanted to transition into discussing is the third part of our presentation the environmental impact of a plant-based diet so let's talk about our footprint livestock is considered to be responsible for about 18 of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet more specifically beef and milk products produce 41 and 20 percent of these missions respectively intensive livestock production is also responsible for a large part of the loss in biodiversity due to plant life use for grass and feed and defeat crops and so not only is our carbon footprint having an impact on our own health but it's also having an impact on the other animals who are currently occupying our planet as well now how does organic food consumption contribute to environmental sustainability well according to the food and agricultural organization adopting sustainable diets at a global level is urgently needed sustainable diets should include a large share of ecologically based local and minimally produced products and limited consumption of animal products and over produced milk products as well environmentally friendly habits include reducing the consumption of these animal products as mentioned and increasing the consumption of a plant-based diet now on the next slide here we have some data to show you on the left diagram right here you'll see that the greenhouse gas emissions from many of the common foods on the horizontal axis you'll see many of the common foods as you'll see in this section over here majority of it is meat and produce you can see that meat and produce contributes the most significantly to total emissions the light green bar is an indication of how much emissions are released during production and the little teal portion at the top relates to the processing the transport and the waste disposable so as you can see many plant-based ingredients lentils tomatoes tofu just to name a few contributes far less to greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the meat and the poultry of the world now if we look on the other side right here we'll talk about how much water is required to prepare many of these foods again a very similar trend a far more greater significance is attributed to beef and meat and poultry products compared to plant-based ingredients such as vegetables and fruits and so not only is it contributing to a significant use of water which is quite costly as well but it's also as i mentioned contributing far more significantly to greenhouse gas emissions on our planet so let's talk a little bit about gardening so gardening is a fantastic fantastic idea and we strongly encourage anyone to grow their own garden it doesn't have to be something that you do outside as you can see here you can also buy a few jars and create your own little garden inside your house as well i talked in a previous webinar about how my family is trying to go a little bit more green in terms of the way that we're eating a little bit more organic throughout the summer we use many organic ingredients which we buy from terra and other greenhouses to be able to balance our diet with many vegetables and herbs that we grow at home it's a great way to reduce plastic use and save yourself a ton of money not just throughout the summer season but also throughout the winter as well and not only are they a great source of nutrients but they're also a great source of flavor without adding any significant calories now if you wanted to go a step further i wanted to introduce something called the hamilton best victory gardens hamilton victory gardens is a non-profit organization based in hamilton ontario this was started in 2011 by two hamilton individuals who wanted to really make a change um they noticed that there was a lot of empty space in hamilton that was currently not used and they thought meant much of it could be used towards creating plants and gardens and growing their own herbs and crops which they could donate to food banks and places in the community that were in greater need if this is something that you are interested in joining and being a part of we have added the website to the description of our video you can sign up as a volunteer you can sign up as a coordinator you can learn more about how they're making a difference in the local hamilton community and it's a great way to give back not only to the environment but also to the the people of hamilton as well and as we move on to the next slide here i wanted to transition to about as far away from earth as you can possibly get right now let's talk about the uh the recent landing of the mars rover for those who don't know um on thursday the mars rover named perseverance landed on the red planet uh successfully and the entire objective is to essentially look through the planet and see if there's anything any signs of life any signs of biodiversity both past and present i think the naming is is really cute perseverance because it kind of draws into the next topic that i wanted to discuss so i thought you know what let's pack our bags and let's head to mars ourselves so dr kearney and i have countless discussions in the past about what we feel are essential ingredients or or things that every person should have so we wanted to list off a few here so for those who are joining us right now these are some of the essential things that we think are great for your health and great for the environment as well so the first thing is space boots um they look a little something like this here on earth a pair of good running shoes um getting exercise about 30 minutes a day three to four times a week we've talked about it in many webinars you can find them in other webinars we've filmed fantastic way for your for your health um fantastic for both your physical and mental health uh whenever you go for a run or whenever i go for a run at least i always feel a little bit better and a little bit less stressed out about all the things that have been weighing on me so uh getting your exercise has dual purposes the next thing of course why not get yourself a zero gravity bike as well be careful out there the roads are kind of slippery these days but if you have a clear trail that's paved off you know biking isn't just a summer activity the next thing is your outer space garden i've already talked a great lens about it again you can visit the hamilton victory gardens website if you want to contribute to the community or if you want to do it on your own you're more than welcome to um watch some of our previous videos as well where we've talked about how to create your own garden i would certainly recommend looking into our video with chad where he discussed at great lengths about his plant-based diet and finally you need your mars materials for the kitchen you need a good frying pan some aluminum pots a good sharp knife to cut up your vegetables if you were to head to mars today you wouldn't need anything more than this maybe maybe one or two shirts but nothing more than that and of course uh i i texted dr kearney earlier today and i asked him if you had one word of advice for the patients today what would it be and he shared with me oh can't forget a space helmet that you need a desire to always get better don't be afraid to make mistakes if you really want to improve and that led me to this pun that i've been sitting on all day which i wanted to share with you being healthy isn't rocket science but like the mars rover it takes perseverance so you can you can fall down as many times as uh as you're gonna fall down many times i've done it personally i know dr kernu has as well we've talked about it many times before but it's not how many times you fall down it's how many times you get back up and learn from those experiences so as uh dr ganguly mentioned at the very beginning of our webinar it wasn't a a night and day shift from going towards a plant-based diet but it was something he was committed to and over the course of several years he was able to get better at and he's seen the benefit it's had both on his energy level and also on a biological level how it's affecting his heart as well i'm speechless thank you thank you so we'll transition away from mars and we'll come back down to earth let's talk a little bit about sunlight um these days it's very difficult i know to leave the house sometimes it's it's difficult to have the motivation but i wanted to briefly discuss some of the benefits of just getting 30 minutes of sunlight a day and how this can have a benefit on your health both in the short term and the long term the first benefit of course is vitamin d production we've all heard of that one before vitamin d is essential for our bones very similar to plants you can almost say we photosynthesize so we need good sunlight as well to be able to have good bone health especially at a younger age but recent studies i looked at one systematic review from 2007 i've also suggested that vitamin d production and getting those sunlight even in your older in your older years can have a tremendous impact on preventing osteoporosis it also has a good auto immune protection to keep you from prevent prevent you from getting sick it also helps to release endorphins which are natural stress relievers it also helps to release serotonin serotonin it just makes you feel good it's a hormone that makes you happy and by releasing more serotonin in the day it also triggers your melatonin cycles earlier in the evening so that also helps you to get a better sleep so sunlight throughout the day has been attributed to preventing insomnia and helping you get a better quality sleep as you age so exposure to sunlight every day has tremendous health benefits we recommend that you don't forget your sunscreen and these days don't forget your mask either so one thing to remember is that um you know being outside and when it's safe to be outside is a great thing and when the warmer weather comes is that my best source of vitamin d is going to be 30 minutes of sunlight on my arms and my legs then i'll put the sunscreen on afterwards and i think that's important so is that there's a whole controversy about you know vitamin d for diseases such as covet 19 to to falls to um to cancer and to heart disease but so far is that i think going outside for 30 minutes for a walk with those space boots on the planet earth would be a good idea when that when on sun per minutes and expose your arms and your legs uh get make your own vitamin d um and that's a good thing you know some people might need some supplementation but i think getting outside um for for your health when when uh when you can do that is wonderful whether or not you can take vitamin d in the winter time we'll come back to talking about vitamin d in more detail later date but overall just blanket supplementation of vitamin d or blanket supplementation of epa and dha you know total lust at this point in time so uh um but what i'm hearing is that with group together meditation relaxation sunlight eating uh replace what's white with green in your diet tremendous benefit from quality of life and to make you make it a little longer we didn't really talk about this as well but uh plant-based eating may decrease cancer by about 30 as well so lots to think about very briefly let's talk about the benefits of reducing food waste so there are a few benefits which include of course saving money time and resources for yourself you'll be buying less food reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions in the world which tends to come from landfills and your dairy farms and also so essentially also it helps to conserve energy and resources which is involved in growing manufacturing transporting and selling products and it helps also helps you of course live better so by eating fresher organic local ingredients instead of going for over produced meats and overproduced milk products we've talked about it at great lengths earlier today that it can have a tremendous benefit on your health as well finally i wanted to touch briefly on composting so for composting um we just have a few recommendations for you first select and store food scraps so we recommend placing your fruit grinds your eggshells your peels your tea bags and your coffee grinds into a container and freezing them for compost locations choose a place for your compost whether it's in your backyard in the garden somewhere in the community in a green space etc we off also in terms of mixing mix your greens and your browns so your greens are your food scraps your browns are your carbon rich ingredients such as your egg cartons newspapers dried leaves and pine needles and finally weight and airy you can mix compost mix to fertilize your garden soil so that you can kind of give back to the planet and help to grow your future vegetables and fruits and just a a conversation relating to saving your food scraps uh chad who is a dear friend of ours and who's been involved in a previous video on his food diary where he explained everything he eats in a day or in a week of course chad is a full plant-based eater he shared how he um saves his food scraps to make his own broths for soups which he uses as appetizers to his evening meals so if that's something that you're interested in and learning about the great health benefits of creating your own bras be sure to check out this video on our youtube page which we filmed a few months back and we're also going to add the description or the link to this video in the description of this webinar perfect so now we're just going to get quickly into some creative recipes i think a lot of people are scared to go plant-based as well because they're not really sure what options are there for them and i think it might be extra time they have to take out of their day to make these meals but i'm just going to show you how easy it actually is so one of the first things we have here is soups um so going off of what chad has mentioned before with food scraps a great thing to do is take them and make your own vegetable broth base i think dr kearney has been having lots of soups at the clinic as well just taking some broth and putting some spinach and other vegetables in there so that keeps you full for a long time and is is a really great warm meal to have in the winter and so you can really add anything to your soups if you make the vegetable base yourself you can store it in your fridge or in your freezer and then you can just add whatever vegetables you feel like for that meal as well there's a great video that we have on soups and smoothies and so i really just wanted to touch on smoothies here but smoothies are a great way to get in those extra nutrients as well so if you start off with a base like almond milk or soy milk it does have a fair bit of calcium and protein and then you can add whatever fruits you'd like to keep you full and then to that you can also sneak in your vegetables there so you can add spinach and kale and blend it up and if you're not if you're someone who doesn't like the taste of them um that can really help with minimizing the taste and then you can also add things like chia seeds and flax seeds to your smoothies for those extra nutrients and then top it off with any type of nut butter or greek yogurt i would just caution that a lot of times smoothies can be very high in calories if you are adding a lot of extra or added sweeteners any sugar or anything like that so just try to use as many organic ingredients as you can okay on the next slide these are just some alternatives i would encourage you to try especially if you're doing things like meatless monday there's a lot of easy swaps here so for example using a spiralizer and spiralizing noodles from zucchini you can do it with carrots and other vegetables as well and if you're still adjusting and you can't really take the full taste of all of these vegetables at once you can mix half of the zucchini noodles with half a portion of whole wheat pasta and you'll still be saving some calories there as well on the next slide we have taco tuesday with half the calories so i would encourage you instead of using your traditional taco shell or tortilla to try using lettuce as almost like a bowl or something to hold your um the base of your meal in so you can do lettuce wraps you can do lettuce tacos um and so these are just some of the ingredients you can add and it's really up to you you can mix and match and the great thing with vegetables is there's so many options that every day of the week you can have something different and then lastly on the last slide we're not quite in summer yet but especially during barbecue season and such using lettuce and bell peppers as a substitute for bread is also a great way to save on calories and get your veggies in um so just some food for thought there and so on the next slide i have a lot of images from forks over knives and one of the things that they did in the um in the broad studies they actually showed the forks over knives movie and it's a really great movie and they now have an entire franchise that basically has a lot of really great vegan recipes and they're really easy to make i've tried a couple myself and they don't take a lot of time and they're also using a lot of budget friendly ingredients like chickpeas cauliflower things you can buy in bulk so these are just some colorful images of different recipes you can try out at home and i can i think we've linked forks over knives the website as well for you to check out in a later slide but on the next slide as well i just have a lot of colorful images to show you how creative you can really get with and face feeding so one thing about forks over knives it's a it's a wonderful video um there's also a new video called the need to grow that uh at one point but uh chad and i took a vegetarian plant-based eating course and uh we had so much fun doing this um um chad did all the work i did all the eating um and i learned so much about uh how to how to use a sharp knife and actually for christmas i my wife got me some brand new knife sets and so i have some sharp mothers to make sure i don't cut myself i learned how to shop from different things and uh so on your trip to mars that you need you need that you need a good sharp knife to uh chop them vegetables yeah and then just to end off i know that a lot of times we don't really talk about dessert um but there are ways to get creative with plant-based eating and desserts as well and and these are just some of the desserts i found took really no time so for example just having frozen fruit is a great way to incorporate something sweet but low calories and also low sugar and then if you want to get creative and you really want to treat yourself you can dip them in greek yogurt or some peanut butter and freeze them and they're a really refreshing snack um as well something interesting that i found i didn't really think of that incorporating potatoes into dessert was possible but sweet potato bites you can use any type of like a sweet potato or a yam and just mash it up you can add a little bit of sugar or a little bit of maple syrup where if you don't want any of the seasoning if you find the taste of sweet potatoes are very sweet you don't need to and then you just add a little bit of seasoning and some ground nuts and they form a really nice ball shape and then they're easy to store in a container you can even freeze them and save them for a later time and then lastly a chia seed pudding so using almond milk chia seeds a little bit of maple syrup and some fresh fruit in there as well it's another great way to sneak in things like chia seeds or flax seeds or any type of seeds that you want so that's the end of our recipe portion these are just some helpful links and forks over knives is right here at the bottom so i would definitely encourage everyone to check these out just to learn more about your health and also try things on your own and if you try out any of these recipes at all we would love if you sent them to us and showed them how they worked out for you hey would you look at that we have a new club at the clinic to join so we want to ask you are you doing

seeds you're gonna take there i'm not quite sure yet but we'll figure that out let's see what grows on mars let's find out how much water is on ours there so i'm waiting for um elon musk and nasa to tell us about that yeah i'm not an astrophysicist but i did look up what mars atmosphere is like and whether it can sustain vegetables on mars i don't think it is i think mars is about negative 60 degrees and has a very weak atmosphere but you know what early days in this research world we're going to figure it out how we're going to do it like you said i think maybe elon musk will figure it out at some point and on the next slide here we just wanted to briefly show you some of the other focus groups that we have at the clinic we have a smoking cessation group on tuesdays and thursdays

plant-based eater started off at one of our breakfast sessions we had a pancake breakfast we went for a walk and it started off with a bet that i couldn't be vegetarian for 30 days uh uh i i did pretty well you know you know i'm not sure how long right now i was able to uh to get myself to a healthier weight to be more more fit and uh but the number one reason i plant based either is for the help the animals second is the planet and dirt is health and uh so uh that triple combination uh is great there's other great diets out there too as well you can still be very healthy and be a meat eater uh you can still uh the other forts of diet but um that combination to me was is important and uh so you have to decide for yourself whether or not you want to do meatless mondays or uh go to a higher level um i'm trying to decide what to do about fish over time so um something that uh i i think i'm gonna actually migrate away over time um but uh you know it's like um it's been a wonderful journey i've explored so many new tasting new foods uh and i've met so many wonderful people along the way and uh wonderful experiences stuart are there any questions or comments from anybody in the uh out there no questions but if anyone does have any questions please send them now so we can answer them before we sign off but at the moment there's no questions well uh sure once you once i'll give you the last word and uh i want to thank everybody zoya stewart fantastic dr gangly it's fantastic and uh i just noticed that uh joanne and philip just destroyed off recently uh phillips another physician uh who basically had heart disease and um feels he's putting his heart disease into uh to regression to somebody he's a basically a plant-based eater i see john aitken was on there recently he's become a plant-based year it seems like a lot of physicians are becoming plant-based eaters from that so if people in the know are doing it why aren't you considering that a little bit more but they're also smart too as well they're not denying the natural things of surgery so uh dr deakin had previous surgery um and both of them are taking very aggressive cholesterol medications including psk9 drugs and conventional medications and combining the best of the best of modern day medicine and the best of um of uh eating uh and lifestyle changes so uh i wish everybody a healthier path to getting a little bit healthier and enjoy the journey and keep trying something new and i want to get everybody good night and thank you all for uh for participating letting us support you in any

kedo you can have all the butter okay so we go take a little butter take that much and we're going to melt the butter we're gonna milk seed butter on stairs no I'm not making it with cauliflower I'm making it with oh I didn't think about what if I would have graded some cauliflower in it would it give me the same cauliflower wouldn't give me the texture of corn inside I thought about Darius I said Gary ass leave well enough alone okay please all right since we not doing a cornmeal you know what we do we are doing for me we're going to do some super fine natural almond flour okay that's what we gonna do keep y'all praying I hope so all right let's go make some cornbread corn okay here we go all right just one cup two cups okay this is very this is very um natural now we got a sweetener okay you know me you know I like a sweet cornbread all right so we have we don't use sugar no more sugar this don't look that bad this looked like cornmeal if you look at it real good it

this is golden monk fruit sweetener okay golden one crew sleeping is kind of like it's kind of like brown sugar okay I'm gonna put that much that's about a half a cup I don't want to put a full cup

what my grandmother would do she would also do this as well and make a drink so that's what we're gonna do in the spirit of my grandmother we're gonna go whip it up okay buttermilk we shake this up a little bit whole room okay buttermilk is in here I don't know how much we're looking for a certain consistency right this look like cornbread a little bit not just don't look too bad people just on

that's why I got something left I was gonna put a little piece of sour cream in one that's what I post ahead did well okay look so in just leftover batter down here we're gonna put us a little piece of sour cream you ain't you ain't forgot so we got okay we got two without sour cream and we got one with sour cream we're gonna see which one tastes better huh come on real fast I forgot I was too busy talking to y'all the oven at 375 I believe 375 would give us a good a good browning don't worry though I don't put the recipe I'll put the recipe in the in the vegan book I mean in the kid oh boy I saw a Facebook group so make sure you okay make you joined Aikido but with Seoul Facebook group and I'll make sure you get down it just like it's a little loose to me it's like a little okay let's pull it in there let's got the sour cream in it same prayer low amen okay as I was saying the corn bread recipe is in the cookbook okay so if you don't have the cookbook you can you should get it the butter pecan cornbread recipe is in the stories from our grandmother's kitchen cookbook and the honey butter cornbread the vegan honey butter cornbread is in here okay the cold to use you use the code key dough and then you could say you know your gone here save you 25% okay because everything is right here Darrius cooks TV hey man okay now let's talk about these states if you just joined us first of all let me say good evening to you and happy Sunday all right this is what we doing we have some collard greens in the instant pot the instant pot that's right here next to me you can't see it and I'm scared to move it because you know if you move it it's got the steam and stuff built up and it scares me they do so I'm not gonna move it til I unplug it but if you use your imagination it's right and if you listen carefully listen that's the instant pot working on our behalf okay so all we did was put the smoked turkey turkey tails and the collard greens in there with some oil and some beef stock you could use water but water don't have that much flavor you could use the water but to me water don't have enough flavor you should I'm saying so I like to put a little extra in mind all right [Music] also we went ahead and made this Keitel cornbread because we're gonna see what it's hitting oh okay Kito corn bread we made it with the almond flour we use this y'all be asking me what kind of sugar we use just the kind of sugar we use okay this is me from mark through and it's all natural and that's what we use then okay we sweeten it with that and then we put the baking powder in there some butter opposed to have put the sour cream in there but I forgot so I made two without the sour cream I made one with the sour cream and what we're gonna do is taste it and see which one we like the best now we're gonna make these steaks with a little tequila lime butter because tequila is key no lie mosquito butter is kedo and steaks Akito a man okay now the other day what I did was I had a whole rib roast okay sorry dude Ciroc BS is getting to me we had a whole rib roast I cut the rib roast into portions like this then what I did with the rib roast was I seasoned it we made our own steak seasoning was this yesterday we did this no not yesterday about two days ago I think we did this anyway i seasoned it with my own stick it was starting Friday what's today Sunday the other day and what I did was I seasoned it with my own steak seasoning okay I made one live for you you don't have to do that what you could have done is you could use or break on the steak seasoning off the job I made my own please don't ask me what I put in here please do not ask me what I put in here because I don't remember rosemary coriander I don't know I didn't put that much salt in here so we're gonna put some more salt on here now this is the key these steaks set in the refrigerator uncovered for a couple of days like 48 hours what that does is it draws out the moisture on the steak right and also what it does is after it draws out the moisture it really ten suffice the beef flavor you ever have you ever go to the steakhouse then they have the dry aged steak that's what we just essentially D it down to the house okay down to the house we made dry-aged steaks okay the longer you let this sit the better it becomes but this is gonna be great all right I'm just putting a little olive oil and salt down on top of the steaks cuz you don't want them to burn right and you want them to get some flavor in there and that flavor gonna come from the salt because salt gonna help bring out all the other flavors now these are ribs but just don't have to be a rebound New York Strip believe me y'all you name it on it don't matter okay all right the pan behind me is getting nice and hot we're gonna put these tapes off in the cast-iron hold up that's what you want to hear that's what you want here let me show while you what look at this is getting nice and good okay now to keep to a good state because this exalts the hold on one thing but cities don't stone put yours on stone is gonna be a mess the key to a good steak it's putting it down there and being not touching we go touch it all right we gotta do a few more things I'm a licking our cornbread cornbread I gotta turn this off it don't look half bad now it ain't looking like the regular cornbread but it don't look at that okay let me get a little Bowl so we could see the my greens now I'm a seasoned the green when they done because I'm looking to lose their flavor you could have seasoned them beforehand but what I find is when you season greens from the beginning you got the going v season them at the end so we're gonna put garlic powder now this recipe is everywhere this recipe is in all the cookbooks all right and all this is speaking you know what somebody told me a drink somebody told me you got to be careful how much seasoning you add cuz the seasoning got carbohydrates in it I say what total carbohydrates zero okay ten this up okay ten this up all right onion powder garlic powder a little chicken base okay a little chicken base to get them down all right a little chicken base together all right a little Cajun seasoning no piece of red pepper flakes all right little piece of red pepper flake as spicy as you like it you go for it a little piece of black pepper and I see your comments too about my little piece a little piece all right and a little piece of sugar or in this case you want fruit sweetener okay because you need something to help bring out their claims let's turn our steak you see that hello can you see that huh this is what I'm talking about when you don't touch it and you let it sit and fear carefully you end up with dinner okay in the oven let's go okay so that's my trick I like to put them in the oven and then let that go okay so this is the green seasoning can I tell you a secret can I tell you one secret if you wanted to put you a little piece of accent in here ain't nobody gonna say nothing to you okay if you want it to put you a little piece of accent in here and nobody gonna say nothing see you I'm not gonna say nothing I'm not gonna put none in here but a little piece I'll get you what you got to go okay now this is um I only added two like soups and stews when ain't nobody look okay well ain't nobody looking okay so this is the green seasoning and this ready to go all right for us now we need to go make this butter for the steaks okay so remember I started melting the butter that I've used with cornbread well I'm gonna so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna infuse some flavor into this butter let me grab a knife my good night that I was just shopping the other day there you go you know the let's be ready okay don't nothing be ready about it okay come on this is garlic okay now we're gonna smash this garlic cuz we're gonna make like a little sauce just gonna go over our steak cuz the steak is gonna be ready it's gonna be intensified because of all that that good that good beef flavor and it's seasoned well but we gonna make it over the top okay now listen don't forget couple things before I forget one you could join the vegan but with soul Facebook group we have a keto but with soul Facebook group and we have a bigger but with soul cookbook today only 25% off use the cold keto at checkout okay and then you can save you 25% this what I'm doing I'm not looking like what's going on look you put your garlic down you put your knife on like this and you smash it that you get it like this it like this okay look at this you put this on here like this put your knife down be careful that you smash it and that's how you chop up your garlic okay you smash it like that and then to make it so much easier now to get in here and chop up the garlic that's a little pro tip in case you didn't know okay here's the garlic all this garlic into that butter okay because what we're doing now is we're infusing flavor if you don't know anything about me I like lots of flavor okay so we're infusing nothing but flavor into this butter so the butter and the garlic start out when you look nice onion listen the people that tell you you can't have onions cuz you're doing cheeto your own macros people okay do your own macros okay and it be the main ones who ain't got a doctorate the first no medical degree and even finish college we want to tell you how are you supposed to be doing on keto okay listen don't listen to him don't listen to him all right we're not gonna put a lot of onion in here but listen what we gonna do is you're gonna infuse flavor into this butter because the butter is gonna be what we use to finish up our sauce sweet you follow me come on chop this up small you're doing a small dice you could use a shallot if you wanted to you can use shallots in wrong dad shallots are like fancy onions but a little red onion works or you know what if you don't have red on your white onion yellow onion I just like the juxtaposition against the onion and the garlic because the onion lands a bit of sweetness that the stars could use okay all right so this goes in here like that all right so what we got going on yeah I'm in we got a girl y'all see that okay we got the season this with a little salt pepper salt a little pepper we're doing a tequila lime butter little red pepper flakes and then look limes okay now normally I would use the zest but I'm not going to use the zest in here because what I find is that the zest don't taste that good once you cook it down and this supposed taste good okay well thanks good so we're gonna go and put the juice in here let me get a little something juicy we gonna squeeze the juice in him by the way blueberry acai diet coke with a little I don't drug it all it's a drop left this is Surratt vs okay delicious I don't feel a thing all right come on let's juice our lines okay come on we're gonna juice our lines now I like to put the you know I for my lungs you know that

you're a nice medium we take oh that's a key the lime butter we just made and we pour this this has the shallot I mean the onion the garlic the tequila okay and this is just gonna add another level another layer of flavor we're not gonna eat all the butter okay but lord knows it's gonna infuse nothing for great flavor inside okay this is the this is the little piece of cornbread we got let me

you there's two things I want to tell you as I always do food is my life life is my food until next time I do want to wish you a happy cooking and eating tomorrow they are by", "rhJhGpWrL6Y": "so good evening everybody a glioma Charlotte condom I love bugs in infection mainly infections in pregnancy okay a mold or failure to e how well suppose so to get my actor Leno had them in a little more DSR hadn't finished early Lada so which of the following is not an intrauterine infection parvovirus varicella-zoster virus rubella while gonorrhea table an I wanted at all healed parvo virus 12 Ursula zoster well rubella those are viruses that can be transferred transparently to the fetus so there are internal infections al gonorrhea is not an internal infection so we're gonna start with the varicella zoster infection very cellular it's a double-stranded DNA virus 95% of adults have serological immunity yanny when you were a child you will probably exposed the whole chicken pox at the whole angus for 90 95 percent of the population are immune it's transmitted by direct contact or respiratory droplets an incubation period Tiger to become from 10 to 21 days it's highly contagious from day one before the onset of the rash until the the lesions crest yeah I mean a most infectious period had little bit wound one day before the onset of the rash until enough cell rush had the lesion deserialize elphaba gazelle crest scada the man had a shackle in who had chickenpox okay so you can see calf idol crusted legions had encrusted lesions the Ebola as they'll visit killer rush so it's like papules le beacon Jewett Iselle fluid table and intrauterine when it's transmitted it can cause malformation one of the maps mission it can cause skin anomalies and bone anomalies when I take the ritual focus and skin kn-know burned while Alphonse qaddafi disproportion fee albums ativan haha lol vaccine presentation eternal usually a few days I couldn't have flu-like symptoms but kilobit surrender help related vesicular lesions that crest over three to seven days mortality is high in adults five to twenty percent developed pneumonitis death sorry Hannah death usually become due to pneumonia fatal I'll first have me develop congenital rubella syndrome what are the features Baku nearly one corner and try this micro found me a cerebral cortical atrophy IUGR hydronephrosis skin lesions and atrophy and atrophy of the bone but on timing of the exposure is very important and it estimates it awhile fetal risk the kernel exposure before thirteen weeks of gestation the fetal risk pick one point one point four percent if the exposure is between 13 to 20 weeks then the fetal risk is 2% if the exposure if after 20 weeks there's no evidence of congenital infection what are the symptoms and risk factors for maternal pneumonia so the symptoms usually they will present with chest pain shortness of breath cough fever aching pain and tachycardia the risk factor is usually having more than a hundred skin lesions or if she's a smoker L diagnosis usually it's by tissue culture you can do xanax Mir director recent antibody testing nucleic acid amplification test and what is the most sensitive the most sensitive test is the nucleic acid amplification test I'll tear apart Imperial beacon before or during delivery transmission risk is about 25 to 50 percent 25 percent mortality rate they should receive a little IVIG five days before delivery or two days after the IVIG should be given to the new nades as well non-immune female should receive visit within 96 hours of exposure to prevent infection in fact a patient should be isolated if pneumonia is diagnosed they should be admitted and they should receive acyclovir ll vaccinations usually two doses four to eight weeks apart and it's not recommended during pregnancy so if you do a serology for a woman before she gets pregnant she should have the vaccinations and contraception for at least two months and then she can plan to get pregnant regarding the rubella virus so it's an RNA Tolga virus incubation period is about 12 to 24 days usually the patient will have flu-like symptoms arthritis arthralgia a rash that starts on the face then the extremities and its associated with lymph adenopathy viremia precedes the clinical symptoms by one week it's highly infectious in the seven days of the rash the congenital infection and the transmission to the fetus if less than 12 weeks the that transmission is 90% or the fetus will have an infection in 90% of the cases from 13 to 14 weeks 50% and the risk decreases with increased age the diagnosis you can isolate it in the urine nasopharyngeal or cerebral spinal fluid the IgM indicates active or recent disease IgM will be elevated for from day 5 of the symptoms up to 8 weeks and then if somebody has a IgG that means that they're immune okay so this usual is an exam question okay in the IgM when is it elevated fee and rubella okay well another exam question is you can isolate it from the urine they will give you examples on whether you can isolate the virus from so in the rubella you can isolate it from the urine so this is the congenital rubella triad it's cataract cardiac abnormality and deafness and this is the rash and usually it's called the blueberry - a blueberry in who were a to tell Israel so malicious or amahi what activists if they were truthful careful al rash there no Gaetano KATUSA leader he Ikeda Lorna had to be cool Allah morph atomic benefic Rami so hard else triad it's a very important right to know I'll try out of congenital rubella infection congenital infection they can present the Bansal I'm on condition for cataract while I'm on can't issue for congenital glaucoma Phil Hartman Kelly cone and the home hating ductus arteriosus Walla pulmonary artery stenosis monkian hepatosplenomegaly jaundice Monken tissue for in the home retinopathy is drawn between so Lehrer between and AHA microcephaly Bakunin dome developmental delay mental retardation and meningeal encephalitis we can end the home neonatal purpura Bakunin end home deafness while al vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy which of the following is the most common entry line infection rubella HSV cytomegalovirus will adversely lobster virus the man and most common in trailer an infection is the cytomegalovirus it accounts for 0.2 to 2% of all unit and infection transmission usually is either by direct contact all body fluids and by vertical transmission or from breastfeeding so any woman that has cytomegalovirus breastfeeding is contraindicated in this virus Pardo had the diamonds to honest alone a fethullah combination viruses ellaby cone al breastfeeding contraindicated feeha become diamond hotel cytomegalovirus our HIV 85% r0 positive risk of infection is zero negative and one to four percent most common it's the most common cause of sensory your chronal deafness okay heard about the Domenici boo mcq which of the following is the most common cause of sensory neuron or deafness illa huwa a cytomegalovirus and manifestation most common become asymptomatic about seventy to eighty percent forty percent of cases will have primary infection and one percent only will have secondary infection they present with flu-like symptoms Lihua arthralgia arthritis fever low-grade fever malaise willfully immuno suppressed they can present with hepatitis or myocarditis meningitis they can present as well with it or meningeal encephalitis a congenital infection usually the baby will present with will have either IUGR or anemia microcephaly thrombocytopenia cranial calcifications Coromant rightists sensorineural deafness most are asymptomatic at birth and then they develop disability and psychomotor hearing loss and neurological defects numbers that you need to know 80% are asymptomatic at birth fifteen to twenty percent will have sensor neuronal deafness 15 to 20 percent are symptomatic and twenty to thirty percent die from infection or liver disease the diagnosis is a little bit complicated so in this in the CMV you need to do the IgG and the IgM type and you have to check for the avidity okay so if the IgG is negative and the IgM is negative then obviously there's no infection if the IgG is positive and the IgM is positive with low ability so this means that this is a primary CMV and you have to do invasive testing invasive testings they actually who are either courtesan pieces will amniocentesis depending Allah what gestational age it was diagnosed if the IgG is positive was high avidity and the IgM is negative then this is a latent infection and you don't need further treatment so if you're uncertain of the serology then then you can proceed to invasive testing if you have an IgG positive with high ability and IgM positive then this is a recurrent and no invasive follow-up is needed so testing the gold standard is immunity fluid nucleic acid amplification test ultrasound you will usually find intracranial calcification if eugenic bowel while adventure chemically so that's for the CMV fee is a Leland and ahem el parvo virus it's a single-stranded DNA virus the cone transmitted by respiratory droplet willable Transfer Center fifty to fifty six percent of women are immune one to three percent of women are susceptible in pregnancy al presentation twenty to thirty percent are asymptomatic eighty percent present with arthropathy Flula symptoms and four days later the rush starts myocarditis they can present with aplastic crisis anemia and immunocompromised al parvo virus a little slap cheek disease - I think F kennel baby I had a lot to Chicago for John hammer come on mom can I so we hydrops type for had anesthesia had confit intrauterine a transmission is 17 to 33 percent it can cause spontaneous abortion if less than 20 weeks the rate is 14 percent or after 20 weeks it's about 2% high drop stop and become from 8 to 10 percent serology IgM appears after 2 to 3 days of the acute infection and pre cysts up to 6 months IgG appears after few days of the IgM and resist fertilized metal fetus if that is a we i GM are 22 weeks at about though so I am sick you type so to understand the serology Huggle parvo virus if you have an IgG positive and an IgM negative that means that this woman is immune or had so illaha reassurance oh she doesn't need to worry if she is IgG positive or negative and the IgM is positive then this means that this is a recent infection you need to do ultrasound for hydrops transfer to MFM if no hydrops then you have to repeat the ultrasound between 8 to 12 weeks and in some books they say that you have to repeat the ultrasound weekly for 8 to 12 weeks if you have an IgG negative and an IgM negative then this means that this patient is non-immune and you need to counsel the station okay so which is not a blood-borne infection salmonella listeria toxoplasmosis syphilis time is slightly labarda Henare if mean who talks to plasmosis transmission increases with increased gestational age fill first trimester bakunin transmission 10 to 20 percent in the second trimester it's 25 to 30 percent third trimester it's about 60 percent so transmission usually is due to uncooked raw meat cat faeces exposure that is infected with the outsides of the toe of the tox applause or mechanical illegal transmission transparently 90 percent usually are asymptomatic incubation period is about 5 to 18 days the IgM appears five days after exposure IgG appears one to two weeks after the exposure and peaks at six months the serology to understand it so if you have an IgG and an IgM negative so this means that there is no infection or extremely new player Blandon IgG will i GM sale of illegal AHA and no map to play a local fish Hallet and toxin if you have an IgG positive and an IgM negative so this means that this is a prior infection if you have an IgG positive and an IgM positive so this means that this is a recent acute infection so indications to do Avenue in this case in cases of toxoplasmosis so if this is a maternal primary infection you can't confirm or exclude primary infection or if you have ultrasound features ultrasound features like choreo and try this calcification treatment and then a live or maternal infection usually when there's a maternal infection you're gonna give her her spider my son one gram P o every eight hours until delivery okay if you have a feet on infection then you're gonna give them the Pyramus amine and the self as self azzedine it decreases the severity of fatal infection to prevent the toxoplasmosis from happening you have to cook the meat wash the fruits and veggies clean the surface areas that you're using either to cut or shop the fruits and vegetables freeze the meat change the litter with gloves janna lima bean mrs. lemon is a hero allahu wa al tropical vista you have to use gloves and always keeps the cats indoors for the search list we said the causative organism is the Treponema pallidum transmission usually is either by intercourse placenta blood vertical transmission one absolutely hua trunks the symptom incubation period become from three weeks to 90 days the risk factors usually is substance abuse drug abuse HIV treatment failure reinfection somebody has no prenatal care multiple sexual partners voila and he WA a prostitute early stage transmission usually is 30 to 50 percent usually they have a primary painless Shanker secondary by kun and the home condyloma lotta felt palms and planters early latent reactive monkey near Qom primary and secondary while a Bakunin delayed late stage transmission and this is variable in the primary Bakunin the home painless Shanker raised red areas and involves the lymph nodes and usually it resolves after two to eight weeks the secondary become multi-system condyloma lotta be corn it affects the palmar and the planters bakunin the hemella brush and constitutional symptoms diagnosis usually diagnosis usually with dark field microscopy direct fluorescent antibody testing VDRL rapid plasma regain test confirmatory test beacon will first and troponin antibody absorption test micro hemagglutination assay for antibodies and Aminu for TCR alice royal diamond is abou what is the test table on had the dark field microscopy what is the diagnosis cephalus had

it poppin it hits a good but I don't know if I would get this again I would probably just stick to uh yeah there's a seal but I would probably just stick to uh dang faves but that's just my opinion the packaging was really nice though I just don't get as big a clouds as I do with that the bang babes [Music] you got to really try to hit it and that's not what I don't like but for 35 bucks it's not bad still looks really human it still gets me high well yeah I guess that's all I have to say about it [ __ ]", "t8UNGYfxmsM": "pal what's up YouTube this is Don down at lid and we got a show or a deal for you today we call it the CBD starter pack this is a heck of a deal actually then I'm gonna be showing you here we got our evolve plus pretty basic pin it's got a dual quartz coil it's got the cap to stop the stuff from using out the top when it gets hot it's got the dual quartz coils these guys are pretty awesome it's perfect for our CBDs which I'll be explaining in a second we got it's got a a you micro USB easy to charge it's got a cool detachable slick here so you keep your materials in here perfect to take it on any trips with you it's good to take it because it's completely portable you don't need a rig you don't have to have a rig this way you can just take it around with you and dab on the go and it comes with an extra coil here it also comes with a charger and a little tool here and what we've been doing with these lately as we've been taking the CBD DAV's CBD rock tabs these are normally 50 for the G these are have a food grade terpene they give it the flavor of a traditional strand but it's 100% no THC as a hint derived so it's completely illegal in all 50 states it's a good option because it gives a lot of the the medical and the body effects of marijuana but without the THC so there's no head change to it and it's a really good option for those who can't smoke or who you know need to pass a drug test or or have a trouble getting through drug programs and stuff it's a good option because the CBD dabs with the food grade terpene kind of give it the traditional flavor so you can still love it we have a bunch of different flavors right here you can see this is blue cheese it's pretty popular really popular actually we have some other strands like white widow pineapple Express we have Tigers blood Charlie Sheen we have gelato Applejack I've got Northern Lights right here and that's actually what I'm putting in my pin today so this is what you get you get the Evolve plus and then the gram of dabs you get both of these things from with $75 and the best thing about it is you do not have to come in here to get it we can ship it to you for $75 and I'm going to show you how it works here's mine same color and everything evolve plus everybody in the store everybody that works here actually has one and they use it for the CBD is because it has a low tip so you don't have to worry about the hints being harsh you get a lot of that terpene flavor so pretty much you just have it like this and you take some of this Northern Lights here you don't want to do too much because there's little holes in it so if you do too much it could bubble up and crystallize inside that hole and it eventually makes it harder to hit but if you just drop a little rock like that yeah take it like this and you drop it in here like so and then you put on your cap screw it on like that and then you hit it oh hell yeah do the flavor of that Northern Lights is incredible Wow let's do another one it's good it's awesome you get the CBD effects all the body parts of it in a portable little device here and you can take it on the go it's a perfect way to try it so you're not forking over hundreds of dollars for a rig and a nail and the torch and

oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these

distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't

American television and radio the People's Choice for community program welcome to my kitchen in today's show I'll be making three new recipes from my new cookbook a baking journey I'll be making lemon coconut macaroon sesame leaves cookies and sliced almonds sweetness we'll start off by making lemon coconut macaroons for this recipe I need four egg whites will crack him in the ball just in case it's as real simple recipe to make only few ingredients it doesn't require that much time to prepare or to because until floppy to this I'll add 1/3 cup of granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to this I'll add zest of one whole lemon love using zest of lemon it has all the intense flavor more actually than the juice of the lemon or the lemon by itself so this will give this recipe a really nice great flavor a good combination coconut with lemon zest now I will add three cups of sweetened coconut flakes you notice that we didn't use that much sugar because the coconut is already sweeter that's three cups of coconut to the mixture we'll mix everything together until well incorporated now I have mini cupcakes as 24 of them and I'm gonna line them with paper liner it's always easier to have the paper liners and my cupcake pan you don't have to spray them or you don't have to use any other liners to do mini cupcakes actually now what I would do is I will maybe use about one teaspoon for each mini cupcake I will divide this whole mixture in between 24 of them you see the lemon zest and the mixture I wish you can smell that smells so so good love love the lemon zest in baking really enhance the flavor of anything that you make like I said this is real easy recipe and it's great springtime now I will add one whole element on top of each one of them I'm using roll all almond while baking them in the oven the almonds will be all roasted them so there is no need to use roasted almonds certainly a great combination coconut with almonds spirit a look at very rich cookie our cookies are ready to go on the oven to bake I have my oven preheated to 350 degrees we'll bake the cookies in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown check on our cookies given in the oven for 15 minutes you would have all this mal wonderful it's amazing how good the lemon zest with the coconut smells really really good and I'll set them aside to cool off now we'll transfer our cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely set them aside to cool completely until we are ready to serve now I'm ready to make sesame glazed cookies my favorite favorite a real nice and delicate and they are delicious to this I'm gonna grate or actually get a zest of one orange and set it on the side I need to get three two tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice so I will get the zest first it's easier to squeeze the juice out of the orange I'll set the pharmacist on the side now I will get two tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice measure two tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice perfect I'll add 3 tablespoons of honey this is very very unique recipe the combination of all these ingredients together will give you an amazing cookies the honey and now I'll add three tablespoons of butter and then one cup of powdered sugar I placed the heavy saucepan on medium to high heat we'll give it a quick stir wanna make sure the sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted and everything it's melted together and it's gonna create a nice mixture thick and syrupy mixture actually we're just gonna bring it to a boil that's all we don't want to cook it we're gonna finish cooking these cookies in the oven so as soon as everything comes to boil now the butter is melted the sugar is melted I will turn the stove off set it on the side for one minute one to two minutes actually just to cool off slightly before I add the flour and the sesame seeds now to this one cup of sesame seeds I'm using pale golden sesame seeds if you'd like to use black seeds you can use that too or you can use a mixture of black sesame seeds and regular sesame seeds and then 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour and the orange zests that we just created here it's this is these are the only ingredients I need to use for these cookies and it is an amazing combination they heavenly good cookies everyone's favorite I wish you can smell the orange zest and the honey now the mixture is ready everything is nicely blended with each other and the mixture is ready we set it for a minute or so to cool off slightly now we are ready to bake the cookies all what I need is to drop about one teaspoon full of the mixture baking sheet lined with parchment paper about four to five inches apart because you'll see once they bake they can spread and we want to make sure we need enough space and between them and you see I'm only using a little bit of the mixture you'll see why when I start baking them I have my oven preheated to 350 degrees we'll bake these cookies in the oven for five to seven minutes only does not take longer than that check the cookies they only been in the oven for six minutes and look how much they spread we only use one teaspoon and look how beautiful and caramelized they are and I wish you can smell they are amazing and we'll set them aside to cool off for two to three minutes now the cookies are cold enough to remove them from the parchment paper and we're gonna set down a coal Greg to cool off and to harden a little bit look how beautiful they are that's why they are called laced cookies because they have all this lace effect onam and this is all happening because of the caramelization of the sugar and the honey and the butter and that's why they have all these shapes and not two are alike because of the way that they separate when they are cooking each one is different size different shape which is okay they all gonna taste as good you can serve these cookies flat like that or what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a mold that's gonna look like a cup so I'll drape them over this Lumpkin and press the sides down and it's gonna look like a cop it's nice to say ice cream in it you have to work real fast because they harden so quickly and if you think they are already too stiff to mold you can just take them to the oven for about 30 seconds and to rewarm and they'll be more flexible after work quickly so they won't harden and press them down so you can give them that effect to create a nice ball you can serve ice-cream Odom whooping cream pudding or even just fresh fruits they stack up so nicely on top of each other and they are very very delicate so you want to be careful handling them this one lady and this one is ready also instead of draping the cookies on the Lumpkins you can just place them inside and press against the walls of the ramekin to create a cup design so you can drape them over the Lumpkin or you can just place them inside the ramekin and this will give you the same effect almost so whatever it's easier for you now I'm ready to make the slight almond sweet me for this recipe I need one stick have a cup of unsalted water try to cut it in about half an inch to 3/4 of an inch slices go in the sauce pan using heavy-bottomed saucepan to make this syrup and one of light corn syrup this recipe has only four ingredients all together it sounds simple to make and then we'll place it on medium to high heat bring the mixture to boil let me make sure that sugar is dissolve and the butter is melted so we'll give it a nice stir and then we'll let it cook insert a thermometer in there let that cook until the candy thermometer reaches 240 degrees just wait until the candy thermometer register 240 degrees it's almost there it's very important to use the candy thermometer because you want to make sure it should be at the right temperature so you will not end up with very hard sweet meat or real soft so using the candy thermometer is very very important now mixture reach 240 degree I have six cups of sliced almonds in here I'll pour the mixture on top of the sliced almonds and then we'll mix everything together until well incorporated and everything it's nicely blended together and all the almonds are coated with the syrup you want to work real fast because the mixture hardens so fast I have brushed a tray with I lined it with parchment paper and increase the linemen the parchment paper also I was fond this whole mixture into the prepared pan will separate the mixture into an even lawyer and to the to the lawyer and to have an even higher now the mixture is nice and smooth how beautiful looks you can have to leave it for maybe about 20 to 30 minutes to colossal but before we slice them into diamond shapes now we are ready just like sweet me first of all I'll cut it into six strips about an inch you know I'll cut these strips into diamond shapes you can also cut them into square shape or maybe are you like I'd like the diamond shape it gives it a nice effect a lot of cool off for maybe 15 minutes or so this is how much time we have for today and today sure I need three new recipes for my new cookbook a baking journey I made sesame lace cookies slight almonds sweet meat and

that's how I am right now that's the realest we know [ __ ] you know bull all right till you die", "bT3NnQKZOS4": "hi this is Ryan happy healthy meeting this episode I'm going to be doing something I've been wanting to do for a really long time I'm going to compare bananas and I want to compare rice and see which one is a better deal as far as how many calories I can get for a dollar that's some we all want to know like you know we know that a raw diet can be instead to be kind of expensive and one reason for eating raw till 4 or more grains or starch is that you might be able to save a little money so I want to test this out I have no idea so what I did is um here's my forty pound box of bananas I get from Whole Foods it's organic whole trade and I like those compared to non whole trade and conventional bananas which I know a lot of my friends get at the warehouses for like 15 bucks but we've seen those documentaries and I'm not going to mention which corporations aren't they spray though their bananas with gnarly chemicals they don't really care about the product they care less about their workers because the workers come down with illnesses and these corporations deny all responsibility so I want to support that one good clean food going on my body so I get these babies forty pounds organic and I'm going to compare that versus right so again I want to get some good rice I don't want to get some crappy rice can get me sick this is organic brown rice from California from this diamond brand I get this at the local um um ranch ninety nine market it's a West Coast chain primarily it's an Asian a Chinese market and have a great selection of rice and I love this I got this fifteen pound bag for $7.98 what I did next is I went to Kurama tur that nutrition website where you can figure out all the you know the calories and nutrients for any food punched in 40 pounds bananas and got over 16,000 100 calories total for a forty pound box not too shabby huh and for this rice I just got the nutrition information off the back and calculated four of the whole 15 pound bag there's over 24,000 calories in this bag Wow really not shabby about twenty four thousand three hundred odd calories so the next thing I did was I took that total amount of calories and divided it by the price so I that way I would be able to get how many calories per dollar there were each of these foods so for the bananas it worked out to be 453 calories per dollar so for every dollar you're getting 453 calories you know eight um two dollars with a food 900 calories so bananas are a great value and that's why I think they're the king of all fruits because tell me any other fruit and get so many calories for so cheap you know banana island kind of living well for the rice again I punched in the numbers and it turned out to be let me look at my some notes here remember bananas are 453 calories per dollar the rice turned out to be over 3,000 calories per dollar 24,000 360 calories / $7.98 that's 3053 calories per dollar so in theory guys one dollar a day will get you three thousand calories you can live off a dollar a day now you see why so many you know developing nations where people just make a couple dollars a day they live off rice where else you know what other food can you just have Leon live off for a dollar day that's one a big bowl rice sprinkle maybe a little veggies or something like that on top and they're done they got their calories so I I think um now I've shown myself and now you guys if you're trying to stretch your budget if you have a having a tough stretch of luck right there with your finances rice is the way to go 3,000 calories per dollar versus 453 calories per dog doesn't mean I'm not gonna eat bananas ever again no how do I know all the time but I just you know now I'm showing that rice is a great alternative to stretch a budget or something to use during really hard times you just want to spend a dollar a day on food all right so I'm let me know what you think down below what do you think of this experiment you know it has proven anything to you getting more rice now I just didn't keep eating as I do you know eat bananas and fruit all day little rice and some at night a great way to live so post down below and fee I'm all ready to sprout up above for more from happy healthy vegan so until next time guys I'm gonna do here obviously with honor food keep it car baby even card true Yoshiki this", "r-1OidWBKLg": "I'm gonna do a little video here one show everybody that's kind of fun a real thing I think got this shatter here dabble extracts there and it came in one of these containers as fancy packaging I was like man somebody could easily make this little setup look like some diamond so figured well let's go what the heck let's do it so I broke you all up each a little chunk there and then I have this syringe here of the list distillate and I'm going to pour it on to it and hopefully it look sexy chirps and diamonds I just wanted to open this here I want everybody to see exactly how this starts off looking so you can kind of see okay [Applause] right there busted it up it looks like about that and now everybody looky here well we got a we got what looks like to me some turps and diamonds and you know what people would think yeah it's kind of reversed it's what you call reverse diamonds you got clear Terps and colored THC pretty funny tell me what you think I think it was cool little concept to do cool I'm gonna", "4dD9gVbMQbw": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene I've got a little bit of a different set up today so we're just trying out a couple of new things on the channel I've also got a lovely extract that I want to show you this is petroleum berry diamonds and sauce it is by gas leak extracts and it is an example of some really nice cannabis extract join me as we take a look at the gas leak extracts petroleum berry diamonds and sauce if you've been watching the channel for a while you'll know that we cover strains extracts and anything cannabis related if you want to know more about Debian or extracts or anything like that go and check out our previous videos where we actually do inform people about the stabbing process this is a cross of mother of all berries and Yeti OG so it's gonna be in de Kalinin Moab by th seeds crosses a couple of strains on the indica sides the Yeti OG is oh gee cush crossed with Sour Diesel just want to say a big up to cash and gas leak extracts let us look at the petroleum bearish straight away you can see some really nice diamond formation in this extract looks absolutely delicious there's also a nice balance and ratio of diamonds to source the diamonds are the THC a crystals and the sauce is that deliciously volatile turfy tasty cannabis extract there's got all of those tips readily available so when you mix them together and dab them together in this product you get a really really nice flavor profile the coloration it's like a lovely golden yellow with the white faceted diamonds just mixed in there and it is looking absolutely lovely let's talk about how it smells getting that sort of slight OG sort of piney sort of classic sort of flavor coming out of this or aroma coming out of this not overpowering but it is clearly they're giving that deliciously Turkey smell to it and as far as extract go it's quite nice and quite strong-smelling for an extract this sort of fruity coffee star Winokur isn't coming through as much as the yeti oh geez sort of high levels of gas that is what I'm experiencing more when it comes to the aroma of this extract let us see how it tastes today we have got the Brighton glass alien number two rigged check him out this is gonna be helping me to experience the petroleum berries in the right way I've also managed to download myself a dab app from the Android App Store just search for dab time and it comes up you can set your own time I've got 25 seconds heat up 60 seconds cool down and it even gives me a little warning and changes color when it's time to stop hating it up etc so now we've heated up the debris we've got a 1 minute cooldown time during which we will be preparing our dab there we go so on the dab so we've got this lovely delicious diamond and sauce mixture the lovely extract is sitting on the devtool there waiting to go if you're joining me for this one you know what to do get those joints rolled bombs ready dab rigs heated up hit that pulse button if you need to I'm about to go live with a dab of petroleum Barry by gas leak extracts and I'll see you guys on the other side Cheers [Music] Wow so I'm getting the delicious Oh G type flavor it's got hints of the fruity notes but not as much much more on the og on the yet side to me that one very very gassy very very sort of classic algae on steroids almost in your face or in your mouth after hitting that dab it tastes bloody lovely as far as the dabbing experience goes quite a smooth dabbing experience had a little bit of a wheeze in my chest anyway after I coughed it up there was no acridity no need to be coughing and yeah generally really enjoyed that dab in fact so much so that we're gonna do another one here we go and the alien debris has got a name is called woodsy purchased him at Bora fest 2018 from Brighton glass would see the alien that our first dab on would see in the would set orifice another dab ready petroleum buried diamonds and saw newer tech when it comes to the diamonds and sauce the THC a diamonds are actually it's very very strong almost pure if not pure THC let's bat it and I'll see you all on the other side cheers folks [Music] there is a delicious form of extract it's a delicious strain and it has been done really really well let's talk about the effects of the petroleum berry cannabis extracts obviously stronger than your traditional forms of cannabis and the Diamonds and sauce does take it to the next level we're talking 99.9% pure THC with the THC a crystals plus the source which also has cannabinoids in it so there is a lot of cannabinoids in diamonds and sorts even when compared to other forms of cannabis extract so I'm feeling a relaxed chilled out body stone which is kicking in nicely I'm actually standing up as you can see at the moment so a bit of a different set in we're trying something new where the videos got the green screen behind me which is even going to look really good or really bad depending on depending on my skills with it in editing feeling a nice body stone washing over my body I can notice the light sensitivity it does feel like it's strong but also I just feel like and relaxed sort of not as chatty although I guess the sour DS so I just still gonna be chassis in there not over overpowering some extract I'm dabbing at the moment it's like knocking me out after a single dad not that level of overpowering but the Yeti og high and the Moab high are both really really good so mixing them together and I could just feel it now those those waves just washing relaxing chilling out body high feeling nice in the body that sort of thing it's just washing over me right now so so yeah very very nice in terms of the effects guys let's sum things up today we've been dabbing the petroleum berry by gas leak extract and wow that has been a wicked extractor feature in one of our videos terms of the appearance it looked lovely it smelt delicious it tasted and dabbed wonderfully and the effects are also very nice as well so overall this is getting really high marks in our review and yeah I am feeling like I'm gonna go relaxed gonna go sit now what do you think of petroleum Barry what do you think of the new review style guys do leave your comments below and I'll be reading those and catching up with you in another video very very soon remember if you like our content to hit that

what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with special guest justin cures what's good doing a west coast we tour review featuring the buddies brand forbidden skittles liquid diamond live resin one gram baked cartridge i'm excited we've got a buddy's brand vape battery it's going to be an exciting time now the cool thing about this particular west coast we tour review is that justin's review his score is going to be the official review score for buddy's brand why i work for buddy's brand so to be fair and unbiased you're up i need you to be extra tough you're on camera always honest with you i know you're always honest stay honest okay i'm not paying you there's no money right now i've given it's a 6.5 all right here we go but be honest so what we're working with here is the one gram cartridge see we got a buddy see cell cartridge 76.7 on the total cannabinoids thc 74.61 terpenes are always listed right so buddies greenbox terpenes are always listed on the back we've got eight point two one percent on the total terpenes we've got three terps always displayed which terpenes do we have this beta caryophyllene limonene in eight yep yep which is from hops i think this is going to get me this is going to bring like that stoned uh that's like the one word that one word i think i'm like really that's gonna get slightly 8.2 woody yeah it's going to be good 76.7 total contaminants with our cartridges i always recommend a four to six long like vapor rip you if you have a battery that can change temperatures put it on the first like lowest temperature setting or the second the second lowest and you're generally pretty solid if you have a battery like this one that just pulls then four to six seconds should do you just fine if it doesn't if you pull it and your battery doesn't like do anything then consider changing out your battery that's how you can really tell it's that real deal live resin liquid full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub-critical temperatures are you ready this is real live resin nothing but no atoms this is that low temp life right here five seconds no blinkers only type of [ __ ] you don't want to do a blinker and burn at all yeah don't burn the terps all right let's see i love it clouds right there see what i was saying oh i get that taste that skittles are right off the bat man that's bomb that's really smooth really smooth probably one of the smoothest uh live residence panda i've never tried it usually sometimes i'll get like uh which one we'll call which is harshness in the background right like super citrusy vapes tend to be kind of harsh sometimes right because it's so like potent or powerful tasting right right this is the key word really is smooth light there's a piney gassiness in there like the turks kind of roast the nostrils right but then that when you finally exhale it out you get a slight citrus just like anyone you know i'm really i'm really getting the uh uh um the humeline and the karyophiline coming through because when i was blowing it out it's almost like it's like a it's like a um like a cider almost yeah it's like a right it's like a earthy cider citrusy earthy and then the woodiness yeah i really like the color i really like the taste i really like the flavor um i mean everything speaks for itself like everything is the high letting you know what it is uh right off the bat seeing the terpene profile i'm like okay this is gonna get me stoned this first hit i feel uh i feel like calm i kind of feel it in my legs a little bit what do you feel and i feel uh that indica high like you're where you get it behind the eyes you know and already making money what do you feel like behind the pressure in your eyes because that's what i'm really getting right now is just like i want a homing sensation i want to squint and i'm also like you almost could just go to sleep just puffing on this bin it tastes really really good and the high is immediate in terms of both the body feel and like a slight burst of energy as well get it out the nose just to get just to get more of those major curves and that's how i kind of like you know if that if that really like is a burning sensation sometimes i'm a little iffy on the pen that's why i was saying this one's really smooth no harshness even with that i'm not even no no phasing over here and i'm i'm stoned presentation appeal i'll think consider all these things right now okay there's a number out there i want you to marinate on it presentation appeal the color the taste the smell you can smell the turkey you want to get stone buy this banana potency more information available would you recommend it overall what are you thinking i'm thinking i would recommend this especially this strain like i would say go find this because uh two hits and i feel like i took a dab yeah two doc feel like i feel like i took a dab nice dad you know um and that's hard from from a pen to give you that such a head change so that's like really upping the score for me um and then also i like i said i really like the color on it um yeah this packaging's there your major terps you letting me know the potency uh doesn't really show me anything on cbd but that's okay that's not everything that says that happens um but you're showing total cannabinoids and that's what matters that's what matters so overall i'm gonna give this a nine a solid nine i think what would be missing is just maybe more i need to do that well that's what i was going to say just more of the information on on what like this specific strain is going to do to me what it's about and that would be it that would be it i mean everything else is is letting me know this is this [ __ ] is what it is it's fire yeah that's what the color the color is come on come on that's consistent right there so but uh i know you guys you all heard it here and also from the rosin head himself fresh as well yeah this is this is our newest drop really good solid night i tried to bring i tried to bring some the buddies maybe maybe throw some more info on there it doesn't hurt people want to know i want to know you know what's up with this strain and that's about it other than the terps you guys are hitting on t nine club well very much appreciate the honesty man and the transparency on

one of the least favorites of the last five quarters i got um and this was the one that had no keith in the jar when i first got it but now that i look in it it's like full of that keef again but we'll dump some out we're gonna bust it up see what it is it was a little dry it was on sale on the low for like i don't even know i think it was 70 bucks or something there's really not much of a smell to it uh and there was only one seed that i found in it so i mean i don't complain when i find just one seed that's not that's not the worst thing that could happen but boom that's what it looks like untrimmed it wasn't the best it was uh it's super dry i mean like i said it was only 70 dollars it was on sale so i grabbed it um i'm not a crazy fan of spending all kind of money on flour so i just went with a good old alera and i just figured i don't know they've been doing such great jobs with their [ __ ] that i don't mind their flyer i mean it's dry but look still sticks of your hand like crazy um yeah not a bad looking but but like i said it was the least favorite of my um [Music] out of all these quarters i grew up uh like the past month there was like five quarters and this one here i think it's the least favorite but we're gonna go and do a dab real quick i just want to show you this flower um [Music] i actually haven't smoked this in a while sunday driver g-league pocket might as well just finish you're up i guess whoa this apoca almost went for a rod and it's early everybody on this [ __ ] oh [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] gotta get up ho ho ho my [ __ ] christmas is coming

up north dhs is a package oh i got a package with a signature cool you guys [ __ ] rock have a great day christmas is coming", "rEwwGUg7IR0": "all right y'all i know this is a weird angle but i don't have my my gimbal is not working i mean it's working but i gotta charge it and i can't wait to make this video anymore because i'm about to finish this card so let's get straight to the video man today we're gonna be reviewing the live resin liquid diamond live resin buddies cartridge man so this cartridge was forty dollars out the door this is gonna be a full gram cartridge um the strain is gonna be sapphire og and triangle kush box first this is what the box is going to be looking like a nice mint colored box is going to be sapphire og and triangle kush it's going to be a low thc percentage at 69 cec but i will say that thc percentage has nothing to do with how hard it hits because it's one of the better cards that i've had um there's going to be indica dominant or straight indica i love my indicas um in the goods and higher bridges are my favorite sativas i like every now and then but indicators are going to be my favorite there's gonna be no cbd 72 percent total cannabinoids like i said liquid diamonds like resin um i was expecting the liquid to be darker but it's actually pretty clear and you could tell it's not distillate because of the leftover that's on the glass it looks like live resin you know like it looks like sauce or something and there's like little bits that are just hanging and stuff i don't know you could just tell this liquid looks different the consistency of this liquid is is not like a raw garden that has some clear ass supposedly light resin and it was just this the lip this is going to be the side right here you guys want to pause and read that this is the back gives you a lot of information in the back a lot of [ __ ] i don't even like i don't know what none of this stuff is here i just know what you know the tfc percentage is there's something cool about this i mean it's not like cool but something that i noticed most companies will put in hell for two to three seconds here it puts inhale until the desired effect is achieved that's pretty like you know that's something slick that you could add to your to your box these are all the terpene profiles uh what makes some like the natural terpene so what you guys don't know terpenes are just taste there's terpenes and everything i'm pretty sure there's you know terpenes in this gatorade disturbance in there so the way you open this just from the top there's gonna be a cart in there a clear box i mean and this is what the car is going to be looking like i've today's monday i've had this since friday i've been using it a good amount um i will say that it did go by a bit quicker than i wanted it to uh i don't know what i say is worth it though i got it for 40 bucks it's cool you know what i'm saying like for the price i just like if it was like 30 35 bucks it'll make more sense to me i'm pretty sure the distillate ones are like 30 35 bucks but i don't know i'm just like i expected it to be a lot more crazy you told me like this just kind of reminds me like a boy i don't know reminds me like almost i don't know man one thing i will say about this though the flavor is different i haven't tasted really any cartridges like this this is a unique taste i really like the sapphire og and triangle kush recommend this one if you guys haven't had buddies in general all right y'all so i'm gonna just put it in the battery for y'all take a hit and um so you guys can see what it's hitting like it should it hits cool you feel me um for flavor i'm gonna have to give it like an eight out of ten for the high like eight out of ten overcard is like a eight out of ten you feel me it's cool you feel me like it's not you know nothing crazy let me take a blinker for y'all [Music] it is a really [ __ ] smooth car though i will give it that um i'll say smoother than a hotter cartridge i said i'd say this is probably one of the smoothest cards i've had um like you guys saw it's like a blinker still able to talk after and all that so i don't know i don't know how i feel about this i'll give it like an eight out of ten filming i think that's like a solid score for this um nothing too crazy uh it's not the worst but if you haven't tried it i would for sure try them out just because the flavor is so unique on them haven't really had anything like them and uh yeah man so like i said i got this for forty dollars out the door um this is gonna be the liquid diamond one i believe buddies does also make a distillate one that one was probably like thirty dollars out the door i have to ask um i have to ask if they have the distilled ones maybe i'll get one and i know they have some cbd thc ones but i don't i don't like that [ __ ] show me i just like straight tvc cbd is cool should be cool for like uh syrup edibles and [ __ ] like that but straight up tastes like you're taking a dab i wouldn't say a weed i'll say more like taking this like it tastes like diamonds bro for real for real that's what it is bro it tastes like [ __ ] diamonds they're not capping about that liquid liquid diamond [ __ ] yeah it should taste like diamonds because i just had some diamonds you guys haven't seen in the video uploaded right before this one i believe it's the king's garden one tastes just like it bro what the [ __ ] yeah that's what it is man this should taste like straight diamonds you guys had diamonds before actual dish that's what this [ __ ] tastes like i don't know what number this is number one hopefully y'all enjoy the video hopefully i taught y'all some hopefully i learned something hopefully i inspired y'all to go get this hopefully i got lit with me man and i'll catch you in the next one peace", "lCWkyvWgIpk": "wacks liquidiser has revolutionized the vaping and cannabis industry by introducing a product that

the hype about this anyway what makes this car better than my TKO or dang baby not to burst your bubble those are fake carts and I'll do a video on fake carts soon this is a cart that I bought at a licensed dispensary here in Massachusetts this half grams co2 extract cart will run you roughly fifty dollars now you might be thinking why the hell would I pay fifty dollars for a half gram when I can go get a full gram for maybe $30 on the street let me tell you these carts are lab tested they only contain cannabis oil and natural terpenes this is a peer of Wax cart without any additives or cutting agents they have been tested for vitamin E acetate which if you don't know what that is already that's the main ingredient that's making people sick off the street carts it's a cutting agent so that dealers can sell less cannabis for greater profit but enough about that let's talk about this car is it really worth the $50 and in my opinion hell yes it is I know that when I'm smoking this car I'm only inhaling pure cannabis and natural terpenes nothing else that's gonna make me sick put holes in my lungs or affect my future health this strain is taste of rainbows it's got roughly about 82% THC and 0% CBD in it I hope you guys learned a little bit more from this video I know I was very short and it was to the point I hope you learned a little bit about fake cards real cards what the difference is between the two and I hope that you guys can appreciate what's put into making these cards real and making these cards clean and safe for you to consume I'll see you guys on the next video peace out you [Music]", "uUrKebIn4Vw": "[Music] what's a guy simplistic here back with another video and I am just going to be smoking in this video today and whatever we talk about we talk about you know I'm saying but I am running out of wax though so we're going to the smoke the rest of my NRC wax I've made a video on it already you probably seen by now but yeah I mean just just a quick session let me see if we can we can do a light hotbox or a little chill a little hotbox you know I'm saying I don't have too much hot boxes on this new channel so it's probably because I'm one man and I can't really hotbox things by myself because it takes a lot of lung power for that but I'm going to try for you so we're gonna try and attempt a hot box with wax I guess but you know NRC you guys know very very good stuff I bought this around Monday last week so about one week this has blasted me or I might have bought on Wednesday plastic sure like you go to the club so many times you don't know what day you win anymore you know so this is how much I have left a bit I definitely need some more so we're gonna finish this in this video and probably just be a little chill session just the update on my channel and stuff I mean we've been doing we've been going good got merch now you know finally you know I had to go through two channels or three channels to find the unleash merch or unlock unleash like it's a [ __ ] pet or something but to unlock reveal merch I guess or cut out merch I don't [ __ ] know what the term is but yeah and it's a it's pretty satisfying though wearing your own [ __ ] but nothing about the merchants I've been mentioning it and you probably [ __ ] sing a bit but we're smoking [Music] so we're gonna split this up into two hits [Music] let me know what you guys are smoking on I haven't passed that in a while and that's used to ask that like every [ __ ] video now sometimes I get sidetracked on there's never like just cuz I say something all the time in the video does that mean I'll say it in the next video you know it's just whatever comes to mind you know I always start the video with back with another video I don't know why it's [ __ ] I'm not talking [ __ ] about myself as you but yeah or like if you couldn't tell from the title but it's like you know people people always say like what the title is in the beginning a little in the video but you guys are ready you know so it's like why should I repeat what you just read you know I don't know why I [ __ ] say the things that I say but whatever sure is [Music] and things been going good like I said I've released the merch I [ __ ] uh have been doing videos constantly hopefully you guys can appreciate the the commitment to the craft you know I'm not saying that I have the best videos in the world by I do have that persistence to keep on going and the persistence to keep on bettering myself with each video you know that doesn't mean like there's some videos that are lacking you know sometimes videos don't need to be edited as much as some other videos you know like vlogs they have to be edited like I'll make sure to have some sort of musical clip in between that vlog at least somewhere in there whether it be twice or three times or whatever or just once but at least that you know some of these product reviews and these wax reviews I really need too much of an intro or musical intro for this sometimes I just started with the title and it's just what I feel on that day and hopefully you guys can appreciate the little edits that I do you know because it does take a lot of time finding the song editing it because my my computer I don't know why but like my computer is good but sometimes the [ __ ] programs like laggy is [ __ ] like sometimes it'll just freeze and they'll be playing but then like all you hear is the audio and it's just kind of a annoying but I've been working around with it for a while now so I'm kind of used to it but for those of you who want to know what like movie edit program I use I use magics with the X instead of a C and it's not as comprehensive as let's just say Adobe After Effects or you know Sony Vegas and all that stuff it's uh it's more there's like windows movie maker and then there's like iMovie and then there's probably like magics and then the rest after-effects and all that stuff it's not gonna not gonna be like I'm not gonna use After Effects or Sony Vegas in the future because maybe when magics finally becomes boring to me and I want to try something new then I'll probably look look to download Adobe After Effects or Sony Vegas I don't know which one do you guys prefer I I have no idea I don't know too much about video editing software other than how to use it I don't know what's the best one what's the one with the best deal it's the easiest one to use you know I don't know any of that I just use magics and I believe I found it by just searching up easiest video program to use you know so just because I know stuff about magics does not know does that mean I probably know stuff about Sony Vegas so if you have any questions I probably clueless just like you are but yeah I mean we're jelly I got 1500 subscribers I mean I know this has been like the third time I've hit that number but I mean the third time it it just hits differently we're gonna pack this last hit of my [ __ ] just so we could talk but we're just me packing it but yeah mana fifteen hundred that means those 1500 subscribe to me three times already and I really really appreciate it I like you you have no idea how it means to me you know it's like when you're when you're shit's deleted you don't know how many people are gonna come back and like go to your new channel you know especially when you don't have that old channel to promote your channel you know it was just straight deleted so I'm basically working from scratch again and some some of my loyal of subscribers they will they'll notice that you know a I'm not getting a daily video so they're gonna search up my name you know some is probably take a little bit longer but I mean I'm I'm okay I'm satisfied right now obviously it could be better you know maybe I could be at 50,000 right now but who knows you know life life is just random you know and uh like I said like some people say I work too hard for less gain or exposure but it's like some people have to work harder than know that you should know I know I'm okay with that you know I'm totally delete me like the ten [ __ ] time and then I'll fight start reconsidering what the [ __ ] I

the leaders that came up here on stage there's one person who is truly blessed if you're in the crown Club that's $400,000 a year but do you know what this person said behind me president Park I'm already 30 years old I'm so sad I'm so depressed that's what she said son wha why don't you stand up you may sit down she started this business when she was in her early 20s she followed her mother and now she has a net worth of $400,000 a year having just turned 30 years old I think it is a true blessing to become rich when you're still so young it's better than becoming rich after you've become old I think as people get older financial stability becomes truly important if you can become successful that young then you will have more time to enjoy that success anatomy one can pass down their membership code down to three generations you'll be able to pass down your code to your children and to your grandchildren I tell our young leaders why don't you just receive the code from your parents no president Park my parents said that they plan to live until they are a hundred years old that means I will receive the code when I am 70 years old so they say that it is better that they just start now that is why many young people are joining this business as I mentioned many people wish me great blessings for the new year but what does that mean what does it mean to be blessed all of you have come to a truly blessed place many people think that the A to B business is finished because there are 3 million members in Korea and 7 million members overseas but I honestly think it's just the beginning now is the right time to truly join at me go outside and ask people on the street if they know about that to me try asking people on the street do you know atomy there are still many people who don't know at to me as of now less than 10% of Korea's population have become atomy members and hundreds and thousands of those members have gained success there are still 90 percent of the Korean population left there are still many people left who are not members for all of you to become successful actually in the beginning of that to me there was this one type of person we were filling in that person's membership code in the system at about that time our computer system was completed this one member said that he was too late to join at to me he was actually number 50 yeah I said how am I supposed to be successful with his number you should give me a number at least within the first 10 numbers it took at to me a full year to have more than a membership codes yeah today we have thousands of new members every day in the beginning of atomy it took a full year to have a thousand members crown master Lim I think is code number 979 a full year had passed since we started after me imagine how slow our progress was in the beginning so if a person had started a year previously and had a thousand partners under him he was doing better than the average contractor he just had to know that the company was doing well but at about the 1000th member that one member said again it's too late I said it's not that late you can start now there are already 1,000 members there's no room left that same person said the same thing on our 10,000th member and again on a hundred thousand member I should have started when there only 10,000 members when as we grew to 1 million members he regretted for not joining again that person's membership code eventually died that was it some people always say it's too late but really it's never too late amongst Tatsumi members there were only about 10% that are active members even from amongst all of you who are sitting here during the new year I think there would be only about 10% that would put everything into atomy only about 10% would give everything that they have most people I think just came here without much thought that is why there are still plenty of opportunities to reach people there's still lots of room left in this business since the first seminar of the new year I just want to tell all of you to look at the ads of a business from the perspective that it's not too late at all especially Anatomy you can do business here just as if you had code number one let me explain the marketing plan to you guys after a while the rate of increase of your compensation will flatten out the maximum amount is about a hundred thousand dollars a month after that your compensation will not go up that much that means even if you joined ten years late in the business in the end everyone will meet at the top that's why you don't even have to start today even if you don't start today and you start 10 years later you can start your business under the same conditions there will be a little bit of difference of course maybe the person beside you who starts today will have a hundred thousand dollars per month income after ten years maybe you will only have started then and it'll take you a long time that's the only real difference just tell other people and go ahead tell them you'll join five or ten years later it's still the same there will be no difference maybe it might even be better if you join ten years later why would that be what was it like when ask me first started out today we have this amazing building here right we have an auditorium but ten years ago when we first started out we had to pay rent for our office at the time we had an office space of about four hundred square meters the presidents room the company office rooms storage and soul center were all in that space I would eat $2 meals with soul center members in the beginning we had our office name printed out on a four paper that's how our company started out it was very difficult to do business there very difficult you you might be feeling envious of the people that started early let me tell you a story at the time a member had brought a guest to our office and soul I think that guest was dragged there by the member the member kept telling her to meet me she was very well dressed when she came into my office she wore high heels and had very fancy hair yeah I started explaining about our company then she said are you the president do you know what kind of job I have my office is in a high-rise building and our company building has rotating doors now you're asking me to join your business here then she turned around and left the room her high heels were like eight centimeters long I can still hear the sound of her heels just ringing in my ears they were red shoes and that member who had brought her guest was so embarrassed president Park I'm so sorry but honestly I was more sorry to that member than she was to me imagine how difficult it must have been for her to bring that guest but our company was so poor at the time I was so sad that our members were being looked down upon I remember my heart hurting for a long time after thinking such thoughts even under such harsh circumstances the members that had joined during that time have become successful people today it wasn't just an easy journey however the one common thing that everyone said was after me is easier than any other work I've done in the past that is why if you want to join today you will be able to engage in this business in a more favourable condition than any of your predecessors honestly as you do this business you will realize that this business is actually not that difficult that is because atomy has excellent and affordable products it is easy to have the consumers repurchase our products if you keep introducing atomies products to your acquaintances they will keep buying the products because there is no harm done to them by buying Assamese products right if not you must have treated your friends horribly in the past if your friends don't want to buy from you then you need to reflect upon your life and see what went wrong but if you look around your life there are many people that wish you the best right most people will think well it doesn't really hurt me at all if it helps out that person make an income then sure I'll buy it from them just remember just remember this when you're doing your business why then do people say this business is difficult that is because they're not used to it and they like to think like the following beginners think that just by telling someone one time that they're gonna buy from them think about it do basketball players make 100 percent of their free throws let's say a basketball player misses a free-throw is it reasonable for that basketball player to say I quit I'm not very good at this even basketball players can't make that many in the basket what about baseball players how well can they bat even good batters will miss two before hitting one this is the attitude of true professionals so when you're talking to others just freely talk to them some won't listen to you and that's okay but just keep on talking and some of the people you talk to will think do you know how beginners think they will just keep thinking if the other person will join or not and then they wake up one day and say this is too difficult they haven't done anything yet and they say it's difficult but professionals do not overthink too much they just start talking regardless of the responses they just keep talking they keep talking and they don't stop then those who will listen will listen right should I really use those products or not should I go to the seminar or not they start to wonder a pro will just relax and let the others worry about it they just talk to whoever they run into it all depends on the listeners response this is called the law of own mind who is it up to whether they will listen or not it's up to the listener but whose responsibility is it to tell others that's up to you that is why all you have to do is talk to people among the listeners there will be those who listen and those who don't listen every single person in the world does not have to listen for you to succeed if only half of those you talk to will join then you will succeed even if 10% will join you will still succeed if you talk to ten people than at least one person will listen right with that kind of attitude you should just start talking to people and since this is not something that will bring harm to anyone else it's okay if people say they won't do it you can just take revenge later yeah how by making a hundred thousand dollars a month ten years later then you show up a few years later with a driver and tell your friend you will buy them a nice meal there's nothing sweeter than this type of revenge do you think that friend will then listen to you of course they will listen to you remember the only difference is when you start I would like to sincerely welcome everyone who is here in the seminar and that concludes my lecture thank you [Applause] hello itami ants wearin we're having a total of my otta a co-op LACMA i'm diamond master billy

[Music] [Music] [Applause] hello I am atomies Miss Korea new imperial master hey zhongli my life has changed after being promoted to an imperial master I always thought my life was the same but as I was preparing for today's lecture I realized that my life had changed drastically there is a before and after stage in my life before I came an imperial master for about ten years the engine that motivated me was survival however after being promoted to an imperial master it's no longer survival that drives me my concern now is to coexist I have reached the highest rank and my commission will not increase I'm also more free with my time I thought I was done but I could have never been so wrong I had a bigger assignment to tackle and that was to coexist to survive together to live well together to share together I should also have a good life for the remaining days of my life today I want to talk with all of you about the things that I still have left to do and I want to talk about the end result that I'm envisioning for my future dreams the title for today's lecture is from surviving to coexisting my goal from now on is not surviving but coexisting then there should be people whom I want to coexist with right they are my partners and if the sphere of my coexistence expanded it could be all of members of autonomy if atomy keeps branching out to the whole world then ultimately it will be the whole world I believe the coexistence will be possible throughout to me let me introduce you to the first person I want to coexist with she's very fair right she is 87 years old and she is the mother of one of my partner's both of her daughters are doing at to me business and because of that she went traveling recently one day she was with her elderly friends and one of them said that she went to a place with lots of people and there was a lady there who donated 1 million dollars on stage the senior citizen center exploded some said is she crazy Wow she's amazing some said it's possible because she is alone so this lady came home and told her daughter about the story of the lady who donated 1 million dollars which was her prize money then the daughter responded mom she's my sponsor that to me is a business that makes such things possible do you know what her mother said are you going to give it all away as well so the daughter responded mom I will give away the prize money if God says so then the mother asked when will you receive that prize money I don't know mom I'm trying my best and the mother said by the time you received that kind of money I'll be buried in the ground the daughter then concluded mom just be healthy I will try my best to be successful like my sponsor during your lifetime I will succeed so that you can witness it I'm actually not standing here today to talk about my own story I want to talk about our story I'm standing here today in front of all of you to talk about our story our story of doing atomy business this is this son-in-law of the 87 year old lady whose name is young son choi her daughter does at me and this is her husband he is in fact a member of the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra which is the most prestigious Orchestra in all of Korea he is the lead chair for contrabass there this man helps his wife's atomy business very proactively I call him professor on and he is the most down-to-earth person from all the professor's I've met he is as pure as a child and he loves classical music I was able to meet someone because of professor owned this boy here was raised in an orphanage ran by nuns in Busan Jung Hyun Joong the conductor for Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra and its members go to the disadvantaged students to do volunteer work they go to such places and give free concerts and give one-on-one lessons to students who want to learn this boy in the picture was introduced to music for the first time he was captivated by the low tones of the contrabass he also had the talent what do people usually ask to such gifted students who is going to buy you the instrument who is going to pay for the lessons the conductor however lent the boy the contrabass and gave him lessons but no one knew that this boy would practice so hard later on this boy would carry the contrabass on his back and travel to Seoul every week the members of the Philharmonic Seoul Orchestra took care of this boy everyone thought that university would be his final goal but one day he said he wanted to go to Germany to study more everyone was more worried than excited at this point professor Ahn's thought that he just had to send him to universe so he was in no condition to support the boy in Germany he had already sent two of his daughters to the US for studies and he had already tapped into his retirement fund but he could not give up on the dream of the boy so I somehow heard about the situation and I told professor on I will support him yeah this is the result this is the boy because of his great talent he received full scholarship from the school in Germany but he still needed money for living expenses so I'm supporting him for his daily expenses as a result he graduated at the top of his class I'm not the one who is to be applauded I want to point out that it was the husband of my atomy partner who refused to snuff out the fire inside the boy why then does the wife of professor on work so hard in atomy business this is a premium deluxe room of a hospice and union people who are placed here might pass away anytime soon that could be a week or even a month most of them do not last a full year this is one of the rooms of Samuel hospice professor on goes every week to this hospice for volunteer work so his wife who was doing at me realized one day my husband's retirement is coming soon in order for him to continue his volunteer work someone needs to support him financially so the wife told her husband honey don't worry about anything I have picked up a tool called at me let me be your sponsor so that you can serve others with classical music without pay I will support you so that you can do what you love so don't worry do you know what happened to him he drives his wife to the center every day now tells her you can do it honey you said you'd be responsible after I retire right so that I can play classical music as much as I want though I'm bringing home the bread right now I can get back to the society by contributing my talents I can go anywhere now his wife has become his faithful supporter these are top-notch musicians in Korea but they are participating in volunteer work there are different forms of sharing the culture of sharing is spreading like wildfire even without me at a faster rate than you think is the baby boomer generation the only one doing this no not at all this is one my partner's son he is only 23 years old in the military after high school he thought hard about what he was going to do after the military he pondered hard what he should do after being discharged I actually asked him this morning why are you doing at me he said that his mother and his aunt was into a t'me business he said that before he went into the military the two ladies were not that classy but after being discharged from the military he saw how his mother and his aunt had completely changed his mother had been promoted to a star master and joined the leaders club he said that they had become different people his words are actually quite funny if a lady like my mother and aunt can do it so can i I don't think he knows the power of Korean ladies yet the lady next to her is his partner she is actually a lot older than him he is already a diamond master and he is her sponsor do you know what is in her hands they are at me flyers what kind of network do you think a 23 year old will have but still young people have time and passion they can say I'll do it I'll do the driving I'll carry the heavy boxes it's about getting rejected together and receiving compliments together it's about receiving insults together as well he's doing a good job as a sponsor next she is 32 years old she went to Australia to get a barista license she said in the beginning it was great she tried to get a green card there and she heard she could extend her visa easily if she worked at a tomato farm but in reality that was not the case if 13 people worked on the farm they had to split the profits for that day 13 ways so she could not make much profit she could not pay for her cost of living by picking tomato all day at the farm she had to borrow money from other Koreans she could not make money but rather had to borrow money she was worse off in Australia than when she was in Korea when she was going through a difficult time that's when her aunt's told her about odd to me she knew very well about her aunt's situation she knew that they could not buy her a plane ticket so she threw a joke at them will you buy me a plane ticket but her aunt's had in fact sent her a plane ticket she asked again will you pay off my debt and they had in fact paid off her debt also her aunt's used to wear worn-out clothes before from the market but her aunt's were now wearing nice designer clothes you know fancy clothes that all the mannequins wearing the malls so she started to ask what's happening so she looked into atomy business and now she is a Sharon rose master here's another story here's a twenty seven-year-old young man there are a few famous universities in China there's Tsinghua University in the north and Jody Young University in the South his father is the branch manager of a bank he had sent him to study overseas in China during his vacations he attended atomy seminars and started to wonder what he should do after his graduation and he concluded that it would be good for him to do atomy so he became an atomy member without his dad knowing he is doing very well right now and after me he chose a to me even with a diploma from a prestigious university in China he is looking ahead of the day when atomy will be launched in China he knows he will thrive when China opens up he joins at me because of China's potential while preparing for this lecture I asked my partner's I told them to ask their children which words are the biggest encouragement for those in their 20s and 30s one you have our support - don't worry three you can do it four you're doing a good job five we trust you what do you think was the highest response which one that's right it's number two don't worry don't worry don't worry mom and dad are here for you why they say you have to give up a lot of things these days in Korea there are so many things to give up in our society the baby boomer generation including me live through a generation that experienced abundance and poverty however our children's generation are experiencing poverty with in abundance some will spend their whole life just working part-time jobs do you know what these young adults want to hear from their parents it's not we will support you it's don't worry next question from which of the following do the parents get encouraged the most one I'll stay home today - I'll give you allowance three mom dad I got promoted for thank you for giving birth to me what do you think is the answer it was number two I'll give you allowance what do you think is the next highest response thank you for giving birth to me what about baby boomers who are in their 40s 50s and 60s which words do you think gives encouragement to the parents the most it's number one mom dad you're the best this shows that no matter how difficult one's life is if their children acknowledge them then the parents are encouraged here's another one which words do you think encouraged the baby boomers the most that came from their parents one son daughter you're the best - you make living worthwhile three son daughter you are the most lovable person for giving birth to you was the best thing ever what do you think was the highest it was number one it was number one my daughter you're the best my son you're the best the reason why I tell you such things is because I try to say these things to my loved ones these days he's an actor right he's known as the walking actor in the book the author explains in the early years of his career he didn't get many job offers so he just walked so that he would not get discouraged he walked to comfort himself this man walks 100,000 steps a day he walks every day from his home to his job when I read this I thought to myself I should try walking to in the past I've hurt my knees and legs before I've broken my toe as well so I asked my doctor how long should I walk daily and he said that I should walk no more than 30 minutes a day so I walk every day for 30 minutes all of you know who this is right he is the one responsible for founded the Atomic Research Center he is one of the most influential people for the company of atomy I've actually never met him before but my sponsors had an opportunity to meet their partners about a month ago during the meal my sponsor said that she had met professor in soon-jong before she also said that she asked him a question some of my partner's become successful but some quit in the middle what is the reason for this professor you've succeeded in many things in this life what do you think is the main difference with those who succeed and the professor said the single word that separated those who succeeded with those who were not successful it was nevertheless though I had not heard the professor speak directly when I heard this I felt like a bomb blew in my head and I tried to apply this in my life every day I actually knew the importance of his message before professor Jones said that his hobby is running marathons he runs every day he says that when the weather is good everyone runs outside when it rains more than half of the runners are gone when it snows he is the only one out there running I'm actually experiencing this to be true when the weather is nice there's a lot of people outside but for me even if it rains I walk with an umbrella it doesn't affect my walking at all when it's raining I'm the only one walking on the trail I'm waiting for it to snow these days I think to myself it's only raining and there's no one walking I wonder if there will be anyone else walking if it's snowing outside I knew exactly what Professor Jung was talking about because I was already experiencing that in my life I knew the importance of number they're less when the weather is good outside or whether I'm the only one walking outside whether it's thundering outside or whether it's snowing the important thing for those who are successful is nevertheless I don't want to talk about money to all of you I was someone that didn't have to worry about surviving anymore I thought I didn't have anything left to do but that wasn't the case my partners are still struggling every day to survive a week ago I was interviewed at the headquarters the interviewer was from the next economy do you know what the last question that was thrown at me is there any story you want to share without me members I said yes there is something that I hope for out to me members it's very simple what is it I said it is for all of us to live well I hope all of us will live well together the interviewer asked me again what do you mean to live well is it donating a big amount of money like you know for me to live well is when the husband can protect his wife it is when he can protect his family and not get divorced it is preventing the children from suffering protecting them from the perils of poverty I believe that is what means to live well the wife looks after her husband and the husband looks after his wife the parents take care of their children and the children should not send off their parents to a nursing home this is my definition of to live well I hope all of Acme members could live such a life if so Korea as a nation will prosper as well all of you want to live such lives too right then all of you should read this one more time shall we read it together during difficult times nevertheless during harsh criticisms nevertheless when they point fingers at you nevertheless all of you are sitting here today nevertheless why then should we carry on nevertheless it is because we have people we must protect let me show you who they are it's our children these are the children of my partner do you know what her child wrote here let's get that star master rank the sponsor is going on a trip with her parents the mother were promoted to Sharon Rose masters and on their promotional trip they took a photo at the airport here's the son of one of my partners you know what that is right it's a hair styler what does this picture represent he is our future consumer the children are able to dream together with their parents it is not only those who are in their 20s and 30s that's important these children will be the main players in 20 or 30 years they are the children of our partners they will be our future consumers and they will one day lead at me one of the children here is adopted the members husband is a school teacher I didn't know but they already had two children I asked how did you decide to do such an amazing thing and she said that she had always talked with her husband honey though we do not have the capacity to change the world or do something amazing we can do one good thing in this world by adopting a child as our own she said that was why they decided to adopt a child the child is growing well by the love of the family and they went on a promotional trip to de nun she's so pretty right what is that in her hand it's a Tamizh chewable omega-3 they want to have fair skin they are future consumers and they will be the ones that will lead atomies bright future they are growing every day you see this little baby she has grown a lot you see she has food all over her face this is what she looks like today do you understand why we must carry on nevertheless in order to protect these children from losing their smiles US adults must all live well that's the only way we'll be able to protect the smiles of our children I believe we will have lived a good life only when our children and grandchildren can smile like this in at me your understanding of family will change in the past you just had to live well you might have thought I must survive but you won't be happy if you only survive by yourself those around you must survive as well the sales master beside you must live well and the diamond master beside you must live well also the Sharon Rose master beside you must also have a good life only when they get promoted to be a royal master and enjoy freedom for money and time will they live good lives as I told you before I will keep on walking for what for our coexistence in order to coexist with the members about to me I will keep on walking with these children on my back with the 87 year old lady on my back as well as I walk there will be thunder someone will throw a rock at me I might not have done anything wrong but I might be blamed for some mistake one thing that I'm sure of is that though the journey might be difficult at the finish line I will have become a better hey Jun Li than when I first started this journey and the world when I will be at the finish line will be a more beautiful place than when it was in the beginning the stories that I told you today are not my own stories a partner of mine is fluent in English and she said that if you flip me you get we before I was promoted to an imperial master I just focused on me it was all about me but what about now it's all about we it was all about surviving before but today it's all about coexisting thank you very much you you", "BP29rsXLFuU": "[Music] it's 9:00 a.m. time for the only garden talk radio show in

there is a number of benefits to why you would want to have birds come in your garden many people believe that you don't want to have birds in your garden because they're going to destroy the plants they're gonna eat the foliage all that kind of thing and that's simply not the case no birds are definitely very beneficial to your garden one is is that we talk about this is that they will eat bad bugs so they they will eat those bad bugs and there's many different articles online about this about what bugs they eat one is for us the tomato hornworm we've heard of them eating different squash bugs or potato bugs so definitely that's a good reason to invite yeah they're gonna eat the they're not gonna eat good bugs Nature has designed this food chain to where they will eat the bad but the Robins will eat your worms well yeah but you want from the most part the birds we eat the bad bugs and and if they get a few worms that's that's quite alright they're gonna have a lot of benefit in the garden so bug control you don't have to use insecticides or pesticides or organic means a lot of times and we have found this like you said with the hawk tomato hornworm that eliminates it reduces the problem by like 95 percent of the problems that you're going to face in your garden No yeah so now some of them do eat weed seeds so that's that'll help if they're eating those seeds if you let the plant if you let yeah your plans get to that point and we're not perfect yeah and like we talked about it I think it was a couple weeks ago we well that maybe was in a garden talk we leave some wheats strategically in the garden we don't have it a pure wheat free garden because some of these weeds attract the bad bugs like aphids they will attract themselves to the weeds and not the vegetables in which we're trying to grow and we have photographs of black Athens loaded on thistles and the plants next to it that we are actually trying to grow for food not even touch right so definitely if you see that you have some weeds that are a little overgrown you see birds eating autumn or aphids eating on them just let them be because you're you're feeding that wildlife and they're not bothering your plants and if their Birds eating on them and hopefully they're eating the bugs too now people will say I don't want birds in my garden because they're pecking holes and my tomatoes when right before they get ripe or as they're ripe so now I got Tomatoes a bunch we're gonna cover that in just a second okay I talked about the more benefits another one is flower pollination a lot of these words most commonly is known as hummingbirds but a lot of them help induce flower pop pollination they also because they're kind of if they're landing on the plants shaking up the plants they're they're giving that plant some life which is making an educated educating the flower with some of these flowers like tomatoes have the male and female reproductive organs in the same flower so by disturbing it when the birds insects bugs growing it advocates or vibrates that and drops the pollen into the correct location for the fruit to develop right so that's definitely um good a good benefit now here's the benefits not just for your garden but for you one is that you interact with wildlife you if you have kids maybe yourself you can watch the birds listen define that not go out and have them land on your arm like a scarecrow or like Mary Poppins so you don't know you could somebody could train a bird in their backyard don't tell people what to do in a free time so um yeah so you can act with the wildlife maybe if you want to learn their migratory patterns or do some research you could have a whole new hobby some of the birds in your backyard well and and we talk about we're gonna that's one way now how do we bring these birds in let's talk about the the how do we get them into our garden if we I just want to know tape yeah it is also stress relief to watch the birds scientifically proven that if you city backyard you hear this the songbirds watch the birds do their thing it's a nice relaxing portion of your day and for you and it's scientifically proven that does help relieve stress okay well how do we get these birds in our garden then well you have to invite them in you have to give them a reason to come to you and evite no no no they don't have they don't have you know their mail okay yeah so so you want to provide habitat birds obviously like to grow or grow they like to live in in trees or enclosed areas maybe a bird house maybe you could look up some plants that are good for birds things like that but otherwise definitely food so if you not all birds eat seed we've learned this recently there was this thing going around on social media about how the Robins are need to be fed because they were snowstorm occurring that snowstorm because our of our delayed spring and Robin's don't eat seed they eat worms and they eat fruits and berries so it's not necessarily just seed it's also other things and incorporating like we talked about the tomatoes being poked holes in there looking for moisture if you're doing if you that is occurring in your garden you they're wanting something to drink so you can incorporate a birdbath or simply just make it a very simple little tub or bucket with water they will find this I mean you don't they have ponds that these birds go to so it's not like a special little they walk up to the edge of the pond or lake and drink and then they fly away some I'm actually land in the water and and that type of thing so it doesn't have to be elaborate simple functional that's all it needs right yeah you could just you know make a little birdbath or something they do want that water as well now when we feed the birds you want that bird feeder or bird feeders in the center of your garden so they physically have to fly into the center to feed off those seeds and then they can their eyesight will pick up the bad bugs now bird feeder you can have that mount on a pole you can simply do a steak with a tuna can nailed to the top of it and put birdseed in that you want to poke some holes in the bottom that tuna can so moisture can drain out of it during rain but that we do that we've got like four or five of them now plus a bird feeder in the center of the garden so they physically fly into the center not the edge or the perimeter so they can and then birds are very smart animals they find food they'll tell their friends eight there's some over here come come over here and they'll migrate over there so it's not just you know that they learn how to adapt and help each other survive right so just like us standing in a place to stay they need food they need water definitely are all are all good things to to keep the birds in the garden well what kind of birds can we expect if we do these things and maybe already have birds in your garden already and you want to keep them there these are other ways to in order to do that what are some birds that we can be familiar with seeing visit our garden so in Wisconsin you're definitely going to see Robins and then you'll see anything from Cardinals two sparrows chickadees something called a blue creeper or brown creeper a Warbler wrens blue jays songbirds all sorts of little birds no that's that's where that hobby could come in you could try to figure out what kind of birds are coming to your garden maybe if you want to attract different birds what would attract right and a specific seed or food attract specific birds of the that type of caliber into doing that because yeah some people who are bird watchers they have a book in which they check off okay I've seen this bird I seen this bird so it's like coin collecting for them they they identify and they mark off the date and location which they they see that bird but again people indicate you know oh I I don't want birds in my garden well that birds are part of nature birds are very beneficial it's just like you're guarded not many people think about this or some people do think about this your garden is an ecosystem it's a it's a little community within itself and birds are part of that ecosystem and you want to you want to them to strive and live within your little happy backyard garden absolutely well when we come back we are going to

eco garden systems bobbins plants except beans and barley mi gardener outpost natural food co-op root assassin manure tea the gardener's hollowly find all sponsors at the wisconsin vegetable gardeners Commons thank them for their support now back to the Wisconsin vegetable garden radio show intervention that is a sailboat killer oh yeah I know we're coming here and it was this trailer and I didn't know it and I said oh that's a sailboat trailer what I asked you to know that you had any knowledge of sailboat expertise whatsoever grown up by water Gillian telling Pharisees sometimes when it comes to gardening you want to grow plants that actually work for you that you do not have to do a whole lot of maintenance and we're gonna go over a list of perennial fruits and vegetables that can do this now with any plan there is a minor amount of work that needs to go into this but these are plants that will live multiple years and feed you with really you don't have to go plant it every year and that type of thing so let's let's talk about asparagus for being one this is the asparagus time of year we talked about it with great keys a couple of weeks ago about planting em asparagus can last 20 to 50 years you need the disclaimer on all these are it's all but one Jerusalem artichokes we'll talk about that all these you have to give a certain amount of time in order for these things to get right that's just is that this is a commitment so it's not something that if you want something instantaneous and farmers market yeah fine yeah outpost beans embargo by there but definitely these are plants that are going to take a little bit time so asparagus there's a few ways you can grow it you can buy a one year crown or two your crown or you can start it from seed after the third year is when you're gonna get that harvest you don't want to harvest the fronds or the the growth speed fears Sears fears until they're at least the diameter of a number-two pencil right so if you if you see the asparagus coming up maybe you planted it last year and you get excited like oh I have asparagus now just as tiny and spindly let it go oh wait till next year and sometimes you can inter crop in those patches of asparagus with tomatoes or that what is recommended if you're gonna grow something additionally in that spot to utilize the space more effectively our rhubarb is another plant that can live up to 15 years you will have to divide this we can do it in the ground or containers but it that third year is that key of when you're going to be able to get good stalks or you don't eat the leaves the leaves are toxic the stalks is what you're wanting to do right on there a lot of people like rhubarb and want to grow it so that's definitely something's gonna come back here after year now just because we named these off just don't go to blue mills or your garden center and buy it find out if you even like this stuff first before you commit to planting it in the effort and going into it like I talked at our garden talks we get questions and we've had questions about for example how to like row okra well do you like okra not really well then why are you growing it we're not really sure so you want to make sure you know that you like this stuff buy it at the store it's not gonna have that out of the garden flavor but it's going to give you an ideal of if you even want to attempt to put it in your garden right so then we have the Jerusalem artichokes or the or the sunchoke this is something that you can plant now get the the tubers online and you're gonna have a harvest by October this is the exception to all of these right yeah this is more of an instant gratification perennial plant however however it could be invasive so it will spread and so if you if you are like I'm not sure about this what if I don't like it I have these tubers whatever you might want to just try to grow it in a container our first raised bed container we've got a designated 50 square foot area in the garden where that's where that's always going to be now till the end of time now each plant can produce between 4 and 15 pounds of these tubers and the plant actually can get 8 to 15 foot tall and it's related to the Daisy and the sunflower it does put on small daisy-like flowers later on in the season and it does grow very well they're very pretty flowers so it's a kind of a beneficial plant in that way to that they are very pretty flowers and we've grown them in all forms and fashions so and we had a big one behind the compost pile which we didn't know where that came from that produced about 8 pounds of I may be planning a container possibly so the walking Egyptian onions are the Egyptian walking onions they are onions they're spring onion you plant them in the spring they're gonna grow a top set or a top bulb and what happens is that that top ball falls over and then it plants itself and you harvest the roots so it's like that's why they call milwaukee 90 it basically plants itself but it falls over so it kind of is like it's walking yeah as it grows tips over roots another plant grows up falls over and oh progressively workers grow if I'm touch it will compare walked across the field essentially yeah so that's why they called that but that is something you won't get the it won't get the top bulb the first year so you would actually leave them the first year just like regular onions about manuals and the second year you could get that harvest horseradish I'm not sure if you I don't think I think you can harvest your first year it's kind of a as a root crop happens kind of a Yule harvest it looks like parsnips but it has immense aroma now you can eat it just like you would have cared the horseradish intensity doesn't occur until you actually grind it or shred it because then it oxidizes and that's where that intensity of flavor comes from that we're familiar with what horseradish is known for but it will grow down just like carrots underground it looks like a weed if you did not know what it was you would just assume it's a weed and you're just gonna cut it off often and kill it or mow it over that type of thing as big broad leaves on it and it can last upwards of 15 years and you can divide it too you can take those chunks or carrot like I don't roots and move it to a different location not recommended for containers because it really does grow very deep you just want good rich soil even they will grow in poor soil Jerusalem artichokes will poor grow in poor soil Jill that's that's the benefit to those yeah definitely they it's um I don't want to say it's an aggressive root but it definitely it will grow in some some bad soil and so then that that's definitely one you can and that's there's there that some of the multiple vegetables the most common now if you live in a warmer area you can grow kale year-round we had killed at one year that grew up until like December or so because kill is a hardy plant once it's established right right so those are the vegetables root crops let's talk about some fruit and berry items here in which can be that long firm commitment but Purdue's year after year with minimal amount of work I want to talk about strawberries real quick because we get a lot of questions about this people want to start a strawberry patch they don't they don't quite know if that's something they want to do there's a lot of misinformation out there that you can grow in containers that you can grow off the side of your straw bail or you see these really cute strawberry planters that you know the garden center and you're like oh that's cute but it's not it's not really like that strawberries are they need a more permanent home definitely and they're gonna produce based on your variety they're June bearing or everbearing two to four weeks a year and you're gonna have to maintain them if they're in a container gonna have to continually water them we have them established in the ground in 150 square foot area our patches now going on eight years old so it's it's about its life's about over five to seven is about your max on these but if you're if you want to grow strawberries just go to the pick your own farm very affordable you can get more berries and you know what to do with or the farmers market if it's not something that is beneficial to plant three or four plants in a container and try to maintain 50 48 weeks a year to benefit you that was four weeks to get something a few berries off of them that's that's our professional opinion on that you can do what you want but that's we don't see put something in its spot other than strawberries all right I put a tomato in that spot to get twenty pounds of tomatoes versus six eight ounces of strawberries over a growing season you know so that's that's at most fruit trees and nut trees are three to seven years before they will actually produce on on that so let's go to the IBEW organics three in one plant girl hotline we have a question caller you were on the air well good morning uh so happy to be on the air with you both top of the morning to both of you again and good morning Milwaukee good morning mister debo speaking of the edibles I enter a neighborhood here where I'm surrounded by the berries and I noticed that every once in a while when they start to turn you know either burgundy or purple there I'll go ahead and pick some and eat them you but I've got walnuts in the neighborhood and I noticed these people are just letting a lot of this stuff go to waste I sometimes I'll Bowl some up you know but the walnuts I've got I can point out about three walnut trees and I just noticed a lot of this stuff going to waste so I'm just hoping that um a lot of people will you know that are familiar with a lot of these things and a lot of stuff is just growing like you know right right off of backyards and stuff that they're just you know just growing while and they just let it fall to that you know the birds will get some the squirrels may get some but it just I just see it just hits the ground and goes to waste you know I can't I can't eat it all but I'll try and get some of it all right yeah and that's the thing a lot of these places they know it's a pear tree or whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely and I got a couple of pear trees and and surrounding areas as well but a lot of these berries I guess raspberries raspberries possibly blueberries even more so raspberries but the raspberries and the walnuts I see a lot of that stuff going to waste and I took a couple years ago I assumed these were I said what is it and it actually was a walnut you know because up down in Oklahoma well my dad and his side of the family the pecans and walnuts I should have knew you know Nora pecan looks like but the walnuts I I would have never known that walnuts were grown way up here so but I see a lot of the wild walnut being grown and you know the local Milwaukee area so thank you very much have a great day and wonderful show thank you love you both thank thank you very much so yes a lot of these you want to be you know you may have this stuff in your neighborhood one you want to properly identify it and two then if it all is on somebody's property in which they're not accessing and or maybe they are cuz are you know pear trees produce a lot of pears nuts trees produce a lot of nuts you can go hate you know do you mind if we kind of you know I can this up for you or whatever the case is I just don't let it go to waste its money being thrown on the ground essentially nature is giving us to you right if it's right by the sidewalk or something and you want to you know see if or what's hanging over the sidewalk you can always knock on the door and say hey can I can I harvest sometimes are gonna say yeah yeah so again nut trees fruit trees about three to seven years minimum before they will produce but there again there's a lot in the in the city here that are producing yearly well when we come back Michelle balls will be with us she is the author of composting for new generation we're going to talk all about

morning 11 to 2 May 5th well Holly let's go to the ivy organics three-in-one plant guard hotline and bring in our next guest Michelle balls is a longtime backyard composter with a passion for reducing our impact on the planet she spends her days writing laid-back advice for home composters and the confessions of a composter blog teaching classes on backyard composting learn everything she can about composting recycling reusing the waste reduction she has new book out composting for a new generation latest techniques for the bin and beyond welcome to the program a shell inaudible well we're so glad you've taken time out of your day to teach all of us a little bit more about composting because it's a very confusing topic when it comes to to home gardeners that we are found well it shouldn't be it's it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it there's a few basic concepts but after that then you it's smooth sailing I think a lot of people have misconceptions about composting they've heard things you know that may not be accurate or they have friends or family members who are like what are you doing in your backyard so the biggest misconception about composting I always say most the biggest misconception is that it's going to smell and that it's difficult to do and as far as it being difficult to do as once you get a few basic concepts down it's actually super easy to do it takes a very little time out of your day and then the the smell all you really have to do is make sure it's well balanced then that your material is covered and you will have no smell so let's talk about that smell there's anaerobic and aerobic compost piles which is the one that we should be having very good question so aerobic is what you should have and what that means is that you work air and through the pile so when it goes anaerobic that's when you get that that kind of bad smell if smells a little bit like a swamp nine is that there's not enough air in there and then bacteria that have grown into your pile are the anaerobic bacteria so that it will decompose but it decomposes much more slowly and it also creates that smell so when if you're able to work air into your pile then you're not going to get those anaerobic bacteria okay so what what is the ideal recipe for a simple backyard compost something that maybe people just you know they work full-time have other things going on they don't want to you know this so they're thinking about size and they're also thinking about what's what's the best stuff to add to it yeah so the the basic size that you want is at least three foot by three foot if you buy a plastic bin at the store then then you're set they've already figured out what size you need and as far as the balance the recipe you want to put for every one part of kitchen scraps or fresh material like fresh-cut grass that you put in your pile you want about three parts of dry dead leaves or brown material shredded newspaper if you don't have leaves you need to balance that one part green to three parts brown and that's really the best recipe well let's talk about having problems with the compost pile what are some problems that people have one is it Inc putting the wrong stuff in the pile and two I would assume expect being rodents or animals digging in that pile that's very true so you want to make sure that you're only composting fruit and vegetable scraps don't want to put meat or cheese dare any kind of dairy because that is going to create an odor that will attract rodents and those kinds of animals and it's also will create that smell it's just you know meat decaying does not smell good so you want to keep that out of your backyard and then you also want to make sure that you are burying your food scraps every time you put it in and that does a couple things it helped balance like I was talking about earlier but then it also keeps any odors out so that the critters aren't attracted to you then and then it also keeps fruit flies out so we bring fruit flies home on our vegetables from the supermarket and then they will start growing so if you bury those food scraps they will not burrow down into the pile so then you won't have the fruit size problem but there are some flies that are good for the pilot oh absolutely so the you know the baby stage of the Flies otherwise known as maggots those there are some flies black soldier flies in particular where they're actually that's a that's a great decomposer for your pile and the black soldier flies are not the annoying kind of flies are going to fly around your head they pretty much will leave you alone so there are some flies are okay but mostly you're looking at other types of macro invertebrates that are going to be eating your materials well we're talking about vermicompost in a moment but i want to talk about people who don't have that ability to have that three foot by three foot square foot a box in the backyard there is a method called trench or pit composting explain those methods and the benefits that they might have versus a pile yes I'm a whole chapter in the book about integrating composting into your garden and those pit and trench composts are one of those ways to do it and I think that concept is super simple you just dig a hole deep enough that you're burying your food scraps you bury your food scraps you put some leaves in there and then you cover it up so that's what a pit composting then there are people that do that especially if they have a garden bed that is really poor soil and they're not planning on planting anything there they just want to work a little while on amending that soil that's a good way to do that it the trench composting is very similar to a pit but you're digging a trench right and and one really good method of doing that is if you have garden rose you can have your composting trench on one of the roads that you're not planting because it does that as that material is decomposing it does take nitrogen a little bit out of the soil around it so you don't want to be planting right on top of that but it is one way to amend your soil slowly and and it's a pretty easy way to compost because once the material is P composed it's right there in your ground you don't have to harvest it now sometimes people will hear the word Roma composting or Verma posting and are not you know quite familiar with what that is what is something that could you explain that briefly what that is absolutely so vermicompost thing is composting with worms it's composting with a very specific type of worm called red wigglers and you have to so you have to buy those special you can't just go in your backyard and grab some worms and put them in a bin but you build this in the red wigglers they are leaf litter worms that like to be in that kind of material so the the earthworms in your backyard like to dig dig down really deep into the soil these guys don't and they can eat half their body weight in food scraps today so if you have a pound of worms you can put a half a ton of food scraps in that bin they and the material you get out of it they're vermicompost is some of the highest quality material compost that you can make and if you look up online that's like buying some vermin castings or vermicompost you'll see that it's actually quite valuable now with that vermicompost thing two things one I've been told you don't want to add citrus skins to that the unit for the worms and to that whatever device you have these worms in they will stop stop multiplying once their box or bin is at capacity they're not going to overpopulate themselves is it that's right yes so with the citrus for some reason citrus does not work well and a firma composting as you can imagine it is acidic so it's going to change the acidity if this is such a small bin that that's a problem but then whenever I accidentally put a citrus peel and to my vermicompost then I get these little tiny white flies that are attracted to that and those are really annoying so I completely avoid citrus in my vermicompost thing and then I'm sorry I forget your other question they won't overpopulate themselves don't quit whenever the bin is for there that's great yeah so they are they self-regulate their population so when they they'll mate and lay eggs and repopulate your bin as you feed them if you feed them less then you'll get you'll have less worms in there and then if they fill up if your berm your bin fills up with vermicompost that needs to be harvested then there's not as much space for them to grow so they you won't ever have a problem of you know an overabundance of worms and that's great because you can harvest those and create another bin but you want to keep that soil moist because worms want a certain amount of moisture otherwise they're gonna die or get too wet and drowned that's right they basically breathe through their skin so you have to keep a moist environment for them to be able to live so let's go back outside and talk about this compost pile that we've created there is called cold composting and there's called hot composting now if you can we've talked about both of those but I want you to go in the more the science of it and is there a benefit to one versus the other or as long as this stuff breaks down we're in good shape yes age old hot composting versus cold composting debate basically the way I look at it is cold composting a kind of a lazy way of composting which is perfectly fine I mean that completely untouched mentally so the cold composting you don't have to put as much work into it you know you still want to have a good balance but you don't have to turn it as often you don't have to worry about cutting the materials down there has been some studies that have shown you do get a nice a different kind of nutrient profile and since compost that comes from cold composting versus hot composting the benefits of hot composting are that you get finished compost much more quickly it does take more work so you have to be out there turning the pile making sure your aerating it you want to make sure that you know the leaves you put in there are shredded that any food scraps you put in there are pretty finely chopped up you want to make sure you're testing the moisture level you even get out there and turn it every other day sometimes depending on what kind of method you're using so hot composting definitely takes in the work you get finished compost faster but then there are benefits a cold composting right I mean we all are loop live busy lives and so sometimes it's nice to just relax and do things the easy way actually no where can we find your book and find more about you so you can buy the book composting for new generation at Lowe's at pretty much any on Amazon pretty much any bookstore I am on Instagram and Twitter as compost geek if you might follow me there and my silly story but but yeah you can you can find the book pretty much anywhere books are sold well Michelle we greatly appreciate taking time out of your data enlighten us and inform us about composting and how we can do it

calcium is a very beneficial it's a nutrients in which these plants need a way in order to get that more readily accessible to the plan is to dry the eggshell out you can put in the microwave for whatever time period you want a minute or two and then grind it up to a powder then you can incorporate them into your garden hole and it's going to be much more quicker for the microbial life to break down to feed your plants rather than just crushing an eggshell throwing in the hole which can take up to 18 months to break down to a point where it's usable so dehydrate them dry them out let them sit in the Sun grind them up into a powder use them that way right okay so that's good so another question is since we're getting hopefully close to potato planting season I have some time I want to build a potato Tower how does this work is it effective is it something I should be doing no the potato Tower is a device in which Pinterest took and ran with there was a photograph on it and the premise of it is you plant five or six seed potatoes in a four by four square foot area and then as they grow you continue to mount soil up until the potato towers two and three four foot tall and then you open the potato tower up and you have a hundred pounds of potatoes that's simply not the case you find hundreds of videos online about making potato towers but you can find minimal amount of videos online about the success of harvesting them because there are none the potato does not continue to put roots and tubers out up to stalk as one thinks because though potatoes are part of the nightshade family it's not like tomatoes switch on tomatoes every hair follicle can be a root potatoes are simply not that now there are determinate and indeterminate varieties of potatoes but it's nothing that if you allow the stalk to grow nine foot it's going to put potatoes on it all the way up to stalk the universities have done this test and there is no proven University Extension study that shows that potatoes and a potato tower are effective so don't wait waste your space there are other methods that work if you layer the potato as you got multiple potatoes growing in towers but not a single layer it is not effective so let's see here a very helpful video this was in response to how to grow tomatillos thank you this will be my very first year growing them again we've got 1,100 garden videos about multiple growing techniques on the website and we get a lot of comments like that in multiple times a week about how beneficial it is another one is I want to know what potatoes are the quickest to be ready to harvest well that there are three categories of potatoes early mid and late season so your mid your early are about 70 to 90 days your mid are 90 to 100 days and your later 110 to 135 days you can start harvesting your potatoes after 10 weeks of planting them after the flowers develop on them and fall off then you can go ahead and harvest them but any of those varieties as long as you get that set after the flowers fall off you can harvest them at that point how do you divide your seed potatoes and is it even necessary can I plant the potato hole in the ground wait you dividing your seed potatoes typically when you get them from the garden center or online we order we worked with would prey farms out of Bridgewater Maine there especially family owned farm they have 26 specific types of seed potatoes certified you can you get them and their be they've already begun to sprout and that's a good thing it identifies where the growths are going to be on the potato just if you would have bought some organic potatoes from outpost or Woodman's or beans and barley and they began to sprout in your cupboard those can be used as well because there were again but we'll talk about that in a different time you're going to divide your potatoes preferably with two sprouts pert some let's say the potato has four sprouts on it you can cut it in half and have each chunk have two sprouts coming off of it you do not want your potato chunk to have to be any smaller than a medium size chicken egg that chunk of potato that contains in this example two sprouts that is the energy for those sprouts until the sprouts get large enough develop their own root system and detach from that chunk of potato that is why when you dig potatoes up you'll sometimes find that mushy rotted looking chunk of a tail that's at sea but has been detached and you do not have to cut your potatoes if you have a very large seed potato you can get three four chunks off of it you're going to extend your seed stock so instead of having one potato now you have potentially three or four potatoes that you can plant in the row so you're just expanding it whether you do it a plant to hold potato Orin chunk a potato the the yield from some of these university studies have shown that it's gonna be the same you're just extending that seed stock so you don't have to but you can get a few more potatoes and make another row essentially out of what you already have bought or you've gotten from the garden Sam Marilyn asked I have I need a way to keep tomato hornworms from eating my tomatoes this is a problem well tomato hornworms if you do not know if you have them you will know the symptoms or the results it's like you're going to harvest the tomato tomorrow morning you come out and you leave it tonight tomorrow morning and the tomato has basically been ate all around the core and there's some black droppings left or and or the leaves have been ate off your plant this is the tomato hornworm and these that is the symptoms so one you can harvest your tomatoes a little earlier too there you can apply BT too liquid or powder form it's a naturally occurring bacteria in nature you do have to reapply that after rains to allow these insects to ingest that like we talked about in the first segment bring Birds in and they will pick off the insects the good either the bad bugs the worms all of that off your plants you can also not plant in that same area that you planted last year move at 5 10 feet away if all possible disturb that soil right now in the spring or in the fall that disrupts the cocoon in which that larva is living in under the soil and you will it looks like a monarch butterfly cocoon if you're able to find it you want to dispose of it step on it break it up and you'll not you'll reduce your chances by 90% whether you use a spade a shovel a garden fork or tiller disturb that soil where that put that problem was last year and move the plants to a different location and that will help immensely Mary asked I have a vegetable only compost bin I've been putting crushed eggshells on it my question is I've been trying to remove the skins from the eggshells with very limited success after rinsing and drying the shells is this necessary not at all you can dry your shells in the microwave or just let them set out crush them put them on your compost pile you can also grind them up to a powder and use them in the planting hole of your vegetables and that will make the calcium even more readily available things well we are out

as you can see smoking on some lemon Bora today guys lemon board a really really cool thing about this guy's Oh Leo's first strain that is one to one or if not very very close to 1 to 1 ratio you know onions we're gonna have I got some stuff on the lid yeah but live resin so very very nice very very honey like distillate like delicious start up I just let's just take it down for you guys right Cheers so women boy guys starting off with the packaging readings we got 274 milligrams of THC a 47 ft HC and CBD a is going to be kicking at 293 milligrams so right there perfect with it so about this concentrate guys like I said Oh Leo's first one to one and basically what this means to people who don't know what one to one means is that the ratio of THC which is tetrahedra cannabinoids to your regular cannabinoids CBD cannabinoids regular cannabidiol basically is one to one what that means is that you're not gonna get a really sedate of effect off of this you're still gonna get a little bit of a high but you're not gonna get a really oh I'm bait you know you're gonna get more of a sativa I feel like if more of a sativa type high from this and basically it's it's super flavorful just like every other [ __ ] thing olio outputs out but let's see if we can't get we don't want that big sure that's too nice to bright over there but beautiful beautiful colors in this very very floral e unsweet on the smell and comes in and takes you with with a nice lemony a soft lemon with a finish of a a light cushy OG type taste but that's gonna be it for this review guys lemon bora from olio extracts this is a live resin guys check them out guys thanks for watching if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you hate this video I don't tell you sorry I don't care only good vibes around here guys peace love Cheers see you next time bye", "1mM9c26qJJk": "[Music] folks what is going on my name is Steve Stevenson this is Maryland marijuana review where I bring you my humble opinion on the things that I buy I buy a lot of things you know what I'm saying some good some bad some in between but I promise you I give them all a fair shot because um yeah you know I mean there are a lot of buds out there and I just want to try them all gotta catch them all toki mom so let's go with the first bud of the day here I'm going to do one that's um this is called blue dream let's start on blue dream quick readout on blue dream I'm having some technical difficulties so I'm gonna keep checking the camera to make sure it's not giving me any sass back so blue dream blue dream is a protein cross between the ever popular classic strains blueberry and Hayes crossed with blue dream or Azure haze depending on who you ask and this is coming from Wicky leave huh so that's about where we're at on that I don't know about all that but um yeah anybody that's followed my uh my videos or whatever I did a review on this a few maybe like right before Christmas time I got some CBD blue dream and um I was very impressed I was very took in the back if I had to give a simple comparison between the two I would say there for the most part the same plant though this CBD strain had a little bit more a little something extra in the scent that I wouldn't say was desirable and I would not say that it is on we'll leave it at that so blue dream let's do this let's post a picture yeah let's get a picture up and then I'm gonna do this let's get on the review so as a part of my a-game I'm trying to up the quality and give more information on the roundabouts of the things I buy so instead of holding the butt up which I can still hold the butt up I don't know if it'll do you any justice but this golf ball-sized nug I got from nature's medicines on route 40 and oh yeah I like the non prepackaged flower you know it's reminiscent of the old school I mean sometimes if you get an ounce they might even put it in a bag it's the decorative bag though it looks like it's not that bad yeah let me see if I can get a little housecleaning so our first video for 2019 how was y'all's New Year's did y'all do anything exciting entertaining hopefully um I'd say put it down in the comments section but I don't want any of you all to be uh breaking any laws or putting anything if you did anything unlawful respect yeah so that being stated um yeah I hope you all had a good one all things considered this blue dream the smell in it hmm you know it has a tropical yet fruity kind of essence it's something that uh it sparks my interest on many different levels be it from the taste of it to the smell of it to just all-around it's um yeah it's really really unbelievable and like I say this uh this does break down it stays pretty pretty well together but I'd imagine if you were to crush it and you know grind it up good you could definitely do it well with your fingers but if you were to just give it a nice slight break up you could do it without a grinder and you could definitely roll a decent joint with this I haven't gotten that far yet I'm more or less use it as a seasonal flavoring for my not so flavorful weeds because our review buds always do I don't always look the greatest to [ __ ] sometimes I just look [ __ ] because it's a hundred and eighty an ounce or cheaper yeah well let's give this Blue Dream a day in court hmm lighters ooh okay oh yeah wow that is really good it's so tropical it really does have like a tropical flavor to it that's the best way I could put it I don't know if a blue dream is a tropical drink but I would imagine it would be yeah something pretty pretty flavorful something with pineapple in it I'm not saying this weed tastes like pineapple and I'm not saying this sweet is gonna give you heartburn like some sort of weird pineapple drink but um yeah it's not bad at all like I say if um it's too early to give it a signing factor as to what my favorite buds are for 2019 but I'm honestly gonna say this blue dream is up there in contender and I'll take it at that it is a good but a solid but all around it gets the Steve Stevenson mark of approval some ash and it also gets a odd high-five to the grower so I will try to find out who grew this I will try to put as much gathered information as I can into the comments section or the the drop down description so I'll try to be as you know informative as possible that's one of my new year's resolutions do a better job at the videos I make yeah y'all we're gonna take the time to watch I'm gonna take the time to bingi bring you the best product that I physically can yeah well folks it's been a pleasure um my new camera my new sound equipment my new I guess that's it for now I got a new cell phone too but we're not talking about that so anyways folks y'all have a good one Steve Stevenson over and out thank you folks always a pleasure indeed", "CuVgKq5OkZw": "okay guys or uh back again with a heavy hitters so this one's a bubba kush they're calling it an indica and it definitely is more in because than anything else but I don't know they could almost call it a hybrid because you definitely get that head rush and and there's even like a lemony undertone to the taste but generally the effects are indica dominant more of a body high and it's interesting to see the testing numbers on this I think it's almost the lowest THC but it definitely isn't on the bottom of the scale as far as effects are concerned for me I mean I like it better than me better than that Orange Crush which was like you know two or three percent higher on the THC I definitely like this Bubba cush better so yeah it definitely tastes like a but Kush is that real life I don't know earth-tone cush flavor coming through with like I said that like aftertaste of lemons yeah definitely in the dominant you can see though Carter still looks the same I heard there's a different different type of cartridge out there so looking forward to trying that out when it comes along as you can see with these bubbles I mean it's just crazy thick I have it should be the concentrate and there should be thicket here if it's not it's generally got terpenes added to it that aren't cannabis derived pants you can got that like fuelie flavor to it as well it's probably more prominent than the lemon it's taste like that old-school Bella oh yeah they did a really good job on this one as always it's got that at testing in the batch number you can go look up on on their website and it's from a reputable lab that steep hill ABS same packaging were used to and I just wanted to give you guys a look at that one so there you go that's a public push from heavy hitters starting to see these go down in price too so hopefully that continues through through the changes here in January so we'll see stay tuned for more and thanks thanks for watching I hope you liked it", "7ccMRze0g1g": "you catch July 6 I'm gonna open this up don't think you're gonna be any bigger than what these are these are still

"five metro boy vasquez we're gonna be doing another cartridge video thank you guys for watching you know i really appreciate all the support all the love i've been getting um if you haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i'd really appreciate that but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself my bad on the um uploading videos you know just my schedule is kind of [ __ ] up and i'm gonna be out for like about a month month and a half of work i best pump out a shitload of videos for you guys but today guys um i read that on my cartridge um i've heard of the cure company i was smoking a cartridge of it and kind of ran out so decided to go get another one but if you guys haven't had these cartridges guys they're so fire they're this is the cartridges but the taste is spot on like the quality it's so good it tastes like actual weed you know and the cartridge is ceramic which is dope so that's pretty nice but um i ended up i ended up getting a buddies cartridge guys uh those who've had buddies those who've tried buddies before the cartridge let me know in the comment section of how it was i've never had buddies before the reason i ended up getting it it's just um there's like a couple people that will always comment on my videos saying to try buddies that it's so good this and that so so the good thing about these cartridges that really caught my attention is that their terpene profile they have a label on there um you know um telling you what specifically is in the cartridge which is dope you know to me that's like some good packaging you know really catches my attention you know because i like to see what's in my cartridges and here you have the nice um it tells you what kind of terpenes you know you have in there so that's pretty dope so the total thc on this cartridge is 82 which is not bad for a live resin cartridges because if you guys know live resin ranges from like 60 to 70 percent you know it's not like this lower distal cartridges range from 80s to high 90s so that's pretty dope so here we have the i was looking at the flavors and [ __ ] and this was the one that caught my attention it's a peach flambe pineapple upside down cake that sounds hella good right so that's one of the reasons i ended up getting this cartridge is just like really caught my strain really caught my attention so here you guys have it it's not like a dark amber color like other live resins are like dark amber color like the ursa cartridges or like a moxie live resin you know it's not as dark but it's really clear and it has a nice little tint to it so i'm gonna go ahead and try it out for you guys i was hitting it earlier but you know i'm gonna decide to do a video today uh for you guys because um i'm gonna be going on my little run today i'm right here at a park you know do a little jogging get some runs in you know but other than that guys cheers hopefully you guys are smoking along with me let me show you guys the quality on it it's pretty good you know so we're gonna go ahead and try it out the taste on it it's like spot on it tastes like actual weave that's a good thing about live resins you know um if you guys have these in your pockets after hitting a couple times this thing is going to stink up here man like if you're like in the office or like at your job site or something be sure not to have these in your pocket because these live resident cars just do stink up your pocket and you know people are gonna think you have weed in there that's how strong they are but it tastes really good guys i'm going to take another hit guys to get extra bait you know cheers now the taste to be honest guys it does taste like a little peachy but at the same time you do get the fruitiness of a pineapple which is pretty so the flavor is a little bit peachy and you do get like a nice fruity pineapple flavor to it but it's like a really good clean pineapple it doesn't taste like a fake like a distillery type of flavor you know it tastes really clean you know i'm really satisfied with these cartridges they also have some uh besides the cartridges they also have some wax which i've never had before but i'm definitely gonna have to try them now because these cartridges are fire guys so this is my little label that i got you know my dispensary so you guys can see i don't want to hear another but other than that guys um i've been pretty good myself and i'm just kicking back let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see but i'm gonna be getting into like more weed videos you know like more pre-rolls and [ __ ] like that you know just like i said i've been really busy guys but you know i'm not gonna stop making videos you know what i mean this is this is something i enjoy doing so i'm gonna keep doing it so and also you know let me know if you guys love these types of cartridges these sea salt cartridges are [ __ ] good you know every cartridge option they always hit you know with these cell tips they're like the best ones you guys can get cheers guys i'm already like high as [ __ ] like before i got to the park um i was hitting it like two three times so i'm already loaded so hopefully you guys are smoking along with me man now for the price i ended up paying like thirty five dollars for a full gram cartridge of live resident buddies that's a good as deal guys all right here we go you guys have weed maps look up the shop uh patient care first or just type in pcf just type in pcf and they'll come up and you guys can just literally look on the website and the prices you guys see on there it's the exact same price but just maybe like five dollars with tax you know so it's just [ __ ] cheap everything like cartridges but not dirt dirt cheap but compared to other prices in other cities it's it's a bang for your buck so yeah i'm just trying to get baked that [ __ ] before i go on my little jog [Laughter] it's mandatory you guys get paid before you guys do exercise that makes it so much better i don't got the crawling guys i'm just coughing but other than that guys i really appreciate you guys for watching my videos and if you guys would like to see more videos like this go ahead and leave a like and don't forget to subscribe if you guys are new to the channel i would really appreciate that and don't forget to add the at

definitely have diamonds show you here you can see all kinds of diamonds in there that's a nice big one right there besides that one can't see I don't hard to see because the jar but I'm not gonna open the door cuz I'm still going on with the process as you could definitely see diamonds are forming in the bottom of this solution that we had I mean are we professionals I'm making diamonds no but you know we're learning you know they probably hat is a little more to it with exact right temperature and you know the exact right consistency but we are definitely making diamonds from what we are doing so there's no denying it there it is and you know obviously the more concentrated your solution is the bigger your diamonds well the more more diamonds you'll get in that container because I mean if you don't have much THC in there you can't you're not gonna fill the drawer with diamonds for sure but we're just gonna leave this here and not a carry on I mean we're in no hurry to smoke this and we'll give you some more updates down the road but you know and the job is a big fatty right they're starting to clump up along it so as the process continues they will grow once once you

using a better jar to be able to see things as well stupid designs around it I'm thinking that we're gonna get a lot better results as far as quantity produced you", "aNnT6Ig6HZo": "and what's up how we doing guys today I'm going to show you how to make a strawberry cheesecake by shape shake say that really fast got all the ingredients out here and I'll show you how to make that try to do it with one hand because I am holding my camera phone right now but some people have asked me how to make the actual buy/sell shakes and I thought it would make a video of it okay so here we go first off what we have well we have our whole frozen strawberries yes they are frozen we have almond breeze on milk you could use if you chose soy I wouldn't recommend it for the guys but soy hemp milk is good rice milk you can even use actual milk dairy milk if you'd like but I don't I'm not lactose intolerant I just don't prefer it anymore oddly enough I only drink almond milk it's soy free as you can see it's lactose free there are many other brands that you could get I just get the Blue Diamond one there's several others that you can choose from if you choose to make this particular strawberry cheesecake shake mix you can do it with either the jello that we have here it's with two two tablespoons which are two teaspoons which I mean there is that two teaspoons or you can do it with actual cream cheese and that low fat cream cheese whichever you prefer I just have the jello sugar-free fat-free jell-o pudding mix right here so the pudding mix is the way to go trying to avoid the actual jell-o gelatin mix I don't know I didn't have very good success with that anyway and then we've got of course our lovely lovely by a shape nutritional Shake Mix why is this good people have asked me well let's do a little research on the back here we have it's gluten free let me see if I can do some there we go gluten-free lactose-free it's also kosher some of the really cool important vitamins that you see in here by the way we've got 90 it's there we go 90 calories from two scoops that's for one shake we have less than one gram of sugar we've got 12 grams of protein 125 milligrams of potassium you see down here we got 30% our daily value of vitamin A C calcium D button K which a lot of people don't get niacin riboflavin and as you can see over here we've got vitamin b6 b12 phosphorus magnesium zinc copper manganese chromium a lot of the great nutrients that we need for our body they are all right there in the shake so if you have two of these a day two of these not only doesn't help you lose weight one lose weight one but two if you're trying to gain muscle it'll help you do that too especially if you do it after the gym so does both because it's providing you if you have two shakes 60% of all those nutrients that you saw back there so there's that I got my little 1 1 cup cooked scooper there for my strawberries and here is my lovely blender let's not advertise stuff in the background haha again this is a one-shot deal so there's no editing this is what's gonna go up so anyway here we have our blender so of course we're opening it up again this is one-handed I guess I should have had all this stuff open first but whatever I am going to put a total of 2 cups of almond milk in my blender alright so and you're opening up this bad boy to give us our strawberries pour these out without making a huge mess showing you that it does not take a long long long time to do this it's really quick you just have your ingredients and you put it all together so there go our strawberries right into our almond milk set those to the side here ours our jello mix as it's falling out some wants to come in there and they may not actually know what that is so we're gonna take our little two tablespoon scoop here this is much harder to do with one hand I didn't know it was gonna be that difficult okay so we've got two of them in there as you can see and we're gonna go with our by shape mix now as you can see in the bag it has a scooper that comes with it already so what we're gonna do is we are going to take you you should do two rounded scoops that's not founded two rounded scoops as you can see there for your normal shake i I'm going to do three because I went to the gym earlier so I want that extra protein for myself okay so there's our little mess it's not that bad anyway so there's our ingredients everything is in a blender it'll get loud here for a second but it doesn't take that long we will push running away lovely lovely shape shouldn't take too long blender off frozen strawberries some people put ice cubes in there but I don't feel it's really that necessary all right there you go pouring out our shake into the cup as you can see it looks very very good - it's not lumpy it's not grainy anything like that we have some leftover and now we will drink it so I'll turn the camera back on me and this is all one shot very good very nutritious tastes pretty much like a strawberry cheesecake and it's good for you I would say if I was to add all the calories that I put together here with the almond milk the strawberries the cheesecake by shape - by shapes 90 calories so I put three in there so you can figure that's 135 I'd say a total calorie count for everything I have here is probably around 250 calories the Vice shake despite itself is a buck 50 so this meal maybe cost me mmm two dollars fifty cents $3 or something like that so cost-effective so I'm not going to Burger King and you know getting their food there McDonald's whoever doesn't matter Taco Bell for two dollars fifty cents for three two bucks I can't get very much over there unless it go to the dollar menu but don't you need crap so this will keep me full for the rest of the night really what else it's cheap it's good for you it fills you up and you lose the weight so again this is what we have in there one other thing that you could add which are things that are with the transformation kit with physalis is this little bad boy and I actually forgot to put it in there soon and that let's go fight rim it's to help curb your hunger so I'll probably blend that up again actually I have a live shot here and you're already watching this so I might as well go ahead and do this so pouring that back in you know just in case you forgot some stuff actually I'm going to put a couple of things in here so we're gonna take this and uh you're under my chin there we go you're zoomed in how we're gonna do this with my teeth okay it's open and we're putting it in there the white trim will help you not feel so hungry as well so that's there what else would we add well see we want to add what's called Nero Nero helps with energy so a lot of people have asked me why do I not have energy drinks anymore it's because I have this bad boy this is a raspberry flavor so it's going to change the flavor of the strawberry cheesecake a little bit it'll give it a little bit of a raspberry flavor to it you can see there it says raspberry boost but it keeps you going so let's put that in there - lets blend it up right and make our shake drink our shake there yet alright so here I am again down hatch and just as expected has a little bit of a raspberry taste know the by trim doesn't have any taste at all so you could add that to anything if you didn't want to if you want to curb your hunger and not eat so much of the food that you're already getting so hopefully you liked since this offshoot video today I told you I'd make a daily video but I'm hearing to

"-ObpIP0JzzM": "all right everybody back with another one of my favorites has it got to be the strongest one the strongest brand on the market I've ever tried all right another heavy dinners this one candy apple it's a hybrid I didn't look up the strain info on this one but boy does it taste like apples it's wild it's like just as distinct is that that strawberry strawberry cough I mean tastes like strawberry this tastes like apples it's like a sweet sweet and sour kind of Apple taste and once again they had the testing on the back here from from steep hill Babs along with the website 80 percent total cannabinoids 85 yeah 85 percent THC this is way up there and once again you can definitely tell just by the viscosity of this stuff thickness what's in there it's not all runny like most of them that really water down there concentrate with non cannabis derived terpenes these guys seem to just put it in there with you know just enough just enough of the consistency that I can run into the cartridge yeah on the inhale it's like totally sour apple and then on the exhale it's kind of turned into a sweet apple aftertaste and it's a hybrid but it's definitely more on the sativa side of things so yeah it's a good good one for during the day you can see how slow that those air bubbles are going up I'm gonna give you an idea how thick it is and I mean they stock too they didn't even get all the way to the column none of the other ones do that and in my opinion none of the other ones are as strong as these guys man that taste on this is just amazing I mean you can tell it's not it's not fake it's not like some weird added flavor it still got this cannabis reminiscent taste to it but boy the apple flavor is just crazy I've never tasted anything like that same thing with that Strawberry Cough I'm not sure if this is another DNA genetics strain I think Strawberry Cough is but once again heavy hitters about those of themselves over this candy apple and truly tastes like a like a candy apple it's a little backwards cuz you get the sweet after this hour whereas candy apples covered in caramel see it's a sweet first for this one and tall the sour apple first and finishes sweet but uh there you go thanks for watching guys I hope you liked it and feel free to ask any questions below I try to answer any of them so there you go thanks for watching see you next time", "OI4eHrhmVjE": "oh you guys want a big Dan over here coming back at you yeah and uh once again we're gonna go over THC diamonds and uh yeah let's get to it so uh a lot a lot a lot of people been asking me all kinds of questions all that stuff I guess some of you guys really don't even know what it is I see a lot of different questions different comments and I just wanted to go over it I've got a fresh fresh batch right here just put that down get better lighting so basically what you're looking at is high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract or HCF se now there is a high Torpy full-spectrum extract that is very similar but that's basically just the the tur Playa poured off this is just the cannabinoid portion which is our mainly THC a so yeah guys uh a lot of questions on how it's made if you can make it without dewaxing if you can make it without a closed loop system if what exactly is it what's the difference between this and Shatter is that contaminants left all that stuff so I'll try to go over a few questions and answer them the best I can [Applause] first thing there is no contaminants this is fully d waxed at negative 50 degrees using dry ice in the columns now some of you guys might not be familiar with B HOH extractions in general and if that's the case don't don't try making this stuff again if you only have trim or you know like a zip or something like that a flower don't don't waste your time making this stuff you definitely need enough of Fayum material to make diamonds this right here is about a hundred grams and I've been using my six inch by 36 inch column which fits five pounds in the closed-loop system so it's a fairly big common material column so I do run a lot of flowers you know what I mean and I do I do a live run I don't fresh no fresh frozen none of that basically and you can mix trains this is a couple of different strains in here and when I do Fino hunts and I say you can't get a full unit off of a female like a few plants or whatever then you got like 40 different strains growing and you don't just want you know a few zips here a few zips there you just want you know straight units to do what you got to do I'll end up just running it all just like this and making a mixed batch it provides great flavor especially if you mix in like Heitor P strain with a high THC strain you could get some great results just taking a few puffs and so bear with me guys if I if I take a little pause or just taking a few puffs but um yeah so the main thing is is there's no containment it's we're running this do you wax with a two micron lab filter so um and we're running all clean great perfectly indoor flowers no pesticides none of that stuff I don't even now spray foliar sprays at all not even in veg I just don't see a need for foliar sprays but that's a whole nother subject so yeah that that's that process as far that as that goes now can you just make shatter and then turn turn it into this I'm not sure I don't do that maybe you could get like a zip a shadow throw it in a jar spray some butane in it let it sit and it might stop crystal getting some crystals in there and reform and seems like a possibility I think the science behind it will work but um that's not how we do it and to get you know to get better results like this with a nice gold interrupts and a clarity on your diamonds you're gonna need a high end flowers and fresh is best it contains more chirps and also the the trichome heads ain't all [ __ ] up and smushed and shakin around and beat up so those fresh heads definitely uh definitely cause good diamonds to form you know what I mean so if you got all your nice fresh heads everything's nice then you're gonna end up with a nice product like this now as far as making this without dewaxing I'm sure it's possible I think if you leave the lipids and the waxes in there I think the diamonds form more jaggedy and I think the lipids and stuff will stick to the diamond so you won't get such a pure product and your diamonds will contain those waxes will end up sticking to them and stuff like that so it is what it is as far as open blasting right into a jar I'm sure it couldn't be done again I don't see why not you know you're doing the same method just way too deep waxing and close up system it's just like a little bit better so I'm sure you know people at home still doing that old tech with glass tubes or whatever they're doing I'm sure it could be done that way as well but again guys if you're only running little runs and you just you know got a blast like a zip into a small jar you know you might get a little crystal formation but at the end of the day you know who wants to waste two weeks just to get like a gram or something like that so I don't see that very uh you know very uh worth doing but um anyways yeah so basic method you know you take your take your collection pop dump it into a jar leave some butane in there make sure it's soupy make sure it has enough of butane and then basically you could do it in room temp dried ice whatever you want just say your jar over there and don't [ __ ] with it and after five days you'll start seeing a little bit of crystals growing at the bottom and then after 14 days you'll have the biggest diamonds that your product will produce which all is strain dependant it's all up to the strain around how high the THC is and stuff like that now again the crystals that you see are THCA and the source that you see is uh cannabinoids and turkeys so the sauce will contain CBD CBG cbn ta CB and a bunch of other cannabinoids as well as your terpenes like lemonade mersin piney and stuff like that so I hope this helps explain I know there's a lot of questions about it and I know you guys are you know there's not a lot of people sharing sharing the info but basically the Diamonds just formed wit time it doesn't really have anything to do a pressure or anything like that as far as residual solvents you can't take this in vac it again when it's done like you could take these and just pop it in the back at that point you're just pretty much backing off terpenes after 14 days and at room temperature and there is uh under 100 ppm s of residual solvents left now in most states is a 5000 ppm limit so again 100 ppm s is like nothing and your shatter your wax probably has more butane trapped in it then this stuff does some people like to say the bigger diamonds do trap more butane I find that it's not the case and that's through different testing from different labs stuff like that anything that goes out has to be tested has to pass especially in the recreational market so yeah as far as residual solvents yeah there's no I'm confident to say there's no residual solvents that will not pass a test I'm not the only one making this stuff there's plenty of people out here doing it um I'm just basically the only one showing you how it's done and not been in top secret I feel like it's not a big deal again I made the first diamonds myself by accident by storing runs when you're doing lots of runs sometimes you don't have room in your back chamber so you'll dump it in a jar and you'll see you jaws out in a cooler or somewhere in the fridge or wherever you keep them and you'll you know you'll keep those in fact those another day and then when you're doing multiple runs you might have 16 20 jars stashed up and some may sit for a week or so and then uh yeah after a week I started noticing that it's not separate and looking a little weird and then now when I dumped it out to vac it I noticed that there was a big tarp layer really liquidy and then I noticed that there was big chunks of crystals and I was like Gil what what the [ __ ] is that and after further examining it I noticed that those are straight Tac egg diamonds and um yeah basically that's how that's how a lot of us figured it out that's how I myself figured it out by accident and um ya know again you can take all these diamonds out and wash that with pentane or something like that and then purge that off and just have have your have your Terps in a different layer and your diamonds in a different layer but this is a full spectrum extract so it hasn't been separated I didn't make diamonds and then added Terps back in or anything like that this is just full spectrum from the plants so you get every single thing that's in the actual flower that you wanted that makes for a more pleasurable smoking experience and I think that's right now I think this is the most superior extract on the market and it speaks for itself so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video smash the like button if it helps you out if you like it subscribe share comment holler at your boy and any

comment share subscribe See you guys in the next one", "-LOgUO7XJMU": "[Music] what's up guys simply secure and back with another video we got our NJ takes a picture Jimmy no RJ eats subscribe to the home he's about 580 right now let's get him to 600 should be a easy goal you know I'm saying but this is not about RJ even though he's in here subscribe to him but but if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge and this is by far the cheapest live resin cart that I was able to get my hands on I did give money to Randy cuz he stopped by the club yesterday and he bought it for me I've been mowing him the money and he got it from me but this is buddies and this was for 30 to 50 and this is about the cheapest live resin car I've ever like received or not received but and yeah I've tried buddy's before so nothing like special or new here but it is a new strain it is a lien push can you open it hold on we're gonna have a Randy open it not right now I'm gonna oh it shows the back first so these are the terpenes that are on there as you know with buddies and you can see right there on the right it says manufactured April 3rd that's by April 3rd 2021 all that good stuff you know just talking a monoids 280 7.39 on that alright let's go just get this pop oh and baby just come of it yeah so you can see very similar to the select cartridge I've had a buddy's cartridge before guys so hold on thumbnail right here hey there we go all right my ugly askin to or not it's a bad habit but a lot of people do and trying to start the bad [ __ ] done better anyways but you can see right here it's very much similar to the cartridge type of select but this is alien cush so I'm interested to see if this tastes like [ __ ] uh thank the lemon salt stuff that everything's been tasting like I hope not even though I like the taste of that is not bad it's just you know I'm kind of like all right kind of taste something different so was the first time you tried buddy's cars only like five four or five months ago so I've had it before they definitely run out quick these cartridge types the they go out quick turn it off we're gonna take a blinker so they don't last as usual as long as like a water and probably like a short like a day or two earlier it would run out on me but cheers boys popping a session below what you guys just smoking up let us know man always keep us updated to keep us in the mix we want to know man you know I saw some strains you guys are commenting on the other day kind of forgot honestly all the names oh well that's a hitter and yes the cartridge hits and apparently it says these are ceramic coil carts as well so that's a that's probably why it tastes very very much it's a tasty experience that's probably like looking resort so a real stoner high then this is the wood good starter huh just good tastes good it doesn't taste like the light like like an OG Kush it is alien Kush you know so it definitely has the more flour taste and then the more citrusy taste that you would generally get from sativas or everything else on the market you know saying but that was a good hair right yeah excuse me boys let me take another hit and we're probably gonna call it a video after he gets another hit and he's gonna do a blinker no blinker I got not beat so hot from the room that had a good level huh just so you guys don't think don't believe me with the 3250 program I'm gonna show you it's a dirty price huh for live resin that's a very good price and you know this this video is not gonna come out until like a week or two so I don't know if they're still gonna have it but I will show you the proof right now just so you guys believe me and it's not all talk you might make the drive from where you're at just to get like you know she's in product yeah so 32:54 the alien cushion 30 to 50 for the blue skittles as well so cheering yeah but yes stay tuned we're also gonna be doing another video with money I know you guys have been requesting money or aka be cheapened because he can take fat hits that hits the ones that you like to see you know I'm saying like he will take those packets and yeah my homie don't give a [ __ ] so I'm gonna take one more hit how do you like this cartridge so far 8250 would you buy it and consider buying it for 30 to 50 yes I would anything higher than that probably not it was more than 40 I probably not go ahead and buy a cart unless I know it was beating some fire I'm saying this is I don't know definitely it you can spend basically happy oh yeah you can split that in half in at 2 grabs with some wax spend another $3 each you know on each one you get some decent good wax yeah but as a cartridge person once again he's getting price on the cartridge yeah I'd buy it for that price that's a good-ass price on the it for grams - that's not you're spending like half a gram sometimes almost at same price for even just a little less so that already tells you that's a good purchase you know yeah yeah definitely what's go in and buy something like that if I was looking to buy a car okay that's good to hear we are gonna end the video here guys hopefully you enjoyed it subscribe all that good stuff like the video if you enjoyed it subscribe to rj eats and see you guys the next one [Music]", "SNcjm3YRIHk": "what is up family organic Ombuds back with another review of some mac

blue one we picked up some candles yeah that was crazy though yeah that was so how long did we wait it was like 30 30 45 minutes yeah for sure it was a while though it got a lot longer once we left in total we all picked up like 50 candles total for a little more for sure yeah the deals though for real they were ten dollars each yeah we had to it was like he said that he wasn't going in mind with like grabbing some but they ended up getting eaten i ended up getting so i kept showing her something she didn't like any of them and i was like i want them so i ended up buying all the ones that she didn't like so she's like you got to put them in your studio instead of our room that's fine like i'm with it that's funny what are you guys favorite candles comment down below do you guys like candles as well i feel like she was talking about how earlier she never imagined when she was younger that she was going to be waiting like a candlelight you know excited yeah like things that you never thought you would be so happy for like i never honestly thought i was going to be owning some crocs too like when they first came out like i'd be like what's the hype about like peripheral they're not comfortable though they are yeah we have it on the red setting which is the lowest setting so we're gonna get flavor of that concentrate very excited yeah i'm excited i always like trying new products it's always fun um i've never i'm not gonna lie and say every product i've tried has been the best because there's been some concentrates where i'm like oh [ __ ] no what about you guys

earlier before there's two huh even like a seven gram joint anna blantee pulled up with the blunt how did it taste it didn't taste like purpley did it taste purple um it tasted more on the turkey side for me yeah for sure oh it's sour diesel my bad yeah you're expecting like a grape type flavor yeah i really was i'm like damn but it wasn't bad i think you'll get a flavor dude you're like i'm getting all the wreaths for sure i'd be doing the same [ __ ] can't waste wax it's too good to be wasted you know we're gonna start unopening this up so we're not just looking at edmond and just

whatever i guess we got a pretzel but like we didn't even finish like a snack you know yeah like a little pre breakfast oh that scene has a 20 second blinker that's insane that's crazy that is insane i've actually attempted it it's not fun to do this more like uh i gotta take out the camera and do it here and then it's not like i would do it every day yeah and we were just talking about it like you don't do a blinker honestly every single time you have the chance like more of a challenge type of [ __ ] yo this thing's getting high for sure though i think we haven't smoked in a while the cartridge i feel like it tastes like a dab yeah that's just like really dab like uh-huh it has like i thought it was gonna be fruity some type of foodie but for sure it gives me like more terpenes yeah concentrate um vibes like a dab you know you're smoking like some strong [ __ ] for sure just based off the flavor yeah you can take another dab pack it up yeah they're gonna be back to back that was the last one to take it down still don't have to get down damn you ready to eat yeah i'm ready to eat hello like i said we're about to go eat um i think i i need to hit the ursula a little more but i actually liked it um i wasn't bad because i felt like the cartridge definitely gave me that like liquid diamond effect like a dab effect i felt like it was a [ __ ] dab out of a cart um so i would recommend and i like the packaging too i like products that go all out with their packaging and are just creative it's just not a whatever packaging yeah focus the whole universe vibes for sure

before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so this video I actually have a concentrate review for you guys so shout out drip right here at the brand rip they have some [ __ ] fire wax um I did some uh views on them in the past but mine did I picked up the diamond [ __ ] this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire I haven't smoked this yet um dad a buy one get one deal Oh am I so originally I wasn't planning on making this reviewing video for this sided [ __ ] you why not I haven't done review videos in a while so I heard he smoked the other grand that I had it was a different strain than this one so I don't know I should have did a review on that but I didn't know this shit's [ __ ] fired now I smoked one grandmother diamond to you I'm excited to try this his this [ __ ] I don't know if I should look stupid fire like let me show you guys some close-ups in a minute and that's gonna be the judge of that but um the shout out drip like I said bro that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire so let's put them those close-ups and then I'm get into this review so all right so yeah let's just go over the packaging real quick and then open this up we'll get this smoking on it or I'll get the spoken on it I guess I wish you guys could smoke with me but and then I'll get to reviewing it after that you know what I mean so I hope you guys are smoking along but for the top of the box comes in this little box this is a little sticker that the dispensary throws on but just says I dripped one gram sauce diamond nothing really too important on that sticker and I mean so the box I really liked it um the logo drift it's like you can flip it upside down and it's like the same and that I'm saying and it has a color of gold I feel what you call that [ __ ] shiny letters I'm saying I had like all the box so [ __ ] fire he was like there are social medias if you want to check them out I doubt you again so I I just see reviewing that papaya no it's that wrong I'm pretty sure I don't know something like that so yeah papaya um leave us an indica so that's the box their presentation is fire you open it up you're greeted with this say I don't know I think this [ __ ] the packaging is like fire that [ __ ] looks dope police in my opinion I know you guys think down below you guys are getting the close-up shots but let me show you guys just again real quick cuz this [ __ ] is [ __ ] it's like white brother like that shit's crazy I don't know I'm excited to smoke on this one I want the key my really before it but they made this video but I didn't have any alcohol off it's a little bit dirty but this is what I'm smoking in all of this is over Cyclopes and crazy foot gets the job done we're gonna do a little taste test we're going to a high test and then I guess just like a smoke test the packaging I can give that a rating right now I'll get the packaging probably about like a 4.5 out of 5 patacoins [ __ ] fire it's nothing not like too complicated it gets the job done but it's like [ __ ] crazy it's dope you know and I mean they all give a like a 4.5 on the packaging and then I'm so we're gonna do a taste test a smoke test the way so it's probably gonna smoke crazy you know I mean the smoke test I usually like do like how how well it like blows clouds the only me if it smokes properly and [ __ ] I'm going into a high test a price point so this [ __ ] was $60 a grand actually but it was a buy one get one free so I didn't technically paid like 30 a gram but 60 dollars a gram if they don't have that deal going and then we're gonna do like a overall review it's like all those things like overall review thing that I'm saying so let's just hop into this I've been talking a little bit too long so I've been talking a little bit too much so let's just hop into this so yeah I drift diamonds [ __ ] on fire last look at it and I'm gonna get like a not a huge dap so we're talking both my carb cap the other day so I got to use this as a carb cap but it gets the job done so I'm what I was saying though I'm not gonna get the biggest tab right here and I guess what the older taste as first I'm gonna get get a close-up shot of me getting this wax and the dabber in a second like look at this [ __ ] the camera doesn't want to focus on it too well with that [ __ ] as though they're like almost [ __ ] white bro that's crazy yeah I'm gonna take this little that's actually a pretty fat dad but this is gonna be put a little taste test real quick so I don't know that [ __ ] looks crazy I can't get over the looks of this I can't get over the way this looks this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] crazy like I said I hope you guys are smoking along hope you guys are smoking something banking if you are and [Music] and also I don't know if you guys in my last review I did a northern might should be on these duchies I also had these what is this this is a purple dream if you guys want to see a review on these cannabis cigarettes let me know down below in the comments oh yeah so the papaya diamond life not libraries and um paya diamonds so kind of hop into this so we've done a little pace that's now so like I said that shit's [ __ ] so5 um so right off the bat there's not too much [ __ ] flavor it just tastes super [ __ ] clean like that's really all I'm getting right off the bat I'm not too familiar with this Drano so let me look up this strain on leafy and see what this drain sports the tastes like and I'll write in kind of um say if it did or not you know I mean but now that she was super smooth like you seen how that [ __ ] was hidden that [ __ ] like that [ __ ] ripped um barely I didn't even off you know I mean that shit's super clean super smooth so syndicate strain like I said cross with critical number thirteen with ice to to make their own fruit and not their own this is what the taste is similar to its tropical fruit counterpart but a spicy peppery side also becomes apparent that's what I was gonna say actually on I was gonna say it tasted a little bit sweetie like a little bit sweetie it's a little sweet I'm gonna taste super slick that doesn't have like that indica skunky like pungent paste what I mean that you'd normally get with in the goods as I go sweet like fire like clean paste that like super super fire I didn't really get that peppery side just like kind of like sweet tropical foods like I said definitely [ __ ] [ __ ] fire bro look let me get a close-up shot of me getting a DAB on I brought avert so setting that you [Music] alright so that was kinda hard to do with one hand like what the phone wasn't handing it to have another name of the fabric but you guys seem that [ __ ] it's like super crystal e the color brother that looks at this [ __ ] looks 5 out of 5 this shit's [ __ ] fired someone take a bigger dad now not the biggest but I don't want to smoke up all my wife's right now so we're gonna do a little bit of pretty big though so we're going to pick the high PES now I guess so let me take this pad - yeah how smokes and then get the higher rate [Music] another Shih Tzu just won't be like some of the best class I've ever had I mean my opinion I don't know like that at least took the best wives I've had in a minute that I can remember you know I mean but this shit's fire so um yeah we've got a pretty big tab here like I showed you guys so if you had this moving along walking shears and let's [ __ ] get it so [Music] [Music] super clean though bro like that ship obviously hurts my chest a little bit cuz I was like a really big dad but not as bad as you rethink your like how big I dad was a gosh it's actually like super clean um I should definitely [ __ ] fire the high out give that like I don't know I'll say it's the best looking box I've had but I feel like I've had more potent whacks um especially like THCA like I've had like that's just I mean well this might this probably is considered thta but um I don't I feel like I've had more potent wax or whatever you want to call it but this is like the best look in my opinion at least and it's why is this on still alive yeah but this is definitely up there though this is that me some of the best ways I've had it not the best um so yeah the packaging I gave like what a 4.5 out of 5 the taste I'm gonna get that a 4 out of 5 that shit's fired Mike doesn't it's not - it's not filled with flavor but it's like super clean like super super clean with like a hint of like sweet fruitiness I'll explain so let me get that like a 4.5 if not a 5 out of 5 because that [ __ ] is near perfect the way it smokes that she drips you see that I'm gonna get out of the street 5 out of 5 probably the high pilot a 4.5 out of 5 close too close to a 5 out of 5 just feel like a patent more potent or acts out there I feel I just feel like I've had more potent wax but not to say that this isn't [ __ ] stupid fire you know Stephanie stupid fire the price points exceed always a gram that's really [ __ ] expensive let's say I have like a buy one get one free deal I wouldn't smoke this on the daily but you feel like a nice little treat here I'm saying picking this up in the future but the price points $60 about this little high I'll get that like a 4 out of 5 the bottle one get one free deal five out of five like basically $30 grand you can't go wrong with that but if you're paying this rates they see that spend it expensive so the overall score and we get out like I did 4.5 out of 5 this is [ __ ] insanely father the one nice my one complaint really is just how expensive is this my one complaint is the [ __ ] price point which was a little bit cheaper you know I'm ballin on a budget out here but um stupid fire and I'm definitely pick it up if you see it in our area but besides for that you guys like this video a good a big thumbs up comment like subscribe if you guys want to see this video let me know they don't glow in the comments to guys like these review videos let me know definitely comment so how to keep doing them and decides for that money ready so", "x0x2LxOs7vo": "hey everybody how are you long time I think so I've been uploading my podcast episodes to my youtube channel but it's been a while since I uploaded an actual video I think the last video is about me getting stood up again anyway today I'm a cooking channel I'm pretty for those of you cuz I don't know how to speak for those of you who don't know I have gone keto I fallen for the trend I drink the kool-aid not really cuz kool-aid not Kido so far I've lost about 15 ish pounds of fluctuates yay but yeah so I've lost roughly around 3 inches around my waist I've been doing this for about two months I like it guys it's not bad now here's the thing right so on keto zero sugar you can't there's no there's you can't you can't do it you can there's substitutes you can make your own move so it's my birthday on Monday guys August 5th and my dad's birthday is August 1st so we're combining our birthday celebrations this year because I can't have cake since I'm on keto so I figured if my dad and I combined our birthday dinners with my family my family could still have cake and celebration of my dad's birthday and you know they won't get all sad and anyway we had cake on Father's Day cuz my sister's boyfriend brings desserts every single time he comes over no matter what the occasion is and I awkwardly sat there just staring at everyone eating cake well I just sipped on milk so I figured that I would make my own dessert for my birthday for me my dad's birthday dinner tomorrow this way I won't be awkward in there just staring at everyone enjoying desserts while I sip on milk so this is what I'm gonna make guys I'm making sort of a creepy type II thingy deserty thingamabob here are the ingredients this is one of the ingredients it's a coconut wrap for those of you who cannot read these are fantastic I've been using this as as a wrap like a tortilla wrap sandwich wrap I've had this is like my new I've had breakfast with lox and cream cheese and tomato wrapped in this I'm gonna make bacon egg and cheese in it this week it's fantastic it's it's what is it it's it's for net for grams net carbs per sheet and it's coconutty it's just coconut it's organic the ingredients are organic coconut meets organic coconut water organic virgin coconut oil that's it and it's great and it tastes like coconut and it's super duper it's mildly sweet there's no added sugars nothing nothing nothing nothing it's just coconut so I like the contrast of the sweet with the salty ingredients I usually added it but today we're going to be using this as a dessert round uh I think it's not gonna be a wrap you'll see whatever chef check this guys guys oh my god anyone on any type of diets creating haven't you anyone with a sweet tooth on a diet any kind of that I don't care what that I this is the chocolate brand do you see that my get close enough just so you can kiss it that's how good it is I want all of you to know kiss your screen because this will be the greatest thing you'll ever buy on it so okay first of all one piece is only 45 calories that's first of all for you Cato people are you ready are you ready kiddo people and low car people one piece is one gram net carb oh my god oh my god Nellie that it tastes amazing for that tasting good for a diet chocolate or whatever it is no no it tastes amazing as a chocolate in general okay it's like one of the best chocolates i've ever tasted in my life and it's sugar-free and putting ingredients ingredients is unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter you know the regular like corn fiber so either the other but instead of sugar they used monk fruit and there's like vanilla beans in our wood they're regular chocolate ingredients but just the difference is instead of sugar there's monk fruit in it so carbs yellow amazing amazing guys get the chalk zero please don't go get it go get it so the other ingredient you sing is justin's almond butter so cannot peanut butter peanut butter is too much sugar at it um so I'm gonna use almond butter chalky why don't you just use peanut butter with no added sugars cuz it doesn't taste fun okay he just tastes like chewed up peanuts to me almond butter is lovely and it is only 2 grams that carbs per two tablespoons guys so a pretty decent amount of butter for stupid amount of carbs especially for this desserts that we will be sitting and eating all ourselves with no added sugars and such so ah those are the ingredients and here's what we're going to do with them yeah okay so the first thing I did was preheat my my toaster oven I use a toaster oven because it's I you know it's small and it's good enough for me so I preheated my toaster oven to 350 with parchment paper where I'm going to lay the coconut wrap can you see the coconut wrap is like shiny on one side and it's kind of Richard on the other and not rigid like whatever that weird texture and it's it's pliable it's very flexible so I make wraps out of this it's super fun also when you heat it up it doesn't get crunchy it it turns into the consistency of a creep so I thought it would be super fun to make a crepe-like dessert next is I'm going to be adding two choc zero squares because I want I want this to be very chocolatey when it melts I'm gonna spread it around and hopefully it'll be lovely and it hurt so it is my birthday after all I'm going to indulge so I'm gonna actually just pop this into the oven without the almond butter because I'm gonna kinda almond butter after the chocolate melts because everything's going to be soft right so the wraps gonna be soft and the chocolates really soft and I feel like if I melted the butter it's just gonna run and it's not going to be fine and I want something to kind of like hold everything together I want to be like it's gonna be like the submit the owner is gonna be like to cement to hold everything together so yeah so I'm gonna pop this in and then we'll see what happens afterwards yay okay okay guys it's out as you can see it's the wrap is nicely toasted brown and the chocolate looks melted I had it in there for roughly five minutes and I'm going to now spread the chocolate is melty lovely this is nice it's smooth it's not burnt at all it smells like coconut and chocolate right now in my apartment guys anyway I think that's spread enough I'm only doing it on one side because I want to I'm going to spread the almond butter on this side okay so we're gonna use okay let's see what one tablespoon will look like so it's I'm doing this is gonna be one spoonful almond butter just roughly one tablespoon which is half the serving size Oh guys also for those of you who've never had almond butter before you're good to see oil sitting on top which is fine I teach this because they don't have that anti separating ingredient that most butters nut butters you know mr. Morgan stuff because there's no other ingredients other down be I think the nuts and whatever else is in there it's because that's why there's oil sitting on top but just mix it around it's fine and it's delicious guys we think I think one spoonful is going to be enough I feel like if I add another one will be too much it's it's just spreading lovely you don't have to refrigerate almond butter either by the way room temperature is recommended so that's also a good thing okay guys now let's fold it let's see the total last time I made cheese quesadillas and it got soft this is interesting we're learning together guys okay that's fine maybe it was the cheese that made it soft oh this is a learning experience okay so let's fold it again just because okay little messy little messy and that's fine so it's like um would you call this kind of like a bootleg pop-tart very thin one and so let's paste it guys  its construction the way it looks it's delicious guys holy  guys I have chocolate all over my camera Stan just want to let you know this is freaking okay so what would I change about about this hmm I would probably pre-cut the sheet into squares this way I can layer when I construct it after it bakes so to the squares will have chocolate on it and then two won't two will be blank and those are the two that I'll have a I'll put on the butter on and this way I'll stack them and it'll be I know I think that's more kick like anyway so that's what I would change otherwise am ia genius or what I mean this is oh my god so remember the the sheets are sorry the sheets are four grams net carbs each chocolate square is 1 gram net carb and 2 tablespoons of the almond butter is 2 grams net carb so this is roughly 6 grams net carb um the way I made it I think right - it's no seven my bags I use two squares of chocolate so 7 it's kind of high it is kind of nice for a a dish that's not a an actual meal but it's for today's you want to treat yourself I suppose I mean what's seven with seven grams net carbs right just be good that day you still have like 13 grams left for today for breakfast lunch and dinner and if you're doing intermittent fasting easy-peasy so yeah so I think I am gonna I'm gonna do that at my parents house tomorrow for my birthday dinner and this way I can join everybody and dessert so yeah that's it I'll post I guess I'll push the ingredients and stuff on the bottom low and yeah oh I have a podcast guys I've been doing this practice for a few months now I just started uploading to my youtube channel it's it's different from all its own different to mine now it's a little raunchy er it's very not PC so if you're oversensitive about certain things anything not certain things anything if you're over since it about anything I

connoisseurs and I got a good one for you today all right so I picked up a gram of summed abstract live resin this is some Hawaiian golden pineapple libraries and gems and juice there's some of the numbers there the Terps teetsi you guys already saw this whenever I did a review all I'm doing right now is I'm gonna try to play with this stone that's in here so you guys get a good look at that diamond community digger another drop it right on the old mat there [Music] you know you can see this is one faceted stone there [Applause] [Music] I can smell this this is just it's a very piney super um spicy [Music] kind of a smell it's um it's very solid as you can see it is one solid piece and this has a lot of Terps on it and my dumb ass has dropped it not to worry like I said it is just one solid chunk [Music] all right well that's been John with CNC connoisseurs playing with a diamond that I got in a grandma dabs you guys have a good one and as always tune in for some more we'll see you later peace", "l5Ft--ZR3FI": "[Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it's another steel axe video and it's a different strain obviously but you know I ever was really really impressed with the first dizzy wax so why not do another one you know I'm saying this one's a different strain if you couldn't tell from the title you know I'm saying it's mimosa it's a sativa and it's just as fire so we're gonna bring this out for you and I like to mention that I did try it already because here's the story I got it yesterday and mommy bought it for me if you guys didn't see from that video and I gave him 30 bucks he bought it for me because he was going to the club already so I told him you know can you pick me up one and he gave me one and I didn't want to go to Blake's house empty-handed so we used some of this wax we we do eat just been smoking so I just thought I'd let you guys know you know there's I'm not trying to lie in here and stuff so you know there's a reason why there's like a little clip right here and if you do see it's a little skimped a little bit you know it's not really in full gram it's because of that so as you can see dizzy knows I ain't got the good stuff you know positive going too fast okay and like I said it's mimosa and we can go on the THC percentage as well it's 79 percent THC so we're gonna go right here I didn't have this on the last one so it's good that we have this little but let's just there you go you go pause if I'm going too fast okay guys now I'm saying I'm sorry for the lighting I did let me see if I can get some laying here there we go there we go alright so got the trusty utility in five you already enough video so let me open this guy's and show you what it actually looks like no the thumbnail looks pretty good right that's why you click on the video so right off the bat very very nice package and very simple you know sticker that protects it off I'm saying this is uh this is area its dizzy mimosa and I'm gonna show you guys through the camera so let me just show you what I'm looking at and the smells are not as like as strong as the other one the banana pie but oh my god just really good as well still not too stinky but wow look at that and all its sauces up there so me packing it here [Music] I've noticed I tend to notice because uh I don't know if you noticed in that one video Monty bought like five my grams are this stuff most of them are like whitish whitish oil or wax very very strong smelling though get rid of that real quick okay so this is packed we're try this so cheers boys [Music] very very flower tasting it's like I don't know it's a very very close to the flower taste you can get very very clean taste you know it's like if you remove all the stuff that you get from actually burning the plant and you just get the all the essentials essential oils and all that stuff and you're just trying that this is what that tastes like you know I'm saying I've never truly tried mimosa the strain but I've heard there is like a hint of orange because you know mimosas isn't they like orange juice and like champagne I do not get a hint of orange on this it's more of a very very cooked kind of taste if that makes any sense has a very similar taste of cookies I will take another hit though because this [ __ ] is fire and I just woke up from a nap and I need some of this kickstart with the rest of this day so just did another one of these hopefully I don't drop my dad to lien [ __ ] [ __ ] but let me know if you've tried to dizzy wax I mean I've met I've recommended it my home he plate says that you know I did he says that it sucks that I had to make a video on it because once I make a video on it I basically put it on blast and you know everyone one kind of goes for it and that's what I wanted to do you know I'm sorry for Blake you know like he I mean first come first serve you know I'm saying so at the end of the day I want you guys to experience what I have so if you guys are in the Modesto area and you guys look for my channel to like get the best like products or getting best like look at the products before you get it you know I try to do that you know so that's cool you know like that Blake was like yeah she had made a video because now everyone got it and she I'm like damn that's crazy the the power of the internet you know I'm saying so cheers boys [Music] I wouldn't recommend this if you try to be discreet cuz this is smell it's just my leg astray like you they know you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] you know so I'm gonna pack one more hit for the video then we're gonna end it here let me know like I said if you try it's Disney wax I know it's pretty new I looked online and it's like I'm like the only one with a video on like their wax so it's pretty crazy I would have thought that I would have been a little bit later you know all these influencers or cannabis content creators in LA I would have thought they probably would have got one from like dizzy themself but now and did a video but I'm saying cheers boys [Music] [Music] very KFC tastes to a very nice gassy taste you know when you get like you try like that good but like that kind of gas but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this dizzy wax I know it's another one that I've done but like I said I was very much in love with the first one so I figured you know let's dedicate another video to another stream so other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music]", "4aVNgNb2cnY": "a my

confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all today i'm going to be dabbing on some garlic cookie sauce from grassroots let's crack the seal on this as you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ] video on live browsing and don't forget to subscribe i

ivory organics where we grow cool plants and today we're gonna be talking all about blueberries and I'm very excited to share with you that I found two wonderful varieties to be growing in warmer climates and specifically when I talk about warmer this could be pretty much all of southern part of the United States as these are low chill requirements or basically require fewer cold days during the winter as sometimes we go through a winter without it you know much of a cold experience as here we are now on the second week of January and it's only rain here once whereas at least one half to two thirds of the country right now is covered in frost so definitely a warmer climate we're here in Los Angeles California to be specific and the two varieties of blueberries I'm going to talk about shortly we're gonna talk about the care the management the planting practices and all that the first thing I want to share with you before we even get started is I'm gonna take you to UM here just a couple minute lecture maybe even one minute lecture from meeting I had with Tom Spellman who is of the Dave Wilson nursery who is one of the largest distributor of trees specifically fruit trees even drawer and dormant trees in the country if they're not number one they're the top three distributors of trees I had the privilege of meeting with him and attending one of his lectures from a year ago and I'm happy to share that with you and I'll even put the entire lecture where you can enjoy it at the end of this video but specifically what I want to share with you is he said that pretty much all fruit trees will do better in the ground than they will do in a pot with the exception of one plant and guess what that one plant is we're talking about it today blueberries blueberries in fact do better in containers than they otherwise will do in the ground and the reason for that is is that they don't like their feet being their roots wet they don't like to be continuously wet and when they're in the ground whether it's you watering the plants or mother nature watering your you know your landscape when that soil stays continuously wet it causes the roots to rot and and compromises the health of your blueberries so that's the reason blueberries do better in containers because you can actually manage the water even if it rains a lot in your area if you've got the right potting soil in a potting mix for your plants it'll be fast draining it'll get the water out of the way we're going to talk about how to prepare your container in just a moment and just want to share that with you so the two things again as Tom Spellman said that is most important for the health of your blueberry plants as one is to make sure that it's got fast draining soil and secondly is to make sure that the soil is acidic and we're going to talk about acidic soil in this video as well so let's get started I always feel this way most everything is going to grow better in the ground and will in container but there's there's an exception to that the exception there I think is blueberries how many people have grown blueberries well I absolutely I have lots of different blueberries of all in half the wine barrels some barrels have two or three or four varieties in the barrel and I just draw one you know structure and nothing makes me happier all right there where they can reach them and I just think there's four container culture blueberries work really really well there are two things that are important for blueberry culture in Southern California and we have all kinds of varieties that do well anything that's considered a southern highbush blueberry or a southern hybrid blueberry will do well in Southern California with soil mix and you need fast fast fast drink so the first thing I want to share with you are the varieties of blueberries that I picked for my home garden if you come in a little closer you can see that this variety over here even though it's not on the front of the label it just says blueberry that's not enough you need to know what the variety is and do your research on it if you take a look down below over here you can see it's called a misty blueberry so we're looking for the variety misty and what they shared about it we're gonna match it to things we researched on the internet but it's a compact shrub blue green foliage and bright pink flowers high quality medium to large berries and you want to make sure you plant it in Sun um the other variety that I have here to my right is the sunshine blueberry and this one here says it's a dwarf evergreen shrub up to three feet tall but by the way there's some research that says it's as little as a foot and a half in height produces fruit mid season low chill requirements and again 150 hours is fairly low for blueberries and tolerates Heat another interesting thing I want to share with you as well on this Leigh Abell is it's amazing how cold-hearted these plants are they can tolerate temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit and when it comes to this variety over here the misty variety it can go as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit so quite Hardy plants the other thing too about the misty Bharati that's closest to me is that it says and you got to see this over here this is quite extreme it says that the size of the plant is going to be somewhere between one foot and ten feet and that's not a fair representation of the plant that you're telling me that it's going to be somewhere between this big and four feet taller than myself that's a huge discrepancy what this label is predominantly sharing with you is it's basically sharing with you the range and height of blueberry varieties but it doesn't specifically talk about the misty variety of blueberry and the reason I want to know the height is so I can position it in my garden in the right spot my goal is to you know when it comes to your landscape is to also work on the landscape design and you wouldn't want to put a blueberry bush that's gonna be six to ten feet tall in front of another one that's gonna be further away from your point of view that's gonna be smaller the goal is to put your largest and biggest varieties in the back and your smallest varieties closer to the point of view where you enjoy your garden the other considerations are to also look at the movement of the Sun across the sky as we all know the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west but you don't want to see how that movement also corresponds to your garden we're gonna be talking about that in this garden as well but what I also did and it's necessary to better understand your your blueberry varieties is they do a little bit of research and let me share with you where I found mine I basically went over here to Burpee and they're actually one of the stores that are carrying the I very organic products as well which I'll share with you towards the end of this research but if you take a look here the blueberry sunshine blue basically reads as a cold hardy variety that requires only 150 chill hours which matches the label adapted to vigorous productive growth in San Diego Southern California to Seattle in the northwest bears a rich sweet medium-sized and ripe Middle East season is upright compact habit and blue green foliage so that turns burgundy and fall make sunshine blue especially decorative and Potts tolerates high pH better than most blueberries and is self pollinating which is great oh you turn the page I also found here on groworganic.com a little bit more about the blueberry bush specifically what I wanted to know about this is the bush habit and here it says upright compact bush reaching 3 feet tall with Bluegreen burgundy foliage in the fall so again this here is the sunshine blue variety which corresponds to this very plant over there on the right the first one we discussed was misty and I will read again from the Burpee website interactive and productive Southern High Bush variety easy early to fruit whereas again the other one is more of a mid season so we're gonna have misty first and then we're gonna get to enjoy the armed sunshine blue second but early to fruit the medium to large sky blueberries are a spicy sweet the upper ice spreading four to six feet tall so now we have a range it's not one to ten feet it's 4 to 6 feet tall plants how bright blue foliage that contrasts with pinky white flowers and spring and make lovely ornamental shrubs with the foliage of turning burgundy in fall plant with other varieties for better yield misty has a low Childre choir man if 300 hours seems a little high and does well as far north as Seattle Washington chill requirements refer to the accumulated hours of temperatures as plants experience between freezing and 45 degrees Fahrenheit that is required to break dormancy and then I cross-reference that with grown organic donk home as well and my goal again you can see that the chill hours matches 300 hours and I want to see the habit again upright spreading Bush reaching 4 to 6 feet tall so now I've read in two different sources and now I'm convinced that this is going to be somewhat of a larger plan so this variety goes over here and then the last thing I want to share with burpies if you go to Burpee comm we're gonna be using that foliar spray arm in the diamonds in the ivory Ganic three in one plant guard protection from sunburn insects and rodents I'll talk about how this can be applied to also on benefit your blueberry plants among others and your keyword search when you go to Burpee comm is plant guard and you'll find it there like so let's get started so I'm most excited to share with you I got these two wine barrels they're actually constructed out of plastic you can do the same design looking using wood you can also use clay pots the choice is yours but the thing I was looking for most when selecting the pot was size I've selected something that's going to be a 5 gallon roughly a five gallon container it could be a little bit more a little bit less but the goal is this going to this is going to contain the root size very well for the first at least two to three years of this plant's life and we're going to watch and grow these together as I like putting up periodic updates throughout the year the other thing too that we learned from Tom Spellman I'm not taking credit for this but he said that the best time for pruning for those of you that already have your blueberries in the ground is not in the fall or winter but in fact it's in the summer the goal is you're going to want to control the height to the size that you desire in this summer and allow enough time for it to grow back a little bit more before it enters dormancy in the fall and that will actually maximize the amount of flower buds that will maximize your yields come spring in summer so for those of you you know watching and learning about blueberries for the first time is you're gonna prune your blueberry plants in the summer after you basically harvested your blueberries and again for those of you that have subscribed you'll see those videos says we're gonna care for these blueberries together the first thing I want to share with you is take a look at these pots when I pick them up you can see at the bottom and basically a plastic an plastic container with no holes at the bottom so no way for drainage so this is not ready to use yet the other thing over here is that I found at the nursery is that this one here was cracked and we're not gonna have a problem with this as you're gonna see how we're gonna end up using these containers we're gonna use this crack to our advantage and I was able to also pick this up for about 50% less these containers I was able to purchase for about $20 a piece this one being 50% off ten bucks and what we're gonna do despite this major crock in the container is we're gonna add some more drainage holes to it because we learn of the two most important things for blueberry care is acidic soil and rain and rain it is key that's the reason blueberries do better in containers and they do in the ground because we can control the amount of water these plants again so let's start off with adding some more drain holes so did I make my point check out all of these holes so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I'm guessing about a dozen holes across the bottom and this is now gonna be ready to install in the garden no so now let's continue forward with our second container so you can see here with the second container basically did a little bit more of a circular design with four more holes in the middle so let's get these containers installed and continue on with the planting project so here we are now in the midst of several fruit trees in the fruit forests of our backyard and as you can see just above us is our ice cream banana one of three varieties of bananas we've got grown here in the garden if you take a look up this is now the second year that this ice cream banana is providing fruit this mother plant that you're looking at is just a sucker that was off a parent plant that we harvested over 60 pounds of ice cream bananas just last year so we've got these ice cream bananas it would have ripened within on average 90 days from the time of bloom but because again of the hillsides and the limited amount of sunlight we have during the winter months basically the growth and the ripening process and everything is just on halt so I would expect again as it did last year between the months of April and May the the metabolism of the plant will pick up the ripening process will continue we'll get to enjoy another hopefully 60 pounds of ice cream bananas let's come in a little closer so the goal now is to basically decide on the position of the container and this is critical whether I put it on this side of the fruit trees or the other side of the fruit trees will affect the productivity of our blueberry plants so here we are on this side of a fourth day avocado and if I were to put the container let's say on this side of the plant it'll be in a better position than if it were on the other side of the plant and for a lot of growers see the majority of growers they might not see a difference they just basically want to go with locations and where it looks best but it's not always about looks you got to think about how is it going to produce the best if you're up in the northern hemisphere as it is most of Mexico United States and Canada then it's going to be the southern side of your tree that's going to be exposed to the most amount of light resulting in maximum shade on the northern side of the planet so if you take a look here at for example our Forte avocado tree and again you can see in here the ivory organics that was coated when we did our summer pruning to basically shield the underlying tree trunk from basically you know sunburn and this basically offers you know insulation both in the summer as well as in the winter but you can see on the leaves and this is the point I want to make to you oh and I can show you the can of the product that we use so it's basically this product over here it's ivory organics three-on-one plant guard protection against damaging sunburn insects and rodents and you can see that we've coated all the way down to the base to basically protect it from girdling rodents we've coated any prune branches to prevent the entry of termites or beetles within the plant and then it's offering as we already said protection against the extremes of Sun whether it be winter or summer but what I want to show you here is take a look at the leaves you can see on this side we're getting Sun this is the southern side of the point on the northern side of the plant most of those leaves are in the shade we're approaching near the end of the day and the Sun is on its way down and again being on a hillside we're we've lost at least an extra hour or two of Sun with otherwise being joining but we're about thirty to sixty days away from the Sun getting a little higher in the sky as we enter the warmer months of Fabio we're in March and everything's gonna wake up and begin performing excellently so my point here is if I put this container on the south side of the plant I will benefit more light than if I put it on the north side of the plant where I would actually end up in too much shade it would affect the productivity of the fruiting blueberry blueberries also can tolerate some shade better than other fruit trees so I have seen a lot of blueberries thriving excellently under the canopy of other plants but considering that when positioning it a rounder tree that you're gonna want to put it on the south side of the tree moreso than on the north side of the plant I hope I've made that on that point clear the next thing we're going to do is we're going to put the container in the ground we're not going to set it on the ground we're gonna put it in we're actually going to bury it at least an inch or two under the ground and let me make my point here if we take for example some Reynolds Wrap and we put it here on the ground like so I can clear an area over here if I were to put this down like so and cover the corners up what would happen within a few short minutes is it would begin to fog up and that fog is basically the moisture under the ground trying to get out the entire soil your entire backyard is breathing even in the hottest and driest of months there's typically moisture still under the ground that's being released and given off through the surface so the goal by positioning your container into the ground rather than for those of you that have to put it on your deck or your porch or on a concrete surface it'll reap the benefit of those days that you're away from home or or you've got an automatic system that's not functioning but it'll actually be better rounded in regards to making sure that the plants is watered and in between left to dry but as also Tom Spellman said never bone-dry so the goal is you want it to when you water make sure you soak the entire soil medium and allow that water to get out quickly and that's again depending on the soil mix that we're gonna use which we're going to talk about shortly and the goal is to make sure that it's dry between waterings but never to the point that there's no moisture at all in the soil but to prevent the risk of no moisture in the soil by positioning it in the ground there's still going to be some moisture from the ground that's gonna penetrate through these holes and basically offer moisture into the growing pot and as you can see over here there's an apple tree that have done exactly that and that's the reason that a lot of my pots here in the garden are all buried a couple of inches into the ground as you can see over here and that helps round the the basically making sure that there's always moisture within the pot even when you may have missed the exact or the better day for watering the plant well let's get started now so the first of two position I've already decided where these containers are going is one is going to be going in this area over here roughly and right now we've got a lemon verbena I've got cuttings off of this where I'll be rejuvenating and planning it again in the spring and then I've got this apple tree in a pot which we've grafted we've done an educational video on grafting apple trees but you can see over here I'll share with you again this here is coated with the eye of organics we can apply some more ivory organics to protect the graft as you can see there's a lot of exposed in open areas of wood and coating it will help protect on the entryway of a lot of pests from entering and possibly damaging the graph in this area and the second one is going to be going if you can back up a couple of inches you can see that we've got over here some Swiss chard but I basically want to position it somewhere right here in the middle so I'm going to harvest the Swiss chard as well so it doesn't go to waste we'll make an excellent salad out of that for later today and we're basically going to have these pots doesn't look right now but we're going to line them up in this area where it'll capture the light between as the Sun rises to set they'll always be light coming in between the two trees as long as I manage and prune these trees into its respective position these blueberries will be capturing the sunlight between the plants enjoying a little bit of filtered light which is okay and blueberries thrive and enjoy that it's gonna have no competition with other trees as its in its own container and in its own soil and it's we're gonna feed in and make sure that it's very well nourished as well so let's get started with that the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna clear this area so the next step is we're going to now reduce the soil level by about an inch or two to make room put spot if you can see over here we're about an inch maybe below the soil I'm not gonna just fat fill it around the pot like so this sprinkler that's in this position over here will raise to about the height of the container that'll then spray in this direction it'll hit the bush and drop a lot of moisture that way and we're also gonna have to periodically visit the plant and maybe even hand water or we can come up with a drip system where you know saturate and soak this entire area the one thing I don't like about a drip system just to let you know is that it sometimes just wad is one side of the plant you got to basically come up with a method of watering the entire area of the plant especially the surface as the majority of the roots are going to be in the upper sixes to a foot and the goal is to make sure that all of it is saturated and soaked with water so we're gonna come up with a better system for irrigation so again that might be a future video that we'll discuss but right now I know I'm blocking the sprinkler I'm gonna deal with this after the video now to make sure we've got fast draining soil one of the first and the key steps to making sure we've got good drainage is to add some gravel some rocks and if you've got some broken clay pieces this is another excellent product to use something you should not be doing for your potted plants is using wood chips which are plentiful here in our garden is we've used this to basically you know insulate the soil there's a lot of benefits which I'm not going to get into in this video but by putting this at the bottom of your pot these wood chips are going to end up robbing the soil of a lot of the nutrients specifically nitrogen and it's also could potentially contribute towards the broth especially when there's too much moisture in there so the better alternative for accomplishing good drainage in a healthy way is he is crush rock so this is what we're having here and we can even take our clay pieces as well I'm just basically gonna scatter those like so so the next step is soil I picked over here this product at the local nursery which has raised bed and potting mix this is critical um and the other thing I was looking for also as a product that was not enriched with chemical fertilizers there's a lot of products out there that says you know potting soil with six months of feed that's a big negative if you take a look at the percentages and also the contents of this product let's turn that around let's take a look at what it's made out of and you should be doing this was pretty much all of your products if you take a look over here it's only got point oh one percent nitrogen or over here it's actually 0.3 percent nitrogen of a percent which is like not even one percent point one percent of phosphate and here's some potage point one percent and then it derived from high hydrated poultry manure so basically chicken manure hydrolyzed feather meals kelp meal bat guano and ferrous sulfate um when it comes to and you can take a look in here you can see all of these white specks in here all of those white are basically perlite and you can also see this you know some wood chips in there you can see all of the organic matter that's in there but there may be too much organic matter in here the expert that I'm gonna get hopefully as the speaker for us within the next month or two is Gary at the Laguna Hills nursery and Tustin I believe or Santa Anas right on the border but Gary's gonna discuss soil and what makes a perfect soil naturally in the environment where most of these plants you can even say where they grow natively and and naturally will be soil that is not a hundred percent organic entirely made out of all of these organic compounds but rather be somewhere as high as 90 to 98 percent in organic matter such as clay such as sand such as silt that actually makes up the majority of soil by putting this much organic most of this is gonna turn into dust over the next year or two and it's going to result in a plant that's settled significantly and substantially so Gary's gonna talk about a formula that's even superior to some of these plant soils that you'll find on your nursery where it's based on more inorganic matter and then basically improved with the right components of organic matter and I'm gonna have him better explain it but what I'm gonna do to improve this condition of potting soil and one other thing I want to make is a point on potting soil is do not put potting soil in the ground by doing so this specific formula and any potting soil is specifically designed to retain moisture I know the goal is to create something that's fast flowing and and dries quickly but if potting soil is designed to do exactly that allow for faster a nudge there's typically also sand that might be added to also help improve the drainage as well of soil or your potting soil specifically but adding something like this where it says potting soil to your soil will actually result in your earth and the plants around it absorbing too much water as this is designed to basically retain water between the waterings in a container hence the word potting mix so again do not put potting mix in your soil and again doing these your soil mixes in your pots as again they're specifically designed and formulated to do and perform best in the conditions that they're designed and created to do but what I'm going to do again now to improve this is first I'm going to put a couple of handfuls near the base so if you want to follow me and watch me fill this container up I'm just gonna put about an inch or two of this potting mix into the pot and then as we discuss all of this whiteness that you see in here is this product over here which is called perlite this is an old bag but perlite and hopefully can read through all of this you know this age bag over here says help prevent soil compaction promote strong root development and excellent for starting cuttings and if you take a look at this product and again this is pure white what it does is it helps one retain water and at the same time it also helps with drainage it kind of serves like two functions and one product but I like adding I would say um about a third extra to whatever I've added at the base whatever we did to the base we're gonna do to the top as well and I'm basically gonna mix that perlite into that potting soil and you can see that it's a lot more white and the benefit of this is it's going to help that much more with drainage another product that works good but perlite is still my preference is this and this product makes it into a lot of potting soils as well is known as vermiculite and again let's talk about the benefits of vermiculite improves moisture and nutrient retention aids faster seed germination prevents soil compaction you can see it's pretty similar to what we've just read about perlite we can take a look at the kind of looks like fool's gold in color and you can add that as well but again my focus is not so much on vermiculite as much it is on perlite so again I'm not telling you to buy both products but I do strongly recommend the addition of more perlite towards the base as well as in the topsoil and well that's going to do is help one with the drainage - by adding it near the top it's going to help prevent stem rot and root rot to the point and we're gonna continue forward with that now that we've created a really good base soil we're just going to now fill it up to the level where we want this container plant to be which is just about an inch below the rim of this pot so let's continue adding some more soil so here we are now I believe you've got the soil at the right level we'll basically here put the pot one more time in here if I were to err you know the goal as I said is to create about a rim with about an inch of space to basically once I water I can saturate and soak it with water um but if I were to err I can go a little bit higher as I know that the soil is going to eventually break down as it's got so much organics in it what you can also do as putting it in is you can also compact the soil a little bit you can just go with your pump and press down on so they can feel like there's a lot of air which is a plus but you might want to compact it a little bit so it doesn't give immediately after your water that it that um that it basically settles significantly more but you can have a little bit of pressure I'm not recommending you put a lot as you can see I'm just basically patting it with one hand to basically fill in any air pockets that may exist at this point so far we're gonna repeat it one more time once we fill it up to the level the desired level so I'm gonna put the plant in here again and you can see we've got a pretty good height I'm like really close to the rim of the container but I know it's gonna settle some so I'm okay with that right now and then when removing the plant and just take a look again where we are this here is the first container the point of view in my garden is from a seating area that's about 10 20 feet behind you and I like looking in when it comes to the height my goal is I want to have the higher plankton I'm glad we talked about this because I got this reversed this year in front of me is the Missy that grows four to six feet compared to behind me is that sunshine blue that only grows on average between two to three feet so I want the shorter one up here so we're going to reverse and put the misty behind me where I'm gonna have the height so you can just imagine that this is the plant that it's going to be standing taller like up in and you know you can kind of visualize that it's going to kind of fill up this growing zone this area between the two trees and then I'm gonna have a smaller more compact blueberry bush in this area and what I'd now so here we are now we've pretty much positioned the blueberry into the container we're looking at the height the other thing I want to share with you is a matter of perspective I told you everything's appointed views and there's a little bit of not a lot of horticultural and plant design that's going behind this as well we did our research to find out which one's going to grow taller which one's going to be shorter which one's gonna be Bush here which one's gonna be linked here and you've got a four see how that's gonna fit in your garden with you being the point of view into this garden and as you can see that wall behind me it marks in my property boundary and I'm putting my tallest stuff in that area at least in the long term as you saw this banana that's in front of me um that's really tall I put you know over here a medium sized three and one apple tree which I'm going to share with you momentarily and then behind that a fig tree that I'll be reaching 15 to 25 feet as well my bananas I'm still in the process of selecting my favorite of the three varieties and then I'll narrow it down to possibly wanted to so there's always a little bit of experiment happening in this garden from year to year so when it comes to design being that I've got my sunshine blue here in front of me this one has bee research will grow about 2 to 3 feet so the goal is this is gonna fit in a growing area that's gonna be somewhere up in this area whereas the misty variety we know is gonna grow 4 to 6 feet I stand 6 feet tall so we're talking about a bush that's gonna be filling in this growing zone between these trees and capturing that light that's above me so we're gonna have basically something that's gonna be a pyramid growth with more height in this area and shorter as you get closer to you so that's the design that we're going to be you know striving for and we're gonna be pruning in accordance with that as well and you're gonna be there to join us as we go throughout the year and work on other demonstrations and projects throughout the garden so let's take a look now at this we've just put it in one other thing I want to share with you when I selected this blueberry variety if you come in a little closer as well as the so this here's the sunshine blue variety the other one we also picked up is the misty but what I'm looking at and the reason I picked this one over the other varieties is is it had a lot of stems near basse I can see over here I've got one two three four five stems coming off the base ground and it also had a lot more thickness and a lot more bigger than the other varieties and that's the reason this one here was selected over the other varieties and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna remove it from the container I like basically positioning my hand on top to basically secure the topsoil in place to minimize stress to the plant give the base a couple of taps like that and I can now remove the container like so I'm now going to inspect the roots to make sure that there isn't any any overcrowding happening with the root system I like to typically remove and basically wake up the base of the roots if there's any circling happening with the roots you may want to prune those out carefully or untangle them gently and you can take a look at the roots that also made it out to the side of the container and you can kind of just rub your fingers along the side to basically wake up the roots and let it know that it's no longer in the container and that it's free to now reach its roots out into the rest of the container and now we're just basically going to position it in the direction that we want it to be and now we're going to basically backfill it with some more potting mix so once you got to that last inch or two if you come in a little closer you can still see that this is the shape of the container right here around my hands we pretty much back filled all of the soil around it we're adding a little bit of compaction as we work our way up you can see whether just our fingertips and then and the reason again for adding some compaction is to make sure that there aren't any air bubbles within the soil near the roots that could potentially be drawing out the roots we want to make sure the roots are in contact with the soil and some moisture and not into any air pockets where those roots that are exposed to the air could potentially dry out so once we get to that top entra - what I like doing is basically adding as we did towards the base some more perlite so what we're gonna do is just add about another couple of cups and the goal is that I'm trying to achieve about a 1/3 to 1/4 perlite per whatever that potting mix is to basically increase aeration to increase drainage and to prevent as we already mentioned the risk of stem rot and root rot that should be sufficient if you take a look down here now you can see all the perlite that we've got and now we're just gonna mix that into the potting mix to basically create something that's even got more drainage than it otherwise would be alone and now we can use this mixture as the final backflow I think we got it the goal again I can feel this is the surface of the of the soil that it was in the pot and the goal is to make sure that it's in line with the backfill soil that we've added so that we make sure again that we're not adding too much soil above the level that it was in follows in the container so you're going to want to make sure that that same soil level that it was in the container is happening within your pot as well so we're just gonna fill that in ratting a little bit more compression and then for those of you that already know blueberries there's one more secret and we already said it one is to make sure that we maximize on drainage and health but that second most important thing is that we have a very acidic soil let me correct that not necessarily very acidic but we just want to have a more of an acidic soil than an alkaline soil to accomplish acidity there's products such as this and I found this in my garage but this here is a product made by a spa organics they open that up here and then you can see it says soil acidifier and it says for organic gardening lowers soil pH lowering it makes it more acidic all natural pelletized safer than aluminum sulfate for blueberries and that's what we're doing right now and hydrangeas and without even reading the direction I'm not even going to add it's something like a couple plant or whatever you know based on size I'm simply just going to take about a handful because typically when it comes to fertilizing your plants especially at installation you don't really need to fertilize it and again being that it's also January there's not much happening within the plant even though you see all these beautiful blossoms if you want to come in a little closer so you can see how beautiful these flowers are these here are the blossoms of the plant and you can see over here these are the teeny tiny blueberries that it's already onset fruit to here's some more medium-size blueberries as well right in there so there is activity happening here but even though there's activity this is the most slowest time of the year for these plans as as they wake up and go into spring closer to spring is what are you gonna had a moderate amount of fertilizer by summer when the activity is peaking unit had the most according to the product label by fall you're gonna taper off and by winter as most plants we're gonna do nothing but this year is gonna help acidify the soil something else that you can do to naturally create the acidity within the plants as compost most of you organic compost that you've got as you can see I've got that bin over there behind me over my left shoulder but that compost bin also has a lot of organic matter and that organic matter is naturally acidic it can help benefit the soil so you can even use um you know your homemade compost to help create the city that will maximize the health and the vitality of your plants so another excellent additive for accomplishing the acidity of your soil is using a product such as this if you take a look says sphagnum moss or sphagnum peat moss and peat just simply means um you know basically composted moss so you can take a look what we're adding is some peat moss and peat moss is naturally acidic as well so if we basically add this to the potting mix you can see this I've already added a lot more perlite to the potting mix but that's another way to accomplish acidity and blueberries love it so the next step is watering your plants when watering and you can see I'm trying to saturate the soil as much as I can but it's so fast draining I can't even get it to accumulate on one side of the plant so I got to go all the way around the water the front the back the sides and all the way around so if you do for example a drip system and it's sitting on this side the water might be going straight through starting at the top and exiting the bottom and never saturating and and basically hydrating the whole back side of the plant so make sure when you water the water all the way around your plant that'll help activate all of the life within your potting soil and medium it also help invigorate the roots uniformly throughout the pot and the goal when watering is to make sure again when you do go to water your plant that you soak the soil you're gonna want to make sure that it's basically wet all the way from the top surface soil down to the very base you're gonna want it to basically leach going down to the soil that this is sitting on your concrete patio or your death then you're gonna wait for that water to basically come out if you've got a saucer allow the plant to basically hold that water in the saucer for maybe a day but do not allow that water to sit in that saucer for days on end as that will basically cause the entire soil to begin to rot you're gonna want it basically to soak and then immediately release and dry out but again as we said at the beginning not bone-dry we're gonna want to make sure that it's dry but never bone-dry between waterings the other lesson that we learned from Lisa Smith and that'll be another video that I'll post as well is when watering is to mimic rain when you got an irrigation system around your plane you don't just water when it rains on your plant it's not just watering one side of your plant its watering the entire growing zone that entire area around the plant so make sure you want an entire area very thoroughly so the last step we're gonna do here is we're gonna apply this product which is the IV organics three in one plant guard ready to use spray this is protection against damaging sunburn insects and rodents for use on your roses fruit nut trees ornamental trees and shrubs non-toxic environmentally safe and organic product I'll share with you the back as well where it basically talks about the active ingredients you can see here that's got castor oil and cinnamon and cloves and garlic peppermint rosemary and spearmint and then it's also got limestone which is a traditional way of whitewashing your plant mica is away other cultures used to whitewash the plants the milk and the silica and the iron oxide together help create protection that once sprayed on the leaves will help keep the plant cool on average for about two to three seasons what we're gonna do in applying it now is we're gonna help make sure that this plant stays cool where towards the end of the day but tomorrow we want to minimize that stress to the plant I'm gonna share a brochure with you in just a minute but what I'm gonna do is simply take this product make sure I thoroughly shake it and then I want you to watch as I apply this to the plant you can see that as I spray it what it does is create a light film of white as you can see over here like an organic white sun block to the leaves and that's gonna help keep the plant cooler and then that garlic and cinnamon and castor will also help keep the slugs and the other and grasshoppers and other pests from chewing on the leaves until the plant gets established and stronger and can until the plants defenses get strong enough to tolerate some abuse by other past as well as extremes in summer as well as winter but this product will help basically curb those extremes [Music] you may have noticed that between these two blueberries was this theory on one apple tree that i grafted it's actually one root they I basically pruned very short to create three suckers and each one of these suckers I basically grafted with three different varieties of apples from Granny Smith to a reddish green variety to a red variety so we've got green green red and red basically on one roof stock and is basically containing a very small area within our food forest here at home you may have noticed that this branch over here is coated with the ivory again it's color brown this one over here white and the one behind me green you can see it's available in all these different colors what I want to share with you is this can over here as you can see over here that it's also registered material for use in organic agriculture the benefits of the product here on the lid protection protects newly installed plants and trees shields pruned and damaged surfaces and we basically used it here on this apple tree that we recently defoliated to forest dormancy on this plant but we basically used it as a dormant spray on our deciduous trees within the garden so these two blueberries that we planted and added to our food forest here in the garden are my newest and my most favorite additions to the garden I hope you would agree as well if you found this video informative be sure to like it most importantly by subscribing down below you'll be connected to this and all of

a couple weeks now you could say but uh something I've been really excited for but before I get into that I wanted to show you guys update on this foil because that one gram that I had it went from being more of an oily texture to a straight-up butter texture like I don't know if it's really focused in or if you could see that but like it literally just breaks down and then crumbles up kind of like a hash wood and then it builds up a little bit on the diver so far so good but that right there is looking like a fat dab looking like a pretty fat dad actually so we'll dab on I'll just rest that on the box actually for the moment set this back up and [ __ ] yeah so we're going to get to that [ __ ] you take a quick dad and then we're going to open up that box and [ __ ] smoke a bowl because yes that's what in there is a bull and I'm sure a lot of you guys know if the glassblowers salt like recently I have come across a few of his pieces just slightly cheaper than normal and so overall when I seen one of them going for a price that I couldn't resist I just I had to take it and it's actually like a pretty sick decent-looking bull so I'm excited to open it up [ __ ] I had to pick up weed today even just specifically for it so yes I've had the box already for about few hours but picked up we'd just a bit even because diablo 3 is being released tonight so I gotta keep a little bit of money in my pocket but anyways like nails pretty much hot here we're going to take this damn and then we'll get into this box but I rat oh I guess I should close it down a little bit there you go cheers guys dabs are next yeah dabs are really next that's why I've got to be admitting like I'm enjoying doubted I'm enjoying that but ok now I've been really anxious to get into this like I'm really anxious so you're quicker is that anything to worry about just list ok time to be in [ __ ] see it's kind of funny even says salty haha so it's like okay but this dude packed it up like crazy [ __ ] this thing is taped up like a [ __ ] I'm going to need to grab a knife of this give me two seconds here just go grab a plate why not I just gotta hope I don't [ __ ] dig in too far that it breaks it or anything I hit really don't want anything like that happen but so far let's see because this thing is so far really taped up like holy [ __ ] like when I do they shipping bomb from a bomb-proof he's really shipping bumper well okay seems like we're getting progress yeah no progress almost get wet now i'm getting messaged on skype even like yeah quickly i'm just gonna check this [ __ ] that's actually coming from end zone oh by the way shout out to end zone he's actually the guy who helped me [ __ ] it well guided me through making the butter dish it I'm sorry I'm sorry for the loud typing but ok now we get back to this trying to get this [ __ ] lil there like this thing is actually really packed up well like packed up real well but [ __ ] it so much tape like it could have been done with less tape you know what I'm homos pass this one layer of tape in the spot just continue this and it will just break as a bubble wrap fold wrap is a [ __ ] a lot easier to get here so far and [ __ ] this is taking a little bit longer than I've expected guys so I'm sorry if the video is a bit long oh [ __ ] okay so we got more bubble wrap inside the bubble wrap with more tape the one thing I was trying to avoid I [ __ ] end up getting hit with more that's son of a [ __ ] but ok let's see cuz it was like a hole there that I could've got into but it's not enough not enough almost almost got it up almost oh my god ok Annie unwrapping it's actually such a small ball I was not expecting it to be so small but anyways guys it's so tidy actually like legitimately but [ __ ] it it's kind of crazy cuz I don't know if a lot of you guys know with how expensive salt pieces normally go for but even his Bulls sell for 200 bucks 300 bucks how some even go up to like 600 bucks and [ __ ] so I'm really excited to finally have a salt piece and this is actually really nice working less like I mean it's [ __ ] in all really thick glass you could feel the heaviness to it and [ __ ] Scott real small hole to it it's got hold on outside I should probably pull out the light you could probably definitely not actually but it's got on the inside of the bowl look in 2010 and then it's also got salt written on the other side you can kind of see it not too much though but you see it's naturally like a brownish color and it's got just a sick ass looking eyeball like it actually looks legit though hey wait it's [ __ ] dope I mean it doesn't want folkish why staring you down what's good it's good that just play but anyway [ __ ] you yeah that's really don't work and I thought that was going to be [ __ ] a little bit deeper in [ __ ] but that actually mean I bet it's kind of like just a little ol that'll be good too late grip onto and [ __ ] but uh it's kind of funny like the reason why I had got it so cheap is I don't really know if you could see but there's a small tiny itty bitty chip they're very very [ __ ] small chip back leg I barely even noticed it in the pictures and that was why I was enough for me to tolerate I said [ __ ] it and then yeah but uh and uh [ __ ] and I just realized I'm still not yet prepared because I ended up forgetting to grab my [ __ ] 18 to 14 adapter so [ __ ] my bad guys give me a moment here gotta run to my drawer fox6 I really should get prepared for videos before i go to do this [ __ ] whatever i go to do a video and i'm not prepared like this I feel like I'm making you guys just watch all this extra [ __ ] and [ __ ] in that reminds me I don't even have my b lasso bomb filled up with water at all you see I am moving way too slow way too slow I've been keeping the beat isobar so far in the right case that damn pad always falls out so I'm just throwing up there for long pull up the beat I don't eat the books i'm using my new right real quickly throw some water in here man I swear this video was taken way that I'm expected so far way longer but that's my bad guys my bad okay we're almost done here almost down okay that Bulls loaded this will be the first bull that I ever smoked through assault piece that's a loaded so bull [ __ ] dope I'm so far loving this thing like it's kind of cool how it's got a brownish red color to it and thats [ __ ] got like little purple it's just dumped there's so much color to it and design that you can't really see through the camera like it's intense but uh anyways it's been a long time [ __ ] since I've actually been like using the beautiful ball I've been using my custom piece for the longest time but gotta get ripping on this bull guy so this way you get this bit uploaded like I was not expecting it to be a 13 minute video pretty much so that's my bad guys my bad but there's also the release of t3 tonight / tomorrow and it's probably going to be a video within the next 24 hours so you probably end up seeing another one too but let's get this gun in the meantime let's break this bowling huh cheers that snaps bulls nicely I didn't really leave anything in that oh yeah good little snapper bowls that'll definitely definitely prevent me from smoking so much because I mean I normally packed fat bowls hey just that's a real small bowl like I mean I really don't know if you guys can see it but for instance against my hand it's a 14 millimeter by the way I'm just loving that eyeball and everything I salt dough but alright guys for the meantime though I gotta get out of here and get this bit uploaded so I'm out not out also still got quite a bit of oil but I'm out", "qdtZpjteg9c": "yo welcome to the THC spot thank you guys for

if you'd like to see some more have a good day this has been John with CNC connoisseurs peace", "mX8pvVaptjE": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is trippy Tuesday episode 52 today I am reviewing some taffy diamonds sauce truth Gold Coast's this is their new sauce line and they're calling it diamonds with a Z and it's really just because the THC a chunks in it are really really fat and you'll see that here in the the close-ups as I stir it up tangey is kind of actually subdued by the smell of this apni which is kind of like Afghani oh yeah really really getting that that earthy kind of earthy kind of firm kind of hashey taste along with the tangi funk from DNA which is undeniable and when I was handed this and I was like ah Tandy I don't know I almost asked her different flavor because I feel like tangi is gonna overpower especially in a sauce any other flavor that it's mixed with and this stuff is actually a really even 5050 I was I was really pleasantly surprised by it yeah yeah the tangi scent and and terpene profile is just not it's not overpowering oh but the smell is so dank it is just so so fire yeah I could say outright as far as just a super strong Afghani funk and I concentrate this stuff is probably the loudest I've ever smelled any Afghani it's just reeks out of control yeah just like a spicy not I mean yeah kind of a peppery earthy really funky Cushie taste that's the best way I could describe Afghani ever had a hindu kush it's kind of similar to that this one is yeah the blend of tangi and happy is so big it just smells so fire together when I got this sauce from the booth looks at the underside of this lid and realized that a bunch of the Terp liquid soap into the the styrofoam was like [ __ ] you know so I messaged Gold Coast and I was like hey you might want to have a look at this packaging is I think this is a the very very first drop a release of their sauce so they responded right away and they were like hey yeah we noticed we definitely noticed that straightaway and we changed all the lids so you don't have to worry about that happening to you but unfortunately I think I lost a little bit of the Terps to this lid however I'm still a super flavorful sauce and and really be at the visual appeal of the thca chunks is awesome right guys going in on my first AB here of the taffy diamonds live resin sauce from Gold Coast extracts here in California got them from the booth at a chalice yeah it was really cool meeting you guys seeing the whole crew there yeah I mean really Gold Coast is easily one of my favorite companies you guys stuff is always kill I mean I really I love the white Walker a level the the canopy otic slavers you guys run and really really looking forward to exploring more flavors in this new sauce line which is just killer cheers guys [Laughter] oh man the tangi squeeze yeah the chunkiness of this is really really cool and it's a nice visual reminder or indicator of how much THC a is going into your dab whereas with a couple sauces I bought recently are just so runny that for all I know it's pretty much just mostly Terps and I like there to be some THC in there for sure so if you can visually see that you're dabbing giant chunks of THC you know it's kind of a no-brainer the high will come and with this stuff it is definitely no brainer tangi and the after you which is a pure indica so I'm Amy the hybrid nature of it is such a harsh contrast it's just that it's got the up nature of the tangi and then the full body buzz of the athletes yeah and the flavor is really really unique which is something that I guess as someone who loves concentrates I mean I'm always looking for new flavors this one the taffy yeah keep an eye out for this Oh killer get another tab here going in on a second dab here guys of the taffy diamond sauce from Gold Coast this is their new sauce line Gold Coast live resin that the diamonds big giant chunks of THC a yeah really really killer flavors on this concentrate [Music] I don't know if I mentioned it before but the readings on this nail are maybe not quite accurate this nail has presets or for a lot of different Lee nails so this one this one has a preset but the Sapphire preset I was told by the developers the email needs a little bit more work so the temperature is not quite accurate I think also I have my coil on this leg or modified I stretched the spring coil I kind of stretched it out with pliers so that it fits onto this thing really snug and that really makes a difference on the temperature to you that makes about sixty degrees of temperature difference so in summary you can basically add about sixty degrees to whatever number you're seeing here on the screen and that is the approximate temperature of my dabbing situation so I get that question a lot what what temperature do you set your email to and it's like it's tough because this you know it's really like it's preset based to your specific email so it's kind of like well if you don't have this liger with the Sapphire insert then what I set my email to is completely different than what is probably gonna give you an ideal experience but yeah I try my best yeah the eye from this is very much the harsh unless a harsh mixture but like a harsh contrast of Tangie which is very much an uplifting sativa high of the citrus turkey and profile and in Skunk and then the the half knee which is very much indica definitely giving me that Afghani funky vibe and the mixture of the two yeah it's just as its knocked out it isn't instant buzz hmm Anna and the Indyk that kind of creeps on you too if you do a few dabs of it so yeah I would highly recommend this one to anybody if you see this I haven't seen it in San Diego yet the the Gold Coast sauce but yeah I really hope it gets down here soon the diamonds with the Z the diamond sauce is so fire man and the chunkiness of it too yeah it's really a joy to deal with and the nose on it it is it is something a lot of sauce and it's it's really a joy to see that coming from big-name companies yeah just really really killer stuff that's gonna wrap up this episode of Turkey Tuesday this has been episode 52 again reviewing the tapi diamond sauce I got from Gold Coast booth when I was at chalice festival melting out the desert yeah next year I'm hoping it is somewhere that is more air-conditioned like a giant convention hall or something yeah the Gold Coast had their own building and and their booth was really badass so it was really really awesome to get a hold of this stuff and try it out and so glad I did yeah it just killer sauce I'll see you guys next week thank you so much for tuning in to the CCC 420 peace [Music]", "vDz6bMTdPDE": "alright guys this is my second video figured I would do it over viola my man want to call every brand my favorite company but Buell is a pretty interesting one founded by a former NBA player al Harrington back in 2011 got its name because that's his grandmother's name she suffers from glaucoma and diabetes and reluctantly agreeing from a long time of him persuading her helped her a lot and she now medicates with his help from viola and cool story great company all butane extracts I have a nice little flavor assortment recent pickup from Denver big fan so I'm gonna run you through a couple of these flavors actually I'm gonna go through all of them just because I'm reviewing viola today so first we have tangerine hash plant now some of these I have written to two grams on them because I combined them so no yeah I'll say that this one is one of my favorites which I probably say about four of them super citrusy flavor definitely getting the tangerine flavor and I got three of them they're incredible I love tangerines but each each it's gonna be to each his own what you think ghosts domina that's gonna be a live sugar 98 percent THC a and that total totally THC 86 percent you gotta look at that big difference with that live sugar it's a it's pretty easy to work with ghosts domina my girlfriend said it was her favorite fantastic that's another one of the two grams and I've been I've been small a little bit of these because I couldn't I couldn't wait to make this video my pay my patience is not there yet this was cool it's a life crumble and my girlfriend rated all these I agree oh this one's number one sour bean it just smells like sour if you if you can understand what that like a Sour Patch Kid like kind of makes you want to wrinkle your nose up haven't try that one yet Mac cake one of my favorites obviously if I got two grams of it been hitting it already no mmm super pungent another sour flavor that's what I love about viola I'll say like I said many of my hey many of these companies are my favorites but they each specialize and have their own qualities violas especially is the pungently sour flavors [Music] another one is called extra citrus where's that one right here so this one tangerine hash plate and lemon Lotus and key lime pie combined to make extra citrus a 94% THC a I smoked a lot of this one because look at some of those big diamonds Wow smell is undescribable just extra citrus they named it well it smells like like just sniffing a lemon juice jar from the store this one's called THC a witch that's literally the name of the strain I guess is Kim for the wipers or is it just THC a camphor don't know big rocks smells pretty pungent fruity though very fruity very nice this is a smooth one pretty good no they're all pretty similar on those numbers live sugar try dog cush makes a triangle cushion underdog again pretty soon one little number yummy wondered on how to hit that one yet in five days eighty-eight percent that was a little lower total THC at seventy-seven but a little darker which lots of sauce very flavorful oh yeah that one's a little I want to say almost Darla key kinda sour garlicky moonshine haze fantastic [Applause] gorilla dog that's a huge one no no these oh that one smells so different like that's the it's it's just quite a spectrum and it's incredible how different the flavors can smell 83-73 so everyone knows that the higher the percentage I guess the less of the flavor and that one smacks me in the smack to me in the face with the 73% and makes sense yes this one's the last one to buy batter it's much a little bit of that one you can see it herbal like that hahaha but really good um I hope you've watched my video about the peak and its upgrades and I pretty much exclusively smoke out of the peak now which I know a lot of you guys are gonna roast me for it but hey we're gonna we're gonna do a little bit of this ghost domina blue that's the ghost domina and we're smoking on the fade space str2 unum nitride insert that's in my first video all about the upgrades of the peak and I'm gonna superheat it that's my method of superheating so much flavor again that was on blue the lowest heat setting I'm gonna begin on red or green even but yeah that's my man I guess what do you think I should try maybe some of the sour bean laughs crumble throw it in there on the second Heat we just add a little bit more flavor do it again Wow Wow al Harrington viola well done I'm in citrus paradise th citrus and there are so many flavors I could hardly pick I hope you'll enjoy it subscribe if you enjoy these", "zYVmywQcQMo": "between 1903 and 1905 near the silver mines in cobalt Ontario a very large yellow colored diamond roughly the size of a hen's egg was found by 1906 several news publications ran the story and named the stone the Nipissing diamond it was estimated the raw uncut gemstone was between seven and eight hundred carats in size which at the time made it one of the largest diamonds ever discovered the diamond was sent to New York to be cut by Tiffany and Co and shortly thereafter Tiffany sent an exploration team to an area west of Lake to miss coming to hunt for the expected source rock of the Nipissing diamond kimberlite however due to limited resources and technology in the early 1900's the trail went cold and no other diamonds were found the search for the Nipissing diamond was most recently resumed in 2014 when Tony Bishop decided to test a hypothesis that certain unusual circular shaped Lakes near Cobalt could represent the tops of kimberlite pipes with the help of his family the bishops conducted five years of extensive research and detailed prospecting finding diamond indicator minerals in a Down Ice glaciation pattern from his hypothesized kimberlite targets to understand the significance of these discoveries take a look at Canada's first diamond rush in the Northwest Territories in 1992 which actually began eight years prior with prospecting works similar to the Bishop family's diamond explorers used glaciation patterns to track diamond to indicator minerals in Reverse until they discovered the source kimberlite pipes now known as the Academy Vik diamond mines the results of the bishop family's work from 2014 to 2019 led them to identify 18 kimberlite targets for drilling as well as additional potential targets staked for continued exploration on February 5th 2019 rjk explorations signed a deal with Tony Bishop for the rights to the Bishop family's exploration claims none of the identified kimberlite targets have been drilled before and all are located near the very same land where it's theorized the Nipissing diamond was found most diamond exploration zones in Canada are very remote but our Bishop claims have power lines and existing timber roads throughout the property our land is situated in an under explored area near one of the richest mining camps in the history of Canada in addition there were already dozens of discovered kimberlite pipes some diamond if Aris north of the bishop claim boundaries but no company has yet to discover the source rock of the Nipissing diamond at our JK explorations we are actively working with the bishop family to write our own conclusion to the story of the 800 karat yellow Nipissing diamond in the hopes of replicating the success of previous great diamond explorers in Canada", "KH011aczvvY": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'll change back again for another concentrate review today actually riding solo this time but I just thought I'd come through take couple dabs of the gas see what's good with this raw garden and farm cookies I don't think I need to talk too much about cookies warm cookies obviously as many you guys know is the form cut from way back in the icy mag days but you know obviously we've been smoking cookies for quite a long time done a ton reviews on this one on delve too much into that side of it raw garden is somebody that you know you've been seeing a lot on the scene in California the last year too especially for the live resin especially below and are not necessarily low in but the budget stuff I know we do a lot of crazy concentrate reviews sometimes you guys are asking us to you know go find the hypest [ __ ] that we can find and review it whatever the you know crazy new [ __ ] is sometimes you know some people just want to see good deals stuff that's affordable you know I mean so we're trying to review stuff that kind of hits you know all levels of the spectrum this stuff right here as we go open it up good color right away I mean as as is typical with the most live residents usually gonna be a pretty light color it's not always you know what I'm gonna go on as far as you know appearance with with some wide but going in on the nose here it's actually sweeter than I was expecting it's it's kind of really sweet not as much of the cookie thing in there it's not you know doughy it's not doesn't have that that cookie funk that you know we've all become accustomed to but it's definitely a little bit sweeter than I'm used to for form compete yeah that's interesting I'm excited to see what it dabs like so this stuff is you know a single source whole plant run I'm pretty sure it's clean green certified and obviously whatever that means these days you know a pretty basic packaging just comes on a little box with a childproof jar inside on the side says 100% raw cannabis keep refrigerated or frozen clean green certified your single source grown and extracted for you recommended use vaporize at low temps it also says the score the fridge which is uh good advice see this nails heating up here raw garden I want to say they've been around for a while I wanna say 2012 may be 2011 so they definitely been in a game for a minute I never really you know saw them you know really take off until they started doing this this live resin a year to go and like I say for the budget stuff for if you're looking for you know maybe not the most exotic maybe not the most flavorful but good bang for your buck as far as you know actually getting you high I feel like they're usually pretty good bet obviously the flavor on some of these can be hit and miss but in general you really can't go wrong on cookies I want to see what it tastes like [Music] okay there's a little cookie tube in there a little bit it's again a lot sweeter like I was thinking with going with the smell the taste is is sweet like I was expecting I definitely got a little bit more of that cookie kind of hint on the flavor than I did with the smell it's almost like a little earthy afterwards I don't know it definitely does leave you an interesting aftertaste on YouTube so I'll be right back I guess I'm going to need a checklist for these videos from now on I usually get all my [ __ ] together and double and triple-check but somehow I forget q-tips nine times out of ten the prior being a STONER I guess yes you know I'm off the first dab you know I'd say it's pretty good not really feeling a super immediate head change I think we need one more really capture the full effect but uh Jerry and Batman seem to be feeling it [Music] Aurum cookies are really any cookies in general is something that you know is always kind of a staple for me because it's generally something that you can smoke pretty much any time of the day morning noon or night obviously that's why it's been a staple a lot of people's you know smoke stash for quite a few years now I feel like it's just it's just a good working high you know I mean you can you smoke it you feel it but it doesn't make me want to lay on the couch necessarily it doesn't make you want to get up and run around the block necessarily either but you know I mean just burn everyday smoke you know being able to rotate through all the different cookie cuts that are out there is never a bad thing alright let's go down another one here I'm gonna take this one a little hotter just for fun I'm gonna do that Cheers [Music] that might be a bad idea that one was a little rough I feel like you got the job done I'm definitely feeling the head change now in general this raw garden stuff or any you know cheap budget oil which is what I would call this this stuff was let's see 35 bucks a gram so I mean depending on what state you're living in now prices are all over the place that could be a breezy expensive if you're living in a couple of sticks that could be super cheap if you're living in other states and I mean for out here for 35 bucks a gram I feel like with most things you just got to have a good eye about it I mean you got to pick and choose so all in all I'd say you know it's not the the best libraries and I've ever had I'd say this particular batch you know it's decent for paying 35 bucks a gram especially for out here you know obviously markets and these different legal states are all over the place right now so 35 bucks might be kind of steep or super cheap depending on where you're at but you know for 35 bucks out here I feel like bang for your buck it's a pretty good deal all right I'm lit up like a [ __ ] Christmas tree I need to get out of here thank you guys for joining me for another episode of the CCC I'm ashamed [Music]", "TMAAuk38imQ": "and I am NOT gonna put up the team harming a shout out this week but on this call I know we have one new emerald miss Jen H congratulations yay yay we have a brand-new Sparky dymond miss a fabu if I'm in the house you know in case you didn't know whenever you hit diamond you get added to an extra special team harmony group it's just for spells um and above um but and then because a fab is diamond we have a new star diamond qualifier Alison Alison Alison this is the most ridiculous six weeks of life so for those of you that don't know about yet Carrie so for those of you that don't know what qualifying is in order to achieve a start time star diamond rank your personally sponsored diamond must hold their rank for six consecutive weeks so in order for Alison to be star diamond official on march 26 what somebody's flying that day lots of people I don't what are you talking about I don't know anyways taking sick days and what what nobody's going to Denver no um anyways so for Alison to become an official one star diamond I'm March 26 a fab has the extreme challenge pressure put upon her to not drop out of diamonds until then so she used to hold it um luckily when you go star down and qualify and you already have your first week in so it's it's it's very very challenging yeah no pressure if F none none zero I am checking their drill downs like crazy I check sponsorship drill down probably four times a day just be I'm obsessive and want to make sure that everybody is where they're supposed to be and check in on people and make sure everything's as is aah houssem as full of pressure on but i do not do what i did and qualify for 20 weeks out of 52 that's probably the dumbest thing you can do and that was just for two star diamond that was dumb I didn't check my drill down enough and on the very last day of the sixth week I missed something so yeah that was fun yeah yeah not cool but let it go let it go and i think mandy was talking about it in the new coach group i posted a gem for you guys it's in a post though you have to watch it unless you want to see it right now it's really stupid video maybe I'll show it to you at the end if you stick with me it's probably my favorite okay so congratulations to everybody this week is a huge week um our volume this week isn't quite where it's at where it has been the rest of the month but it's the end of the month so I know there are a lot of coaches who are so close to hitting a success Club so many to have two three four encourage your coaches check your downline make sure that they are pushing to hit success Club not just for the volume or anything that van does it feel good when you had success Club holy crap look here on did it you kind of like one punch something because you like keep that so um yeah its exact clone and if you have a coach that his hit success called like six months in a row and this month they're like I just I can't give them a good smack across the head and say you are six months away from All Stars get your butt in gear and hit it that's all i have to say do it okay sorry that's me being strange tonight anything else don't forget the 10 10 active coaches yeah yeah yeah yeahs Lee to qualify you have to have so many active coaches in order to for me to keep to star diamond qualifying I have to have six active coaches look at dub 12 active coaches they don't have to be all on the same leg for have to be on one you can have the rest on the other that doesn't matter um I struggle to keep six I struggle to keep six on each leg oh dear lord please just order your Shakeology to do it just so I was like go on because now I lose my rank which I really care about but it can be very frustrating when your qualifying so okay so tonight I was um you could just go see in the team harmony group I posted a picture i think it was yesterday of two emails that i got after i went to bed based on a blog post that I wrote about p90x3 now sometimes I want to gouge my eyes out for writing that post because the people that email me about it are people going I don't understand the plan f I've to eat 3,000 calories can you make a meal plan for me I like you for real but it's nice because I just got to new customers from that blog post so what I want to do tonight is I have in that blog post the show too and then show you how to set up a wushu form if you don't have a woot foo show you how to make one or you can also do a google forms which is what I kind of go back and forth between the two because with willful if you do a free account you can only have so many questions but Google Forms you can have as many questions you want and then you can actually embed that in your blog post so the form is right in your blog post stuff i am going to screen share with you guys um how am I get my computer is more likely or I'm just crazy that piece probably the more correct answer and share the interweb you can see my shutterfly my husband has me ordering pictures just like it like our pictures they're wonderful they're wonderful pictures yes yes actually it's of our bond because Jay get 101 first shutterfly prints through tonight check it out 100 free one-on-one free ones um but I'm being very scattered this evening so I'm going to go to my blog and i'm going to show you guys oh I'm signed in with the wrong account Kelly Elizabeth every day sign out sign back and with this one I wish google would let me switch my blogger over to my new email account but I haven't figured out how to do that yet so her here we go so I'm going to check out my learning to love me blog and on here the one that gets a ton of hit Ton Ton Ton Ton Ton Ton of hits is my p90x3 and that is actually from 2014 and I want to say it is from so be ready maybe anyway we're going to look we'll find it we find a bad boy no that's the fix fix fix feenin extra calendared let's group what would be a lot easier I find smart about this p90x3 meal plan examples so let's check this file this is what I'm talking about so I wrote this on January sixteenth and all it is is someone asked me to help him with an eating plan I said okay of course I'll help now he was 255 pound man who is in the f um block so what I have is I have the formula right there and basically how to add in figure out your calories so this guy was on the meal plan at from what i did is i did a meal plan of B so this is what you're supposed to have two proteins three carbs like you're supposed to have one two three four five six proteins those carbs and fats so I did an example of what you would eat and then I did a meal plan for F and I did the same thing so literally that's all I have there um so what people do is they go in here and I even know where I put contact me apparently it's in here somewhere um and they find my email somehow and they email me and ask for help which is pretty darn awesome I've got lots of comments on the air this is one of my better ones so maybe they come up here to contact me when they contact me if I was smart I would go back in and edit this and put a link to contact me for help with your meal plan okay so that's really simple to do and I actually probably will do that I'll make a little graphic that will sit contact me so people come in they contact me blah blah blah blah blah and ask for help so that's that one now another blog post this one is my most blogged or my most repinned blog post um and I very simple pictures but the water marked and then I I get with p90x piatti actually meal plan plan B meal plan plan ask me I'll plan an x3 meal plan so people on the web or checking if that's what they're searching for p90x free meal plan probably my blog is going to come up for them another one that I get a lot and this goes way back to where is that sucker that it's not there ah hey this okay from wha 2014 we were doing the t25 booty 25 last year we did a t25 group Nancy have 800 hits on this which is pretty good so what I did is there I did a little review here and then I was talking about how t25 is on sale and how we were going to run a challenge group but I have amanda's before and after their and her before and after and then I have some other people and some other people and Deidre's and if you look right here I invite people to fill out my challenge test group application and right here I can fill in all their information and they hit submit and it sends me an email saying that these people want to this person wants to be part of my group so this and I did this one through blue food forms so this is what I'm going to show you guys how to do tonight and then there's another version of the same thing which is I did actually got to be here 21 day fix VIP group which is I did this one through google docs through google form so it looks a little bit different but i can have unlimited questions in this one so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through and the place you want to go if you want to do a woeful form it's you www UFO wfo Oh calm wufu calm as you get into woof ooh it's going to say hi hi hi sign up sign up and you know what I'm going to sign up with a new account so i can show you guys what it is exactly from the beginning okay so we're going to sign up for a free account I'm gonna put in Kelly beer and gmail.com ah my account URL so this will be Kelly veer that free create account Kelly Lovera true food.com eat my hopes that's already taken okay so there we go okay so just use a different email address because apparently i use that one already alright so you jump in and it says hey you don't have any forms let's make one so there's forms reports themes users you can get into that stuff later the themes are kind of fun but we'll just talk about the forms right now so what we're going to do is we're going to make a new form so here's your new form and what you can do is you could be fancy pants they have fancy pants ones or they have standards so I'm gonna go in and ask people this my form is going to be did you see how I did that wait wait wait let's go back and field get rid of that okay so let's title the form first once you go in I feel see I clicked right here it says untitled form is my form fill it out it's awesome okay untitled form so I'm going to go over here i'm going to change the title to join join join team army okay this is my form fill it out it's awesome that's not going to fly um if you would like to join to be a coach on Kim on me and be considered for our new challenger to coach training please fill out this form okay and label placement top align left align blah blah you can do all that if you want so confirmation up um we can email them a confirmation nothing you can send them a it'll show a text when they're done thanks for it hates me ok it's not let it customized confirmation that's an upgrade okay see I can't up unless I want to pay for it with a premium account I can't do that so I'm not upgrading that's good for me um not giving anything like that so there you go that's what that looks like right now so what we're gonna do is we're going to add a field so I want the person's name dad has to be there so when I click on that see how I did that you go over here at a field and I'm going to click on fancy pants because I think fancy pants is fun that's just fun fun name they're gonna click on name and I'm going to come over here and you're like okay great well what if I want to make this a requirement because right now it's not a requirement so if you mouse over it it's going to say click to edit or drag to reorder so I'm going to click on it and it turns blue and the blue form pops up on the side so named options required that means they must fill this in first and last okay must fill it in they must see it okay perfect great awesome right great so now there's a required form in order to get out of that I once that's a field setting so I just went back to add a field so I'm going to add another field what I'm going to do is I need their email address that's the next thing I need okay you collect every single person's email address i'm gonna go over here click on it make it required and no duplicates check that out that's a new feature so you can't have someone you know apply to be on the team twice if they already slide then they already applied you don't have to do that you can if you want you can also type instructions for the user and there we go so their email know what I'm also going to do is I'm also going to ask for that phone number maybe if I had unlimited forms I'd probably do that so their phone number um it needs to be required that's so i can text them if need be alright so we're going to go here to multiple choice and i'm going to add a multiple choice do you already work with a beach body coach first choice VES second choice is going to be no third choices I'm not sure okay it is required and there we go do something fancy with this one mmm I can't do fancy with family so tough month I lied I'm great so we're going to go to another one um oh wait I don't want that then delete that did you see I added this field here this multiple choice decided I didn't want it so I just clicked on it and see the little minus that comes up right there I can delete that bad boy leaving him don't say see you later dude I am going to do a paragraph text because what I'm going to do is I'm going to say why do you want to be a coach on team harmony okay tell me why you want to be a coach there you go okay awesome I'm going to add a checkbox one okay go down here do you own any Beachbody workout workout programs check boxes so first column is going to be t24 hold you 21 day fix that is the most popular second choice is going to be on t25 third choice is going to be insanity and apparently I can't add anymore with this maybe I can't always again insanity p90x p90x2 p90x3 p90 guys will do the p 90 s will do insanity um asylum or insanity max 30 okay i'm going to add another one and i'm going to put it chili shrimp I Oh what else brazil butt lift aight i like tapping but brazil butt lift um then I'm sure there are other ones but make that required and the nice thing about the check boxes is they can add more than one alright so they they can check they owned more than that or a 21 day fix yeah and I don't like the way two cones looks three looks ridiculous so we're just going to do one right perfect this is really good question to ask people have you completed the Beachbody program that you that's a mouse get rid of that third choice um multiple choice here's another one this is another question you want to make sure you ask people do you currently drink Shakeology yes or no Oh shush stay on this page okay so um multiple choice here we go one more how how much time third day do you have to commit to working your Beach business okay first choice is going to be 10 how many aha how much time leaked these really do per week so we're going to say five to 10 when I say less than 10 hours we're going to say 10 to 20 hours and we're going to say 20-plus hours guide that should give us a good idea of where people are right there if you guys are chatting I can't see it so I'm sorry anybody needs anything next we should yeah okay Wow yeah everybody seems to be good so there we go i'm going to add another multiple choice because it's just the easiest what is the best way to contact you email text phone call okay and i think all you can do is 10 so let me see if i can add another one um yep yep you're limited to ten fields with the free one guy which is sometimes why i like to use google forms so not right now great so i added in just about everything that I needed to know right there and that is my form so I'm going to save my form I know that seems like rocket science I've made a form before and not say it so what's great about this is it says awesome your form is saved what do you want to do continue editing setup email notifications or take you back I'm going to show you how to set up email notifications it's super easy they ask you what email address do you want this to go to okay you can have it go um you can have a go to whatever email you want set reply no reply to new entries not your comments or you can do have it text you whenever you're whenever a form is sent through I used to only have 50 texts a month up until like a couple months ago so I never did that now we have unlimited so I'm like hashtag all the tech oh yes I said hashtag did you know one of my 5th graders called a sharp a hashtag like I have failed you as your music future I have failed you and then I go hashtag spinner sharp since the 1500s we win and they look at me like i'm on crack just fine okay so great so we're going to save my customers eight customization I can't even talk so what I'm going to do is now I'm going to go up here to forms I'm just going to click on that so you can see join Team hartney that's one of my forms now you get three forms total with a free account okay so the nice thing is you can go in and look at the entries see who has filled it out no one has filled it out analytics view notifications rules what I don't understand what the rules are create a world hmm I have no idea what that even means so you can figure that out and around and let me know how's that sound not going to waste your time you doing now now this little button right here see the share guy the share gun makes you happy share guys what we want to do so we're going to go in here and click on share and you can have a permanent link to your form a short link or we can see this little guy in bed or look wordpress if you have yours on WordPress your blog on WordPress they have a special button for you we are just going to embed this sucker so I go down and I use the iframe one because it puts it it says use this iframe embed code to place your form onto your page on your own site um where JavaScript might be unavailable so I always use this one so I just go there and I have an apple so come and see Apple see and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my blog and I'm gonna pick something stupid here is one that I never what are the differences hey great look I have some graphics up that's my differences that's it okay that's as far as I got so let's say I want to put my form right in here you do not paste that right there that is not what you want to do in order to embed you need to have some knowledge of HTML this is what Bethenny was talking about the other night so you're going to go in here to HTML and literally how I learned how to do this as I was like okay that's talking about text and Infante and okay what are the differences between the 21 day fix and fix extreme if you look back here that's right there okay what this stuff is saying that you want the font size to be large and you want it to be bold down here the 21 day fix extreme launched well blah blah blah blah okay see that now what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit enter a whole bunch of times and I'm going to go back to the HTML guess where my enters our can you see it this is all my enters this is all the space if you want to put something in its in a break so what I want to do is I'm to put my form right in the middle of that so I'm going to go there and I'm gonna hit Christ now is it ah height and width okay so what we're gonna do we're going to save this renew back to compose oh look that fits really nicely right there doesn't it see how it's the nice it's the whole wit some people they'll make it too wide no embed it so it's too long so what I want to show you guys if you look right over here and you have to look really carefully this is my I frame right here form that i just put in right here it says height 1293 if i wanted to make the form longer i would make that a bigger number here is the which it says look at that it says a hundred percent okay so it's going by percent not by pixels and stuff which is good because that means however wide the blog post is that's how wide the form will be alright so you click Save we're going to preview that sucker again and check that out what kind of nice and professional that looks isn't that awesome isn't that fun okay so there's that one does anybody before I go on does anyone have any questions on Lou foo feel free to unmute and ask any questions on blue foo roof I'm telling you forms are the way I just got to brand new on customers yesterday and I've gotten a couple of coaches that way and my blog works for me no questions no questions all right so what I'm going to do so I'm going to come in here and i'm going to delete that that really doesn't need to be there and i'm going to show you another way to do a form which is super dee duper easy so what I'm going to do I min at Google and I'm going to click on and go into my google Drive now my google Drive is ridiculously full you can way too much crap in here but what I'm going to do is you can look in applications and responses and that's where I have all my applications in response is saved so I'm going to click new and I'm going to go to Google I'm gonna say more and I'm going to go to google forms google forms is awesome okay so you can go in here and you can title the form form is this is not really something i'm gonna use okay i'm making it's a dumb form now you can title your questions as much as you want okay you can go down and do multiple choice checkboxes choose from a list datetime text this is pretty much the same as whoo folks just a different way to set up you can make a required question right here um right there you can add another um you can edit it you can duplicate it so let's add another item right there so now I have a question here's another one let's say this should be question 1 what Pierre and look at this the question for whoops okay we go break them I'm gonna go in here and i'm going to change this to paragraph text required question see how it has a little star by required awesome awesome ok oh ok let's add another item um this is question 2 X basic text required so I go in here and these are clearly out of order so all I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this and move it up and this is question for this to be question 2 i'm going to grab it and move it up super super simple and easy to do the confirmation page you can go ahead and type in your has been recorded or thank you for submitting this form I will be in contact with you soon blah blah blah blah blah and form now what this is going to do it's going to create another spreadsheet it's going to create a spreadsheet for you in the same folder that has your responses in it so we're going to send the form and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to you you can change the theme too if you don't like the theme you could do let's say you're you want to think about the beach it's just beach yay look it's a beachy theme we just need to drink in our hands that I can't have tell me yes um you can view responses and the responses are going to be in a spreadsheet okay now what else you're going to want to do is this is not something i'm going to use and here's the responses in order in will foo it told you right away let's check out your email notifications it doesn't in Google Forms you have to go to the responses and open it up and go up here to the top and click on is it dad I know form oh no i don't know- hang on the trigger words on it always takes me sick person if you see it and I don't see it just yell at me but I can't ring notification there it is see that's a weird one notification rules so you go in here notify me when a user submits a form and notify me right away so if you think you're going to get a lot you can do just a daily digest so you get one email a day or you can get an email anytime changes are made ok so that was I went to that was under tools and notification rules ok so that's how you set up your stuff with that you click Save and that's it and if you want to embed the form it's really simple and I'm gonna get out of here you can go up and we can send the form so what I'm going to do is I'm i hit i went to the form and i clicked send form now i'm going to go to embed alright so see right here the customized size is 760 by 500 you don't really know how big your form is going to be until you get it in there so I go in here I copy in iframe I'm going to go in here this is that same blog post I had before and I am going to post it like that this is what my google docs looks like okay now this is really annoying to me because number one do you see how it is wider than my frame here I can't stand that I think that's ridiculous and i also have to scroll I can't see the whole thing at once so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in here I'm going to change these numbers I want my height to be a thousand and I want my wits to be 500 and that's all I did Hey look at that okay and all of a sudden my entire form can be seen at once ok so that's really the best way to do it I think it looks more professional that way I think it's easier for people to see when you do it like that so it looks like this and I would probably go back in and make this bigger and make it look nice but when we were in the original it was 500 by what was at 760 and this is what it would look like when you saw it and to me it just doesn't cooperate see this you're gonna have to scroll here and I just don't think that looks very nice in fact I can't even get it to scroll so that's kind of annoying so that's why I would go in and make sure any HTML that you have the height where you need it to be and you have the width at 1g six hundred see how that looks might look better there we go you can preview that then you can see the whole form right there okay as it goes with Pinterest you guys can do this stuff through Pinterest pin your blog post about joining a challenge group pin you're in anything that has a form in there I never took down that coaching opportunity thing from last week oh yeah my brain is scattered but I'm gonna go in and delete that cuz i really don't more about there is just something stupid okay it's not stupid but there's a dumb phone that I don't need save that um go away from them get out of there I'm going to stop sharing real quick do you guys have any questions about Ruffo forms or Google Doc forms or how or why you should put them in seriously i got like I I get well if something is going on I have no idea i see Bridget cracking up and Jen's being a me can't even look at the screen I could tell the whole time I can see like Jenn and Michelle and Bridget and Bridget's gone giggles um do you guys have you guys have any questions on forms I know it can be boring for forms and all that kind of stuff but it really is important it makes you look very professional in your business to get that stuff up and going if you you know need help with it let me know i'll be happy to help as much as I can um my life is a slightly crazy Jen troublemaker know why we go I do have a question oh cuz I was taking notes okay do I have to have a blog like up and running to do these forms or can it have you can you don't have to have a blog you don't have to post them to a blog you cover you can say you know if you want to join my team fill out this link and let me open there you can go in just like where I found the embed code there's a sharing code okay that you can do and if you don't like the way it looks like if it's too long has a bunch of letters you can make a bit ly out of it okay that's what I've done with mine um join team harmony I think send you to carry to my to my link or to my forum but you don't have to have a blog to do a form which I could be nice yeah because I just started doing the like pages so I don't have the blog is like down the road and that's not a lot of help if I could use it yet here absolutely can okay Darwin definitely definitely definitely and Allison I have no idea why we thought it was five and I know it's 10 I know I'd like it to be more but i'm way too cheap to pay for the full full thing I pay for enough I'm good if a buffer account i don't use do you guys know what buffers buffer is like HootSuite is like son double it's a scheduler app where you can schedule your posts and I like Lee turns me on to buffer and I really really like it it's the simplest and prettiest and most basic there's no frill to it but um it I forgot schedule my post and I'll forget to go and check back in on them so for me it works better if I can just quit texting you don't don't be like I'm at school put your phones down we have this stupid thing called BYO tea bring it your own technology so the kids walk around with their cell phones and their iPads on texting each other all day Thank genius for thinking about one up mm-hmm anyways um I don't remember where I was going with that uh Jen had a question um blog pages oh she's been stalking them stuck away stock away good ones really good ones to stock Katy Hafner house one I think it's katie Hefner a blogspot um Katie I Hefner as in queue um then Melanie's i think is one of the best out there she's someone who really really goes into their Miguel Carrasco has a great blog if you want to check his out and who else a lot of coaches on Melanie's team so Melinda bez Nia's and Amy Jo to sing Amy economy Joe to Sansa Amy to sands oh um Deidre penrose Kaylee Hennessy Katy Katy does one yeah Katie's is awesome I remember when Katie started coaching about six months before me and I remember her when she was working full-time her her blogs would be like check out this recipe i made for dinner and she put it in it was like the most basic but it got her blogging every day so if you go back and look at her really old posts from like two and a half years ago you'll see that they're junk but the point is she started doing it every day and started being consistent with it once a week or week whatever um do you guys have any questions Alison chief your earbuds in your mouth no it looked like she was like this trying to lick the ear wax off she's like oh yummy potatoes oh sorry I'm in rare form tonight um it's cuz I can't have any of this yeah it's still sitting here from last night instead I have to drink a whole bunch of this yeah yeah God stupid I wish I like two eggs i could eat hard-boiled eggs that'd be good mm-hmm gag Barry oh oh speaking of did you guys try have you guys tried the Shakeology chocolate bar it's genius tablespoon of coconut oil heated up mixed with a teaspoon of espresso or a teaspoon of coffee because it brings out the chocolate flavor um mixed with a capful of vanilla extract I know you love quest bars mixed with an entire packet of vegan chocolate Shakeology it becomes like this paste I put mine in a little sandwich bag and made it into a bar and I put it in the fridge and I got a cold today and it was a protein and a chocolate bar for me today oh I looked forward to it all day I said Oh Kelly if you can just make it through with all this meat all the stupid meet you can have your chocolate and it was I feel like normal human now so i'll probably blog about that meg was in ski made that up and then one of her coaches posted it in this other group so if you guys have any questions any questions about blogging yes i will share in her breasts of course i posted you guys are on Team harmony I'll posted um any questions about Pinterest Michelle did you miss anything with Pinterest are you guys cool with the blogging did you get a lot of information probably too much it can be information overload remember one thing at a time do one thing for a month make it or 21 days whatever make it a habit and then picks up something else it's just like we're telling all the new coaches in the challenge group that we're going to have you be a product of the product this week and next week we expect you to keep doing that and then start inviting so it's going to be you know we're building on each other build on what you're learning so next week I know we don't have a lot of people in this call tonight because people knew it was gonna be like I don't know what the hell she's talking about not getting on it next week we're not gonna do our call because it's the surge so I am probably just going to start a chat in team harmony like a big hey let's talk about search beat right there if you guys want to join in join in if not you don't have to it's totally up to you guys definitely watch it they are planning to talk a lot about Beachbody on land because I'm about 90% sure that it is launching and large 12 11 12 because did you guys you guys know about our commissions on club memberships did you read about that right now we get fifty percent commission and starting on March 11th anyone that signs up from that date forward we will only get forty percent commission on that which is one of the way they're covering their costs on it which I get um and I'm fairly certain within the next six months definitely by the end of the year the cost is going to go up probably too this is just my guess 5999 every three months okay so like 20 bucks a month but we don't have to do that if you keep your club membership you don't have to do that do the survey I think I did the survey Allison did anyone ask you mean the survey about Beachbody on demand I didn't do it because um I haven't been able to login so i wanted to be like you get in I don't answer that i was just curious because it had asked like some of the questions were like how much would you pay for this service and then there was like I can't remember if it was like a multiple like arranged you know what I mean between here to here or whatever and then another one was like how much would you sell this for so I was just curious because I was like look at these options like I wonder what it's going to be you know my guess and this is purely based on chatter with other coaches in the TR diamonds group I've with Ashley and stuff on that it least it's probably going to go up to like 59 99 of course they're not going to put it at sixty dollars even they're going to put it one penny less so it looks a little better you know you're selling your house for 199 thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars that's not 200 yeah that won't get you a whole lot anywhere but um yeah so uh we foresee at least it being about 20 bucks a month I know they are going to have the challenge pack for probably actually that's prob you know what else and you asked me about March promos boom right there I can pretty much guarantee it 140 yeah I can pretty much guarantee I'm because I was trying to think after you asked me that I'm racking my brain thinking one has a bit on sale they're going to do that starting mid month and I bet they will keep it to the end of April that would be my guess and what is it shakeology and then is it 90 days to 90 days so I mean it's it's a pretty good deal and I know I haven't got like I said I haven't been able to log in plus I I stood you've a workout last week is good mover arm pissed me off so any more look at it but I can move it look it hurts like a  but I can move so tomorrow arm day will be on will be interesting but I actually had one of my little fifth graders conducting at school can

what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over

for some review on some concentrates really excited to do some of these because i've been doing a lot of strain chasing and eighty percent of doing these reviews is the strain chasing ten percent might be the review and the other ten percent is the editing which is done amazingly by capoholic i love the love you give me on those edits and keep them coming so today i'm going to be doing some concentrates and i got some new glassware also very excited about like i said this is a strange chase so we're chasing strains we're chasing equipment also terp slurper gotta love the chirp slurper i love this thing it hits like nothing else kind of gives you a different high on the whole expectation of the strains and the taste it's i mean it gives me a different effect than if i use my peli nail which i love also but it's just a different effect it's just a preference of what you feel like that day i got some new glass to play with a little bit of stuff and i've been picking up a lot of flour also so i have a lot of flower reviews coming up a whole lot of flower reviews exclusive strains searching from la back up to the bay out to colorado utah oregon washington we go everywhere we need to go to find these strains so we can bring you a good review and you can kind of see what you're getting before you get it so whether you're gonna be disappointed or not or it just gives you a little bit of an insight of what you're looking for and you can get a little view before you even get it and you get to the club and pay whatever they're charging you for so i'm really excited about this new turk slurper and all the flower strains that are gonna be coming up i'm sorry i've been running around like i said a lot of this is in the hunt for the strains you gotta hunt for the strains so i can bring it to you so you guys can see whether you like it or not or if it's what you're thinking it is in your mind but my mind's different from yours also so it just gives you a little bit of a view of what to look for and what you may or may not like as long as it helps you a little bit i'm happy that's my sole purpose in these reviews so let's get to some dabbing and see what it looks like stacking up the strains a little bit got all the different exotics in here to do reviews on i mean this jar is full there's probably a few probably about three ounces of just eighths of different kinds of exotic strains i'm gonna do some reviews on you guys for and i'm excited about getting to that right now when you get to our concentrates um i was stacking those pretty well but you know i like the smoke so i smoked a lot of them too so what does it look like we're gonna work with today today i actually want to get to this raw garden that looks amazing but that's diamond so it ain't no sauce it ain't going to get messed up like that so we got the usual drop refined live resin diamonds from raw garden gotta love aurora garden folks let's see what we working with tore park package a little bit got a little little over excited ripping it open that uzo drop raw garden refined live diamonds gotta get on that take a little closer look at those pretty girls they're not dry in there too that's what i really like you get these refined live diamonds from raw garden they're usually pretty moist in there with some turp sauce so you get a little bit of taste too i love diamonds for that glimmer [Music] but like i said these diamonds knock you back too but these are full flavor too that's what i like about the refined live diamonds from raw garden had a lot of diamonds and some diamonds they knock you back but they just don't have the flavor of the strain but raw garden does that pretty well look at that that's a nice diamond to dab on on a sunday morning before football that usual drop now let's get this ready for a taste excited about this love the taste of the terp surfer takes a little bit of trial and error getting that right temperature but once you get it you can't beat it i like to maybe overheat it a little bit so it gives me some time to play with it and get all my stuff my concentrates ready so it's pretty warm right now give it a little check thermometer over here like i know they got nicer setups now and i'm over here in the ice age still check it with my thermometer get my boy butters all ready for the show can't miss butters now let's taste this that uzo drop from raw garden wow super tasty wow real sweet taste and definitely strong i'm not even gonna lie the flavor of that surprised me a lot um the uzo drop it's pretty strong it's about 93 total thc with thca it knocks you back pretty good but it's really tasty i'm surprised by that i thought it was going to be a little bit stronger but they substituted that with flavor and taste and i've really been liking taste and terps lately over the strength of something because i want to enjoy what i'm smoking gave me a little bit of cough so got a little bit of pressure too i really like that it's really tasty i'm not really sure what the cross is with the uzo drop but i would definitely get it again it's that tasty i'd have to give it in flavor i'd have to give it a nine and a half out of ten out of strength and potency i would probably give it a eight out of ten it's pretty strong but for refined live diamonds i've actually had stronger from them but like i said they substituted the strength with the flavor and i really appreciate that it's really tasty so definitely you got to get that raw garden find live resin diamonds this is what it looks like sorry for the package to make these things so hard to get open sometimes and it's very clean and it's very tasty i really really really really enjoyed it um i would go and grab it again and i believed i grabbed that yuzo drop in san francisco purple md i believe it was called purple star md good place good prices good selection they had a lot of stuff i was very surprised so thank you please click that

people don't know about this they refer to a step down from a live resin but this is considered a diamond sauce they get this focus back in real quick diamond sauce from Gold Coast today one of the top extracts come on I'm making it there you go so it's it's it's one cannabis cups multiple times this is the kosher cush strand and I'm not sure on the actual percentage on it but let me break it down for you this is the labeling for it let's see there it is clear diamond sauce easy way to break it down is they break down every type trooping they can find they break down a lot of different types of triumphs explain it terpenes the cabinets and everything and they they pull it out to like the purest form you can get and then they let it sit like LED wine pretty much and it crystallizes always making sure that you burp it that's what this is what I've heard I'm not like we hopefully expert on it I'm just ill getting to learn just like everybody else but you can get a view on that baby right there there's some diamond today but snow overall smells just like you just rub your hand up and down a [ __ ] plant jacked it off literally but we break off a diamond in here so that's what I mean it literally and that's hard to get focused on but it literally breaks into diamonds so beautiful stuff let me get it I'll just break that up for you right there it's literally just like a pile in diamonds but I'm definitely not gonna take that because it would [ __ ] kill me I'm gonna break off a nice piece of the sauce something diamond I have tickets to the burner concert to be going to so there you go all right one second grab the rig and we're ready to go keeping it real x-factor right here because we have hit the x-factor right here it's ready to go diamond sauce that kosher Kush and your kosher life keeping a kosher hitting at one sitting at twice here we go [Music] but that stuff is some of the best around all right you breathe do a lot better all right so the review on the flavor on that gives you chills it's not good it is sometimes and smell the flavor it's all the same there's no real difference just a lot of lemon I would not a lot of them and more of just like an OG flavor is what you're gonna get out of that kicks like [ __ ] like a [ __ ] the hike is like a roller coaster it just straight goes up and up and up and you don't know when it's gonna end and when you're gonna drop and usually when you do drop you are asleep for a while but that's my review on the end diamond sauce I'm gonna quote this on 21 but I'm gonna put it as diamond sauce that comes up for anybody else hasn't seen my videos check it out review on dabs but thank you for watching review on dabs it's in diamond sauce review let's get a good focusing on that shade right come on there we go shot a go coast that's what [ __ ] right there get one more picture is amazing I would guess the percentage on that maybe around like I feel like it's definitely in the 90s I'm not gonna shot glass and the right there's no doubt we got the ask but good [ __ ] shout out thanks for watching these like that", "9Lm6y-eVcHo": "hello senior stoner fans this is the real senior stoner back at you welcome to the diamond discussion that's right today we're gonna have a very special discussion under magnification we have with us today our magnifying glass lit magnifying glass apologize for the light what we're going to do today under light is we're going to examine different types of diamonds and talk about them let's get started first we're gonna use and discuss excellence diamonds these are and will all be of the first batch california-based diamond manufacturers the excellence brand these are made in March they have a serial number on them all kinds of information about the backs because in California everything has to be tracked seed to sale let's take a look inside oh my goodness well when you get these under glass under magnification it's a different deal you can really look at the glistening you can almost see the terpenes inside so this is the excellence brand comes packaged in a glass jar the bottom of the box is a very interesting thing because on the bottom of the box you can actually see inside that's pretty cool thing another of my favorite brands is southern cow extracts this is Kiwi pie they call SoCal divers this is another one Kiwi pie that gives you the batch number the date package the THC content all kinds of great information comes packaged in a frosted glass labeled on the bottom with what is in their container and let's look under magnification and talk about it also wow this is a little different this has got a little bit of sauce going on I'm not a big fan of sauce but now that I'm doing real dab break it's okay you'll see inside there that it's spread out over a wider area not just the big rocks that we saw in the orange one okay this is Kiwi pie but SoCal dabbers I can attest to the fact that it's extremely tasty we also have violet black water og banana sorbet I'm sampling these to see which one I'm gonna go deeper on neon lights these are all individual grams and double train-wrecked so these are the two brands excellence and SoCal divers I also contract with a grower I think I've discussed with you all and within that I've ordered the following la cush cake in a custom blend oh my goodness Wow these are in fact true diamonds if you can see them glistening over there so this is the la quick take you know every one of these is gonna taste a little bit different so I'm gonna pick a few to dive with you all once I get this display mr. nice guy THC diamonds you all know the brand or the I should say the strain of weed mr. nice guy what I did was I asked for specific things specific ways and I'll talk about that in a second each selection besides the odor being different the texture is different you'll see in a second these are each two gram containers of these diamonds now we're going to go to larger containers we're going to go to five gram containers and I order a very specific type of diamond the next one's gonna be cold dry diamonds and can any of you guess why I use dry diamonds that's right for the Jimmy joints these are my five gram bottles of dry diamonds and on the inside you'll see that they're already sifted they're dry so they'll crumble very well into a joint and then these are my custom gorilla glue number four diamonds I buy these in chunks you can see the chunks kind of rattling around down there so what we've now explained to everybody is there's a lot of different kinds of diamonds out on the market okay and it really depends the flavor the tert profile that you're looking for what you're going to get they're all different and everybody has their own preference everybody likes a different type of diamond that's true we're gonna do right now is we're gonna try La Push cake la quick kick that's the one that is really shiny if you can see the glistening and we're gonna pack it onto the Rio let's go for it all the way what do you say we'll pack it onto the Rio let's go and get a dab speed and take a nice bit of the dad dust if you will boy it's really fluffy I like these lighter diamonds sometimes that aren't so dense like a stone you know I mean like like a real piece of jewelry no the lighter ones are sometimes easier to deal with but let's see how it performs in the machine light off here we go throw them else down well bubbling very nicely let's give it a roll right there boy that was tasty let's finish that up one thing about diamonds Wow they are strong they are strong now we've gotten really good about q-tipping after every use IQ tip the Banger they have to every hit I'm getting better at it so I hope you enjoyed this discussion on diamonds diamonds are from 79% to 97% the purest form of THC a you can ingest the reason I have these in different ways is I have different flavors I like different textures the dry diamonds to go into Jimmy joints the regular diamonds to go into a dab or a pen or an earache so there really a variety of diamonds out there now the other thing you need to look at with diamonds is the cost you can get them you can get diamonds for $40 diamonds or you can get diamonds for $100 you need to be really careful who you buy them from where they're made and how they're made a lot of knockoff diamonds on the market if you remember a thing called pyrite that was fool's gold and in the Old West fool's gold made many a ghost town so don't let people make really pretty shatter or really glisteny wax tell you it's diamonds a very different profile this has been the real senior stoner talking about dabbing diamonds I have a great day out there everybody and thanks for watching", "iNT1Z200ZK4": "[Music] yo yo i'm drew gilchrist and if you've been watching me for a while you know that i actually really like my wax i know i don't smoke a lot of wax on the channel i don't really talk about wax a lot but if you watch the live streams you know when i do have some wax that i like i absolutely love it and my favorite type of wax is either butter or sauce with like diamonds hopefully so it really excited me when the goods hit me up saying hey man we're gonna make our own line of diamonds and turp sauce so i'm super hyped about that because i've never seen a cbd wax have that before also i think youtube [ __ ] over videos that have cbd in the title or descriptions or tags so that's why the title of this is just legal diamonds and terp source because that's the only way i think i can make this video where it'll actually still push it out to everyone who watches my channel oh yeah just before we get into this video as well i wanted to let you guys know that i'm actually doing a giveaway with the goods on instagram right now well i say right now it'll go up about two hours after i post this video so go on my instagram follow me turn on post notifications so that way you can see this giveaway so i'm giving away a my tv you know the mighty vape like the best dry herb vape in the world so definitely definitely check out my instagram anna let's get on with the video so i've got these two diamonds in turp sauce and i must say they're really different to each other so this is the first one that i actually got this is like totally unbranded they were just like hey man have a look at this one so this is actually forbidden fruits now also if you know me you know that i am not a big fan of forbidden fruits and this one also looks really different you can see it's in the turp sauce and everything but the actual wax itself doesn't really look like you know the diamonds that you know and love and also when i smell it it's so crazy fruity i can imagine somebody who like really likes fruity flavors would absolutely love diving on this but i am not the biggest fan of forbidden fruits so i messaged them and i was like hey look it's all good you know you guys sending me over some diamonds and turn sauce but have you got any other ones so i got them to send me over this one which i'm not actually sure what strain this is but i've smelled it and it is like the gassiest thing in the world let me uh let me pop this open and have a little smell of it so the way i would describe the smell on this is it kind of has that gassy smell like you know when you get a bit of weed that almost smells a bit like diesel a bit like fuel it has that type of gassiness to it but then it smells a bit like an apple almost like the core of an apple if that makes sense oh that smells really nice yeah really that is that is actually the perfect way to describe this it does literally smell like you're taking an apple and mixing it with that gas from bud well i guess we're going to dab some of it up and see how it feels see what we're saying also i must say compared to the other one this looks like normal diamonds in terp sauce like that looks like a normal tea oh my god almost fell out but isn't that crazy isn't that what normal thc diamonds in like normal type sauce looks like it's kind of crazy and also i guess the terp sauce part of the diamonds is gonna be exactly the same as what normal terp source is because turps are legal right i guess terp source at that point does have some of the thc in it and i guess it's probably i don't know is term source extracted in the same way as terpenes like is turp sauce in diamonds just terpenes added onto the diamonds or is terp sauce in diamonds there from part of the extract to make the diamonds that's actually just blowing my mind right now because i'm kind of thinking that most diamonds in terps sauce are just you know they have the turps added back in afterwards but now i'm thinking about it i don't think they are maybe not i'm not really too sure i'd love to know the answer that in the comments down below i never thought about that but i guess we're going to dab some of this up and see what this is like and have a little taste of it and i'm pretty excited for that really sorry for the like charred marks on my banger i don't have any iso left i need to order some as soon as possible all right oh that smells really good it really does smell like apples you know if they if they told me that this was apple fritter i'd be like yeah i'm not fair enough this is about what i'm gonna do i have absolutely no idea if you can see that or not the term sauce doesn't make it sticky so it was actually really hard to put it on that side of my dabber i really should have put it on the other side of my dabber all right cheers people [Music] wow that was crazy nice that tasted absolutely [ __ ] amazing so the last time i did one of these cbd reviews a lot of people quite rightly so said that i didn't tell people what the effects were now the reason i didn't really say what the effects was because obviously cbd doesn't give you that same high as like thc does like i can't sit here and tell you like whoa that diamond's dab got me so blazed right because that wouldn't be the case but with these cbd dabs you do still get the effects from the terpenes and cbd itself is a relaxant so it relaxes your body not not in like the same sort of psychoactive highway but it does make you relax but the terpenes can give you effects from all sorts of places because the difference between strains like in the effects is from terpenes right and we just dabbed on basically 30 terpenes in this and i must say i feel quite good i feel quite uplifted i feel like quite awake especially as soon as it's like first thing in the morning i feel really nice and relaxed from the cbd side of things i feel really good i actually feel like i just dabbed on some sativa or something i feel really [ __ ] good and the taste was banging i think all around that was a really really nice experience i'm really really glad they sent me over that new one and i didn't just have to try the forbidden fruits one also right now on instagram i'm doing a giveaway with the goods actually i think it might go up like two hours after i post this video so if it's not up when i post this make sure to follow me on instagram because we're giving away a mighty vape you know the mighty the best dry herb vape in the world like you know the thing everyone goes on about yeah that mighty so if you want to get that definitely

uh definitely see you guys in a bit peace out and um [Music]", "Z35Wku6cpY8": "sup guys so I got a buddy's live resident this is a sativa pineapple kimochi Correction hybrid my bad it got some of the information on the back some of the terpene profiles used to get the strain to taste the way it does there's zero CBD which sucks but I mean kind of excited cuz still some this is still live resin so just try to shut out it's a bit darker than the last two you I had from buddies so just try it out and the the shed in the backyard another taste you could definitely take some pineapple kind of tastes like the pineapple version of cz also got the battery which is just a easy draw you don't have to press any anybody or anything so pretty pretty dope now the clear tips nice - yeah so overall overall a great package say it again so let's think rapes when is a Cecil cartridge puts in work so hope you guys are smoking tool especially on while this quarantine is in place and this rain makes it even better so yeah once again every pull you you have on this it's pretty smooth I haven't really tried see sell that much I had a palm palm battery that kind of broke like two months into it so that was a fail and so far I have no complaints on see so it burns very evenly it's a small to draw so we got day four of the pineapple kimochi hybrid it still hasn't lost his taste the pool is still pretty small it's not getting stuck yet on the mouthpiece so this buddy's pen battery / cartridge has been pretty great for a hybrid now when I saw the TV 65% I was kind of like I'm not gonna feel it or for whatever reason but I was wrong it's very very strong and the battery lasts forever so tonight obtained recommend Cheers", "NB_3QWgcbfY": "sup guys steer Deb's how's it going they're gonna

"zGUdF_8NN-E": "[Music] i know [Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another wax video you know what i'm saying i picked up some of this humboldt stuff i will play a little video showing you a close-up of this i already did that beforehand as you can see it's already open i already tried it but like i said i do have a video of me opening it which uh we'll be playing right now and uh yeah this is humboldt farms this is running at about so i believe it was running i don't know what it was running at because i delete i ripped off the sticker but it says right here it's i think it was 73 to be honest if i remember correctly live resin rainbow sherbet nah yeah let's just show you it's really dark but i do have a video of me showing you what a color it is outside the container but yes let's take a hit very very diamondy and light sauce consistency you know there's very very much diamonds in here you can see it it's very hard rock like let me see if i can get you one see look at that it's definitely not lacking in diamonds uh the taste is not so much there because with diamonds it's not really about taste it's about potency but i do love it when they do have a little bit sauce on it which this one does seem to have and i like to mention that um this says live resin on it it doesn't say diamonds but most of it i would say is is diamond up so i don't know what else to say but very very good stuff they also had three more strains i like to mention that as i'm doing this video right now there is ufc plane and uh yeah hopefully you've been enjoying this ufc uh i mean you'll probably see this video like two weeks after uh today though but cheers very good like i said there's min uh it's like barely barely taste but you can taste it you you definitely get like a herbiness uh very i wouldn't say fruity but there is a sweetness and also i like to mention that this was 29 out the door at finos and uh definitely not bad you know i've had this before i'd like to mention that like i've never did a video on it but i did have this before because i remember this it might have been off of my homies or i did have one myself but i did try this brand before very very good stuff for the price about the same price as raw garden at finos so um but yes i'm gonna pack uh two more hits one here i'm gonna blow towards the camera again and then another hit let me just show you how much we're actually getting but yeah just a quick little wax video uh you know what i'm saying i've been getting a lot of wax lately that has been you know missing you know so it's good when i when i get some of these and they're actually really good you know and stevie said he's tried these before and said it was all right like he said too there's like barely any taste but it's not bad for me cheers maybe you just gotta get the batch or the one without too many diamonds and more of the sauce the live resin sauce i don't know but cheers oh all right one more hit for the video i'm probably gonna end it here hopefully you've been enjoying the content so far you know um let me just get another see look at this diamonds so we're gonna get this last hit on them peace out guys [Music] you", "pq0yWotU1Gk": "hi guys Casey Madden here and join with me today is the jewelry expert and the CEO of levy on Eddie levy on welcome Thank You Casey for having me back at the show of course it's always such a pleasure having you so the royal wedding is coming up and there's no better person to talk to about this then you Le'Veon has a long history with royalty tell me a little bit about this well our ancestors were chosen to guard the royal jewels back in 1746 some of the pieces that we were guarding ended up in the British crown jewels and the Tower of London so we're very excited about the royal weddings coming up this season so it's levy on doing anything special for the royal wedding yes Le'Veon is launching the royalty collection and the royalty collection is composed of the royal colors the royal rings the royal engagement rings and the royal cuts I love them all but let's start off with the colors tell me about the royal colors well the royal colors are the Royal Blues and the Royal Flush so the deep blues and the purples are the colours of royalty and this piece right here is so reminiscent of Princess Diana she loved the deep blue pieces can you tell me a little bit about the story behind this historical piece well these are actually tanzanite museum-quality tanzanite that my late father collected in the 1980s and that you don't find any more of this quality and they're especially unique because of the way they were cut in cabochon shape and so this is a piece that took 30 years before we designed and built it into this one-of-a-kind piece and it has a lot of ties to royalty so tell me now about the royal rings well the royal rings I'd love you on this designing are really inspired by the tiaras at Royal T so we have actually both the tiara collection as well as a demi halo collection and the demi halos are multiple stacks of connected bands that have chevron shape that have a symbolic tiara like of gorgeous and not only do you guys have rail rings who also have royal engagement ring so tell me a little bit about those well the royal engagement rings are really inspired by the royal wedding of Megan Marco and Princess Eugenia and so with Megan Marco she's getting married with the three stone ring with the cushion cut Center and the side stones and so the three stone rings are you know done in a variety of ways inspired by her engagement ring and then Princess Eugenia is getting married with a modified lady die which is a combination of a three stone with halos of

States and it was used for 20 years by the Fiesta Bowl reigning queen each year and it retired and is now part of the levy on through the centuries Museum case and I'm very excited to be sharing this

just do me that favor click off this video but for those who are 18 and up this is an educational purpose channel only about cannabis and for cannabis patients so without further ado let's get big high go get some snacks and let's just vibe out together see i don't even know if y'all can see me but uh welcome back guys we're here at uh main stage this is like their side building at uh what's it called broadway i've noticed that i've been cussing a lot recently in my videos and like that's like a like i got a potty mouth you know what i'm saying so i'm gonna try to cut it down because like genuinely i had another channel it's called chaos realms k-a-o-s-r-e-l-m-g i'll just write it up here and uh what's it called i cuss a lot bro but like what's it called i'll be dropping f-bombs like left to right but we're gonna pull up to main stage we're already here no intro you feel me just welcome back to another video back again but uh we're gonna go ahead and cop that ursa cart so i'll be right back so we just made it back to um or we just made it back from main stage you feel me i did a little bit of homework and then i had to go to like the [ __ ] junkyard or whatever to throw away some [ __ ] so now we're back now we got we're here from uh main stage remember when i said it was on broadway from sacramento well it is it's a neighborhood dispensary all that goodness all that good stuff you know so let's go ahead and see what we got because it's not just any normal car i think it's like i'm assuming it's a um it's a uh ceramic cart because it was like white or some [ __ ] but uh i don't know if it says right here but anyways here it is we got the [ __ ] ursa cartridge now this is one of the cartridges that i'm [ __ ] hyped as [ __ ] to try out because like i've been seeing a whole bunch of reviews on it and with the with the aircraft being so flavorful and apparently the ursas are pretty [ __ ] flavorful too i think about it man like this one's the uh cherry diesel and it's rating at a 72.9 percent thc with zero cbd the package date was uh what's it called september 8th uh best buy september 8th 2021 so they usually have a year life um shelf life they usually have a year shelf life there you go and liquid diamond size card so this is the first time i'm ever gonna try one of these and the first time i'm ever gonna try something with diamonds in it basically but here's the receipt if you go in on monday through wednesday uh from 10 am to one you get like a 10 off so i pulled up it was 50 but then with taxes and everything came out to 53 so shout out to main stage man it came out of 53 and went from 50 to 53 that's basically three bucks tax right there pretty much basically oh holy [ __ ] oh i thought i was gonna say some diamonds no cap damn i didn't even get to see there's no diamonds in here on the box it says uh less than a two volt battery recommended but i guarantee you we're gonna break that rule today all right before we plug it in we have to taste it and i already tasted it i'm not gonna lie let me just tell you something right now the airflow on this like i said on the air graft it's impeccable like that all right so there all right let me compare these two products just real quick so this one's a liquid diamond this is just a live resin right and thing about this [ __ ] is that it it's like you have to draw pretty hard to actually like get the smoke to come out but with this i don't know if you can hear it but just the airflow is crazy you know so uh let's go ahead and put this up on the battery uh let's see where is it at and oh yeah by the dry head too to be honest with you i'm not even getting that much there's like a i don't know if it's because it's not heated up yet but there's like a little subtle taste i can't describe it almost like a like a pastry of some sort like a sweet kind of thingy and like a chocolatey thing i don't know why but it feels like there's like chocolate in it i don't know how to describe it so let's go ahead and hook this up on the ooze and click that double setting so we just connected it up on the ooze and let's go ahead and turn it on i didn't even realize it didn't even turn it on but uh let's go ahead double click it get it heated up and while it's heating up let me compare this [ __ ] with the aircraft right quick so this is a full gram let me stop it right now but this is a full gram whereas this is a half gram and i filmed this video on saturday which was the sixth i believe no no today's the seventh sixth five fourth it was like the third when i did the review and it still tastes good but i don't know if you can see but literally this [ __ ] is gone like it's gone like there's like a pube left at the bottom well i mean it's still like a little puddle but like come on air graph you got to make something that lasts longer at least make full gram carts or do like a two half gram for like 75 i guess i don't know like do like a little combo or something but that that didn't disappoint me on the flavor i'm not gonna lie let's go ahead take a hit [Music] for some reason it's not a it's not hitting through the battery all right so i'm just gonna let it like preheat on the setting so uh let's just let it [ __ ] be because i think i don't know if it's like the thing is too cold if it's like too too live resin if that's even like a [ __ ] justifiable answer but uh hopefully hopefully that that worked hopefully that little preheating worked dude hold on i think i got scammed bro hold on do i need to screw it in like all the way to the max yeah so the problem was i didn't have it screwed in all the way but um it's because so the last battery you had is screwed it in too tight and like there's like a little plate at the bottom of like these like uh 510 threads and um like usually it's like uh if you press down on it too hard it'll like stop the battery from working and that's what happened to my previous battery but it was just the whole entire battery that stopped working not just a little plate but uh that's fun fact that's what happens if you screw in your cart to uh what's it called too tight you'll [ __ ] up your battery i couldn't really get that much flavor off the first hit tasted pretty uh phenomenal though but couldn't really get much um much recognition if that makes sense [Music] no cap when i do like that ghost inhale through my nose it has like a [ __ ] like a foul ass like like a gassy i guess like a literally like it says diesel like literally like it smells like some [ __ ] type of like a some [ __ ] that you shouldn't even sniff bro like smells pretty strong you know the name diesel in this [ __ ] i don't know if it's because it's like a type i don't know if it's because it's a 3.3 and it's supposed to be under a tubal that i'm not getting that much taste but i'm getting a lot of um smell from it if that makes sense like it goes in through my nose i'm not really tasting nothing let me go ahead get some water real quick i don't know how to describe it like i'm not getting that much of a uh sweet taste like i know on weed maps i think it said something about [ __ ] sweet but i do get like kind of like a funk on it you know what i'm saying like when you it's not necessarily like a taste like the taste i'm not really tasting nothing really but i'm smelling it like i can taste it with my nose basically you know what i'm saying like sniff it and then it coats my mouth but it's mainly just like a stink you know what i'm saying like a guess like a diesel i've never had any diesel strains not really getting that much flavor dead ass i don't know if it's because [Music] like literally it does not taste like anything but like besides like that gassy funkness you know what i'm saying like you don't get nothing from like uh like nothing really you really don't besides like what i said like it smells kind of like like funky you don't really get no uh like a sweet flavor like how this one managed to do like the aircraft you could [ __ ] taste everything with that [ __ ] bro but i i what i really want to say that it's because of the battery so i'm gonna have to redo this whole video will not redo but [ __ ] segment it either to another day or i might just upload this video as it is in conclusion man this cartridge i don't want to say was a waste because obviously the 3.3 and it literally tells you on the packaging use a less than a 2 volt battery so i really don't want to say it's the the card itself because [Music] off them dry hits you get some i guess some like aromatic um what's it called like a bliss of [ __ ] like uh just like a bliss of like a i did get a [ __ ] sweet bliss of like [ __ ] i don't want to say like cherries but maybe well actually probably like cherries like you do you actually on the dry heads to be exact you do get like a sweet maybe like a cherry like i'm not really feeling the cherry like i can feel something sweet it does kind of feel like fruity but it feels more like a flowery type of not like a wheat flour but like a like you just smell some sweet flowers you know what i'm saying like that's what it feels like it tastes not not no cherry i could kind of see the cherry now but it's more like that flowery sweet maybe with a little bit of cherry that's all i have to say maybe but to me personally it's like kind of sweet and then i guess you get that diesel vibe which is what i was talking about kind of like when i was saying chocolaty i guess kind of chocolatey like earthy you know what i'm saying so guys i started to connect the dots right i was like it's more like a baked good but it's also kind of chocolatey so it's like like a earthy taste if i'm saying like this [ __ ] got me faded like i'm tweaked but yeah like i guess i got earthy and um definitely when you smell it a gassy ass [ __ ] taste or gassy smell but really the flavor profile is mainly based off of these dry heads and it's very subtle let me let me try something real quick yo can you see like past my head let me see kind of i guess that was like a weird way of measuring it but like i hope that's like steady you know what i'm saying but like i said after really the only flavor profiling is from the dry hit now i brought the water for a special occasion and that is when you taste bud to me personally i feel like i don't know if it's just like an effect in my head maybe like some randomized [ __ ] like thought that came across my mind but i feel like if you are to hit this right like it usually happens to me with flour i've noticed this a lot is i take a hit i got the bong to be exact and then i drink some water and you get i guess it activates like a bigger flavor profile this is like a theory but this is like i personally feel like it's the way it should work right so you ever had candy like a jolly rancher and just hit like you're finished with it and then you're just chilling and then you drink water and then you taste that jolly rancher taste like it's subtle taste but it's there that's what water i think does with the terpene so we're gonna go ahead and see if this is like genuinely how it works like this feels like it should work because this usually happens to me when i be smoking flour when i was smoking on when i was smoking on the antibiotics the blueberry i didn't really taste it at first well through the joints i did but on the long ribs not really so what i did was i drink water and i'd get like a sweet like node kind of so let's go ahead just let's take a swig and let's take a hit [Music] let's take another swig actually another hit [Music] all right so i don't know if it's just because it's a flower that i did get the taste or if it's because of the cartridge but i didn't really get [ __ ] from that either so let's go ahead and so from this in conclusion all right this [ __ ] battery is like eyes all right this is all i gotta say so if i'm going to do this review on this ursa card i got to get like a two-volt battery because like i'm getting some taste at the 3.3 but it's like like literally on the past hits you know the one where it [ __ ] came out my nose in the second hit i couldn't really taste like i could taste like that subtleness this [ __ ] is hidden and um i do get that like taste you know what i'm saying like that uh what i was talking about earlier earlier i [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] tweaking but what i was talking about earlier it was kind of like blossomy kind of now i get someone like cherry but i'ma still stick like i can see the cherriness because i can taste it but i can also taste that blossomy like sweetness like a flowery blossomy sweet so i'm just gonna say like here's the cherry here's a blossomi we're just gonna [ __ ] bam in the [ __ ] middle you feel me so it's gonna be just in the middle dead shot so once if you ever try this cart that's what it tastes like it tastes like in between a cherry and like a blossoming thingy and like i said like an earthy gassy like diesely [ __ ] like smell like burn kind of but literally dead ass the reasoning as to why i didn't really get much flavors mainly because of the battery and because i really want to put this video out of me trying a ursa cart i'm not going to say that this [ __ ] is ass but i am going to say that this [ __ ] is [ __ ] amazing you could taste the flavor like an insane amount of flavor on this [ __ ] man whereas on this you really can't to me personally i don't know if there's something out of my palate today but i'm gonna genuinely blame the battery now this isn't oozes fall for not because like it's a 3.3 battery this isn't oozes fall this is like a default like thingy and you can change the voltage it's mainly because this is more of like a [ __ ] like a low temp car or low temp battery and if i was able to put this in here then i genuinely would and i would get a better [ __ ] flavor profile but we're gonna have to uh do another video except with a different battery shoot all right so i know i said in the last segment that i was gonna [ __ ] um just i was gonna [ __ ] get a new battery get something that will like fit the [ __ ] cartridge but i realized that if you [ __ ] double click it it actually heats the car at a lower temperature than it has i'm assuming that it heats it at a 2.0 volt which is like i guess the minimal amount that you can taste the taste but like if you want the maximum flavor profile you got to get that 1.8 battery and i was gonna i was going to cop the [ __ ] ursa battery but that [ __ ] was just like too expensive bro like if [ __ ] main stage had that [ __ ] i would have copied but they don't i'd have to go to another [ __ ] place and they charge you [ __ ] 30 bucks for that battery that i'm only gonna use on ursa carts maybe even buddies cards but i don't really know of any places that dispense buddies so uh and i heard that they're good so we're gonna have to [ __ ] soon try that [ __ ] so let's go ahead and connect this [ __ ] up and i'll hit y'all guys in a [ __ ] bit you know all right so here it is you already know it's already [ __ ] connected and right out the packaging i started to notice that it does smell like weed more i cheat this thing a couple of times but like when i first unboxed it you didn't really smell nothing you really just smell like basically what it tastes like damn near except you don't get that sweet like cherry blossomy [ __ ] thingy that i was talking about let's go ahead double click it you already know and i'm just i gotta wait all right yeah so like that flavor profile gotta do it again so honestly man right off the bat i gotta [ __ ] move the smoke everywhere but anyways right off the bat man like like i said you all right so if you do do it at the two volt right off the bat you do somewhat taste that cherry blossom but that like that like gassiness that you smell almost like which you smell the car you taste it more than that little [ __ ] background taste but on a dry head you get that sweet taste so if i do have something underneath the 2 volt battery man i would have [ __ ] reviewed it right on the [ __ ] spot you know what i'm saying but instead i just double clicked it you know got that two two volt i think at least here so i i think that that's what it is because they look at other batteries and they say that they're like two volt on the preheat so um i mean [Music] would i recommend this [ __ ] and like i said in the like the little last segment i don't even know if i'm gonna even put that in because i couldn't even get my word straight but uh i would definitely recommend it for you guys because uh they're just like they're expensive kind of but they're just actually worth the price like 50 bucks for a cart that's what you would pay for like a [ __ ] one gram plug play card and that's like not it you know this that's distillate this is [ __ ] basically as closest to the [ __ ] plan you can get as possible so yeah uh i'm gonna go ahead and preheat it again and we're gonna take another hit so we're just gonna see if we can get more of that flavor back in there i feel like the less vapor you get i feel like the more you taste possibly literally no cap like how i said last time or just like a few seconds ago i guess it's like literally the same thing you know it just has that gassy diesely diesel you know what i'm saying i haven't tried the diesel uh strain at all but it has like a [ __ ] like a cherry blossom sweetness in the back like a gassy taste to it but would i recommend this thing like i said absolutely man this thing is definitely worth it so if you guys have it at your disposal maybe try to get something that's like more of a sativa on the side because i know that sativas are more fruity whereas indicators are more like earthy and like all that fun stuff you notice all that gassiness but this is like right in between like the dry hits you get that sweet but [Music] still get what like the car smells like so uh yeah that's pretty much like the end of this video bro like i hope you guys did enjoy this and uh if you guys are out here in sac make sure to go ahead and visit main stage man like snag up and take advantage of those uh monday through wednesday deals you gotta be there from 10 to one something like that or 11 to 1 and you get like ten percent off so basically if you do the math with taxes and everything it's like um it's legit get the retail price add three bucks on it so like this car was 50 i only paid 53. hope you guys did enjoy this video once again and i do got a really [ __ ] nice banger i'm gonna take my time on this video so if i don't upload for a week not not this one but the video that i'm gonna record today um yeah if it doesn't [ __ ] like if you don't if i don't upload in like a week or so that's because i'm busy with school and work but hopefully if my plans come together i'll give it to you guys by uh next week

nice chill smoke session basically we take the nice fat bong in and we're gonna be taking a dab of a diamond we got my last diamond here of some 398 ghost one stand up show that to you guys I figured what better way to take the last dab or to dab my last diamond than be to record a YouTube video for it I would post to my Instagram but suppose you guys who don't know I did have an Instagram account he had thirteen point three thousand followers it got deleted and then I managed to get it back the next day so it's kind of making me kind of cautious to post to it I don't want it to get deleted again for no reason so I'm trying to kind of lay low on Instagram and I want to start posting more to the YouTube channel so let's just go ahead and start breaking up a bowl and we're gonna want to take a bat ball here real quick and then of course we're gonna go ahead and get into the dab I got the rebels glass ring here I felt like I should start recording more of my setup but here are the pendants by the way rebels glass the one on the left the pipe pendant is actually fully functional I could smoke out of this pipe if I wanted to I don't think both of them are rebels glass though just this one on the right here oh yeah guys you guys already know it so when it comes down to the content in general that I'm trying to make it doesn't even matter if it's not cannabis related I don't have to be smoking in the video for me to post it just know that you so if you guys do want to see me play different video games you know scary games whatever you guys want to see just throw it down in the comments I keep on trying to bounce off of what you guys are suggesting me so that way I can uh overall just have more content to post for you because I do want to post content that I enjoy to create as well and that's why I'm trying so hard to make gaming content cuz I love gaming content it's like my favorite kind of videos to make it's just I finally got a PC how to edit and I'm just getting better at it so we got some good games coming out this year as well we got modern warfare we got Gears of War 5 I cannot wait for both of those games and hopefully we get some new horror games coming out here soon because escape that I you Loki which is the game you guys see me get jumpscared by it's a michael jackson horror game hopefully the developers of that game can make another horror game here soon because they did a really good job at the last game that did so shout out to deadly crow games i did say in the beginning of this video that we are going to dab on this diamond so right after the ball okay we're gonna go ahead and take that dap and i might come up close to you guys so you guys can see what it looks like but cheers let's go and [ __ ] rip this down rockin the new

got to see how hard I try to pull this bowl if this bowl was a conventional style bowl I would have snapped it but I tried to avoid snapping it so that way I can keep my glass cleaner got a built-in glass screen those are actually like some of the best bowls out there if you guys ask me because it allows you to burn all of your weed evenly without wasting any of it plus it keeps your bong way cleaner of course we got the dabit Aladin sword gavvers Gavilan swords always my favorite so what I'm gonna do I'm probably gonna heat up the dab like right here and then I kind of want to walk around in front of the camera and take a DAB up close so you guys can see it milk up beautiful diamond so let's go ahead and get this [ __ ] and thank you guys for [ __ ] watching the videos keep in mind guys I'm not just a cannabis Channel that's just where I started so this is just like the content you guys are used to saying there's plenty more kind of play more styles of content that you guys are going to see from me in the future so we're gonna take the dab like this got the dab right there alright everybody Cheers telling you guys when you hit those dabs and you pack them deep into your lungs little shits hit you right behind the eyes anyways guys I appreciate you for [ __ ] watching this video that's most likely gonna be it I just wanted to kind of take this last dab this last diamond that I had and kind of show it off to somebody however like I said I've been kind of nervous to post on Instagram saying is they deleted my account and then gave it back like a literally the next day so and plus Luke losing 13 thousand followers is kind of it's [ __ ] up so you know I don't want to lose that again so thank you guys for [ __ ] stick with me thank you guys for watching this

and diamonds in Arkansas so it's interesting that you can't find as much gold in Arkansas as you can the interest in diamonds and I'll talk about a little bit about how those diamonds came to be and what you're looking for when you're looking for diamonds it's kind of interesting also that you can use this USGS mapping thing I've been talking about that's that link down below sourdough miner comm slash ggm government gold maps and so pretty much this tool allows you to see how you can find different things and one of the things we're going to do today is adventure a little bit off the beaten path and look for something other than gold that's valuable like diamonds so it's it's useful because you can also look for gems you can look for emeralds you can look for things like that and based on those items you can find other things that might be of interest to you while you're panning and prospecting because they tend to come out in the wash so to speak they may show up in your pan and you need to know what you're looking for and if they do you need to know what's upstream and what you might be prospecting for that isn't gold so it might be very valuable now Emal's for example can be extremely valuable if you find a good source so let's take a look I have colored Arkansas right now I'm gonna check to see let's pause for a second I'm gonna chickens make sure everybody's on line with this and that we're getting good audio per usual double check the stream and make sure we're live which we are make sure we have audio we have audio okay so we're good hey Charles good evening let's see we got Bob and Charles sound no and pictures very good the sound is going now at least I thought I heard it I don't know why it wasn't there earlier so maybe I need to recap for a moment make sure we have sound loud and clear they say okay so let's recap I'll rewind from the start so tonight we're going to go and look at gold and diamonds in Arkansas and specifically what I wanted to show you a little bit about was how you can use this thing I've been talking about all along this link down below the government gold maps tool ggm sourdough miner thing you can go check that out later it's cheap and it's easy to get to if you're interested that's fine if you're not that's fine too so the purpose of this exercise is to use that tool that set of tools in a particular way to find some points of interest throughout Arkansas I have noted the gold in yellow per usual but one of the things that that might be interesting is just to kind of step back and look at the nature of Arkansas and what's going on here because there isn't a lot of gold and that fits with what we noticed before as we head across away from the East Coast through into Arkansas let me back off on this thing a little bit so remember we had all kinds of gold here over in Alabama still showing up because I left to turn on but then it kind of petered out as it went toward Mississippi and we didn't find a whole lot of golden in Missouri we did find some though down in this lower quadrant you know the bottom and so look up to the Missouri and the Alabama videos you can find them somewhere around here on Facebook or over on YouTube on my prospector jess channel and then what you're going to want to do is just kind of pay attention to the fact that that there was a fair amount of gold found over in this area and copper and stuff like that that we were doing I'm doing the same trick I've been doing the last few months actually weeks the beginning of the month didn't need to because there was lots of gold find and so it gave you kind of a good lead that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be good to look at it copper and in this case green is zinc because these are all associated metals that go with gold so I'm painting copper and zinc on Eric is given in in a red reddish reddish orange so the area of copper and manganese here in this North Mountain mind now it's important to pay attention because zinc also goes like copper does with gold and notice this one is an unknown and it gives copper as the main and then iron phosphorus phosphates tantalum hmm interesting stuff that's valuable zinc okay so here we go we've got a whole bunch a whole band of very interesting rare --is-- metallic minerals up here on these various properties in the corner of Arkansas up toward Missouri now if you recall we found some gold over in this area so right here I notice there's this Baker mine it's copper what I'm saying here is this would infer that there may still be some residue or gold residue in this region of Arkansas even though there aren't mines marked out here and again we have this this regional anomaly this mountain range and then it's kind of cut back we have all this stuff from the the from the Mississippi River which cuts right down along this border that's why it's so kinked up right here and so this tends to be alluvial stuff and therefore is going to be loaded with really fine gold and not much in the way of coarse stuff the people who are finding gold in this part of Missouri are finding mostly very fine gold and some some flake no Nuggets okay for the for the most part that's gonna probably be true of most of these things now this old Spanish Diggins I thought was kind of interesting this is down to Central Arkansas it lists gold as a commodity and it says surface and it lists underground so that that was kind of interesting in its own right because when you find surface in underground tends to mean that they've somehow found a placer deposit that leads to a lode mine there's no further indication no dates or anything like that some of these are very old like old Spanish diggings kind of implies and so you're kind of flying on your own when you're in his regions but that's that's one area another one is this auto mine here which has zinc as we can see in the green and over here we have gold so antimony lead zinc silver and gold I didn't look up I didn't put silver on the map because I thought I was gonna get polluted James tonight Fela right and Steuben eight so these are all you know very interesting ores of antimony lead silver and and eventually it's got some gold here so this is good stuff let's see if it has any information about dates 1962 intimate in the u.s. Stuber night deposits of seven or County Arkansas so there you go sixty-two records and we have gold and antimony in this area so right next to it is this Busby prospect which is known for lead and zinc here we've got mercury arsenic antimony silver and zinc again and when you start seeing arsenic and silver and zinc and Mercury they can go with gold as well so now all of these guys tend to be something that might be a little bit you know on the hazardous side to deal with but it's there let's see up in this region up here we have a bunch of cleans whole bunch of claims lead and zinc so there's a lot of lead up in here and a lot of lead over in here it's kind of interesting how these clusters exist now so that's one aspect of what I wanted to go into tonight and I think that's kind of it for the metallic prospects let's take a look at something else you can find using this government gold map technique and that is you can find even diamonds for example right in here is a whole bunch of kimberlite mines as you can see and these all relate to the Crater of Diamonds area which is right here and of course their commodity number one is diamonds and when you zoom in which is kind of cool you'll see what I mean now you would be expecting because remember diamonds come from old volcano you may see a volcano around in here I don't but that doesn't mean that there isn't a kimberlite pipe or no volcanic pipe that's been eroded off flat and the material within the pipe that was captured which are these kimberlite resources that break down and release the diamonds which are crystals stuck in the middle of that kimberlite which was embedded really deep in the surface of the earth and then has been eroded ever since so what we're looking at here is a whole series of locations including this one's kind of off pat off the path it's Ozark mine but these are all diamond mines of various sorts and I notice you know lately somebody had picked off here in the last month or two a couple of one to two carat diamonds out of this area it's a pretty good find what they do is kind of interesting notice how it's all tilled they come in here and they they basically till the soil every so often and then they have to rainfall wash the surface and what happens is when the surface is washed after you till it any diamonds that are released will become highly reflective and so they stand out like a road marker and you can literally pick them off the ground you can also take the material off the ground that you find and sift it through with a sieve and and essentially do the same thing you do when you when you've mined for gold you can do a processing with your pan and find the stuff and release it that way so there's a whole series of tools that you can use there are some special ones that have special kinds of SIVs that you use for releasing diamonds and if you're in a region has diamonds or jewels or gems you might want to invest in a set of those tools just because they're useful for uncovering this kind of material again you know diamonds Crater of Diamonds south it's a very popular park a lot of people come here and dig up diamonds and it's been fun to see recently that people are getting bigger and bigger and better and better Jin's they're known for yellow diamonds which are not your brilliant whites but it turns out in the world of diamonds yellows and browns and things like that are becoming kind of popular because they're kind of an oddity or unique in your own character which is cool I always like things that are unique anyway probably because it's the way nature is and when you get things that are just you know brilliant white it's kind of yeah that's that's okay but it's cool to see colors and things like that that are their natural artifacts due to the composition of the material here's another one another diamonds own so somebody's planning to go to diamond hunting there and and that's great primarily just like gold you know you're in this to discover what's there what's possible and you know not to get rich necessarily but at the same time there's no reason you can't avail yourself of the concepts involved here and look at other locations with similar properties and I'll bring up that in a second here so this is all about diamonds in this one zone I called it kind of purply to differentiate it from a different color I gave which kind of a purple red which I run out of colors after a while they all start looking alike remember this one's copper is kind of a brassy red but you can't quite see it that way this one's kind of a maroon for the lack of a better color and it's a wave light mind and it's categorized as gemstone okay so one other thing you might want to do with these maps is Mark out local sources for gemstones that's not necessarily diamonds not necessarily an emerald it could be things like agates or any semi-precious or precious gemstones could include corundum which would be rubies and things like that but it's important to kind of map these out and know what you're dealing with and and kind of be able to find those things if you see him in the creek when you're prospecting for gold it's fun to be able to isolate those things now this one is geologists Hot Springs gives a phone number 1960 1965 is the year discovered so these are all kind of relatively recent and when I see something that says 1960 70s even 40s my brain goes into gear because it says that means it could be more in the area eighteen hundred's still could be more but you know it might be picked over depending upon if there were a lot found in the area but as in gold it can also be you know like what you saw with the diamonds all it takes is a little tilling from the soil or some floods coming through and changes the whole ballgame in terms of your ability to find stuff so just be aware of that see this one's copper Big Bear mining company here we go here here's one I thought was interesting these are unknown gravel pits and unknown pits gemstones surface mine let's see what it has to say USGS gemstone doesn't tell me what what kind of gems were finding that I don't have a clue and it says unknown or UNK uncle uncle gemstone here let's see what this one says probably the same thing yep same same basic description so again you'd have to dig deeper into other material to find the type of stones you might expect in this region but it does indicate that there are some sources here's one over by Tex Arcana highway map I'm not sure what that means again we're gonna draw a skunk I don't know what those things are but they apparently are some sort of mineral that's considered to be a gemstone in the USGS it would be worth your while to look at the geology of the region and map that out and understand what kinds of gemstones might come there like that wave of light might be a particular gemstone that you're looking at I'm sure it is and then you might go along with that the Crater of Diamonds is interesting it's also interesting is you know are there other kimberlite or kimberlite structures in the area Murfreesboro Murfreesboro I am not good at these words so so anyway it would be worth your while just to kind of explore that thought but that's part of what I wanted to bring up tonight there isn't so much in the way of gold but there is an awful lot of opportunity for all kinds of interesting stuff again if you go along the Mississippi here where things get kind of broad and wiggly and there's a huge floodplain you can see by this lightened area here that's worthy of investigation but would also tend to indicate to me that you know we have a lot of flood gold here not much else and so that's what I would be expecting to see along this area from Memphis you know basically all the way down the Mississippi and so we've talked about that in the Missouri video and the same thing holds true here and so that's kind of it let's see if you got any questions for me real quick good and then we'll call it a night ready to go back nice camping arrays - so Bill's been there Tyson says there's diamond mines about 45 minutes way out of Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown so I think we're done for tonight that's it for now this is Arkansas and we're looking at what gold and diamonds look like in the region kind of give you an idea the zinc and all that kind of stuff and how it relates and how you think about the map and how we're looking for different metals and minerals and how that goes together with your hunting and prospecting for gold this is prospector jess over now don't forget the ggm thing I mentioned it earlier that's how I do these maps and put them together I'm gonna be kind of hit and miss this weekend so you know stay tuned but I may not be on so just be aware of that so if you if you see me you'll see me if you don't you won't because I don't know what my Wi-Fi or my connections up where I'm going or gonna be like I'm trying to see if I can't do a little field trip in the middle of this thing but it might be a little awkward so we'll see what happens we'll catch you then good prospecting and good night", "N4RvOZgB5MQ": "i like didn't spare any expense for my party i got the best presents the best cake and the best food there's pizza ice cream soda burgers donuts even a pinata oh sounds great i'm

grubby fingers and click that [ __ ] down below today i got a cart review it's coming to you by ursa i don't know if any of you guys have heard of her so before i've tried their extracts i've never tried their cartridges this is a liquid diamond sauce cart the stray is golden strawberry and it is a 78% THC and 0 on the CBD the containers are kind of neat there's a little button here on the side you got a push and then you pull the top off and then it's in the sea and then it's inside and pull it out it's got the covers on the top and bottom the covered stayed in there but it is there and the cover on the bottom pull that [ __ ] off it does got a little head room in there which isn't too bad got the California sticker as you can see and the ceramic top or porcelain whatever in porcelain ceramic sure I do got my fully charged battery here so let me get a dry hit sheet it tastes like kind of strawberryish yeah a little bit of you get a hint of strawberry it did come with this little card inside that reads due to supply interruptions caused by kovat 19 we will be using C cell cards to fill supply gaps we will be back to our all ceramic cards as soon as possible so I guess they use all ceramic carts most the time but right now due to Co vid they're using the C cell which most companies do use the C cell but there's nothing wrong with it alright I hope you guys are stand baked out there having a great morning great afternoon night whatever time it is you're watching this let's get it in liquid diamond okay right up to get it was extremely smooth as in when I was hitting it I couldn't even tell I was hitting anything until I bleep I didn't even know I was getting anything till I blew the smoke out that's how smooth it was highness it's you do feel it diamond sauce card these are pretty pricey I can't lie to you guys for the gram it ran me almost 60 bucks about 60 bucks for this gram so if you can't afford it don't worry about it that's why I'm reviewing it for you guys then you know if it's worth this [ __ ] or not see if you turn it upside down to see how thick it is oh yeah that shit's bomb do the bubble test take forever for that bubble to start going up really smooth it doesn't it's not a fruity flavor though for a be calling golden strawberry it's not like all fruity or strawberry tasting I actually like it cuz I don't like the fruity carts the reason I got this one is because it was the highest THC when they had it so I'm spending 60 bucks for the gram they get the one with the most THC they got ain't [ __ ] around that little baby [ __ ] [Music] it's a lot like a raw gardens cart to me I don't know what the difference is you know between live dot or liquid diamond sauce cart it says distillate free additive free contains a hundred percent cannabis oil so yeah I like the packaging I like that little I like the packaging a lot I think that's pretty neat you like it I gotta say I thought I was gonna get me a lot more baked off the first couple hits than it has so far but like smoothness and flavor is good behind us is good too but for the 60 bucks I was hoping it was gonna kick me in the dick a little harder than what I'm feeling right now I don't know it could be one of those creepers maybe it takes a minute and then it then it hits me does the longer I'm sitting of course I'm getting more stone but I'm taking more hits I'm gonna do a whoo - ooh for you guys not too crazy I'm gonna go to Capitola beach tomorrow if any of you guys know where that's at I'm gonna get out of town for the day go over to the beach eat something good I want to go to Santa Cruz but Santa Cruz is shut down right now do Chuco vid so you got a gotta do it you can good you can stop this bomb impact for the gluten shoot MA and those of you that don't know it who do shoot it's where you take a long look and slam the beer before you blow out the smoke shot up challenge accepted he's the king of the Hooton shoot ball king of a hoot and shoot everybody check out his channel challenge accepted he's on the easy youtuber he does that awesome beer review and beer drinking challenges so scope him out a nice [ __ ] fat bowl packed all the way to the brim okay let's see let's get one more hit of this in the hoot and shoot well I'm gonna end with the hooting shoots up here one more hit and give you guys a review [Music] [Music] all right I've took enough hits already to where I can get you a give you my honest review on it I wanted to Big Ups it because I spend a lot of money on it and you know it's fancy it's this stole diamond sauce cart so I thought it was gonna [ __ ] be like the best car I ever had but to be honest with you guys I like the raw garden ones and the la cloche ones better than this one so far maybe the diamond or the liquid diamond sauce is isn't that great for me I don't like it maybe maybe I like the the live resin or distillate it seems like gets me more babies as a smoothness and flavor it's awesome a fear like a beginner or you know I don't wanna be raped like sexist but like a girl that only likes to smoke a little bit this is probably for you and here's somebody that's a hardcore smoker and smokes a lot like I do it's probably not the ally you want to go down because you still feel yourself wanting to take a DAB or a bong hit or something it just doesn't fully do it for you so my official review for the Ursa liquid diamond sauce cards golden strawberry I'm honestly gonna have to give it a even 6 you know especially for the price I paid it does get you high don't get me wrong I got me you got me loaded but I'm just I expected a little more so and even 6 do what you want with that all right in this [ __ ] with a hoot and shoot everybody gotta stand up get you guys a function shot my badass rig alright hope you guys got your bunks packed blunts [ __ ] lit dad rigs ready all that [ __ ] smoke along with me tell me in the comment section what the [ __ ] you guys want me to review next or what you guys are smoking on I'm curious and thank you to all my supporters [Music] thank you guys for watching hope you enjoyed until next time smoking will small town [Music]", "MqiysJuXOAM": "well thanks for joining everyone today is another day of crushing ore but this or some very rare special ore let me show you all right so there's the ore yes it doesn't look like it's gold ore but it's actually called salvinite it's actually a gold and silver telluride mineral in which the ratio of the gold and silver atoms is commonly close to one and one you can only find this in five different places around the world uh canada australia is a couple other places but you can only find it in one spot in the united states and that is in colorado from the creek area so i ordered this offline i got three boxes from it i thought it was interesting that you know you're gonna find a one-to-one ratio of gold and silver within this stuff so majority of it came about this size or bigger so i had to crush it down to fit it into my crusher and i had a really good signal right at this point here let me show you okay so i'm using the falcon md20 this tool will find the smallest gold possible almost down to -100 in rock and and allow you to see if you got any particular metals inside your rock so let's get the sensitivity adjusted okay back off just a little bit all right so that's the x where i marked it if it goes in and makes a sound it is a non-ferrous metal gold sore other stuff if it makes a sound backing off it's iron and it does discriminate pyrite so you never have to worry about that setting it off but that signal is really good so this is the last piece i gotta break up and we'll see if we can see anything visually in there before i run it through the crosstre so we'll crush that rock up i had some spare wood for my last project so i just put my rock in there i slide that over with my foot and we'll break that down using that piece of equipment there and then i went ahead since i had some wood as i said i was gonna buy me a chain mill well this is the mighty mill i bought it's not a high production unit but it'll serve the purpose it's three chains of spin around in there break this all up feed tube discharge tube and then i got it going into a table that i built from that spare wood this allows me to put a bucket underneath help control some of the dust and this usually comes in and out so this is a 12 mesh and then we got a 50 mesh and a hunter mesh so we'll see how how well that works and i'm sure it'll probably get it all the way down to 100 but we're going to run that through there and try to get it all if we can down to at least plus 100 if not minus 100. all right so let's start by getting this rock crushed okay always wear a mask rather if you could find an n95 or a can 95 those are going to be the better ones to protect protect you from breathing in the dust from that there's that piece that has the x on it and i really don't see anything in there at least in the sun [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so okay let's see the results here pretty good actually got it down to about 1 8 i mean it might be a few larger pieces [Music] [Music] that's minus 50 plus 100 and minus 100 all right so looks like i need to invest in a vacuum system with this thing all right let's continue moving on okay so uh after that dusk cloud catastrophe i went out and purchased a dust deputy that fits in a five gallon bucket it was easy to assemble on top of a sealed lid and then i'm using my shop bag and connected to that might be a little powerful for this little machine but let me show you how effective this should work without the dust clouds it's basically all of the dust and all the debris should go through this vortex system drop it down and actually keep my filter on the shop vac clean so let me show you i'll turn the shop back on and you can watch the top of that [Music] so might be a little too powerful i'm not sure but if i have to reduce the power somehow i'll figure that out but let's try this obviously that's just enough suction power for me to not worry about the dust cloud so let's get this thing started and fed and see how it works [Music] so [Music] [Laughter] so [Music] you [Music] [Music] well dusty to me all right well that looks pretty good oh yeah wow okay well i mean you can feel a few chunks but i think it might be down at the bottom but come on most part geez this thing is ready to run [Music] yeah all right well still better than breathing it look how clean that looks pretty good actually there's very few pieces in there [Music] all right [Music] worked out great so money mill nice job you saw what i ran through it uh with any chain mill or any draw crusher or any ball mill you know if you can get some sort of dust collector to help out that makes a difference a lot better doing that so mighty mill thumbs up looks great works great and uh sure does be grinding it down yourself then it never hurts to buy something made in the usa well there you have it so that is a small mini gold ore crushing plant it's portable so you can do it in your backyard um if you got a generator you can run all the equipment you can take all that out into the field right on the mine site and run it right there that's the whole purpose and the idea so for eighteen hundred dollars or less you can have yourself which is really cheap uh gold crushing little mini plant so um i did run through that stuff and it's just you know a bunch of silver i didn't find very much gold in it but that wasn't the purpose the purpose is to get this system of mine down so um having that uh dust deputy dead make a huge difference in the dust in fact uh i'm assuming everyone's got a shop back at home so if you're including that with the dust deputy you're going to get your best results and safer too because you're not breathing in all that dust so if you are still interested in watching more of these gold ore videos i do have a couple more coming out i've got some more coming in from different places we still have that northern uh nevada stuff to go through i got four boxes of that so that probably be my next attempt on that we'll still get out and do some river videos but uh go ahead and like this video please subscribe if you're already subscribed i appreciate you and until the next video thanks for watching [Music] you", "CAdtEFU2oy0": "sup buddy welcome back you glad you found the place well I told y'all he's gonna give you a little how-to and what's up so that's what we're going to do in this one in the last video we showed you how to prep your material in your tubes so if you ain't watch that when you trying to do this you might want to go and check that out but now let's go ahead and get on with showing you how to how to do the rest of this so what you're gonna do we've told you in the last one go ahead and refreeze your tubes after you pack them that's them over there so we've real froze them for ya bout 12 hours get your tubes ready and you get your water boiling alright so you're gonna have your water boiling on the stove and then once that starts boiling here's where all the fun starts so we come out here always always always do this outside don't ever ever ever ever try to do this anywhere covered or under anything or yeah that's I mean I ain't go I usually you know you don't have any slick baggy clothes or none of that dumb  on you know what I mean like nothing that's gonna create sparks no flannels nothing like that rubber soled shoes try to keep to a minimum so what you're gonna do is you take your hot water you put it in your square big pyrex dish right so then we float the pan that we're blowing into onto the water alright so what you're gonna do is you just float your little pan in the hot water you get your tube alright so we got our tube here it's all frosty ready to go we got our rubber bands down just a little ways from the lip you know what I mean by our cap now for this fresh frozen stuff you're going to create a whole lot of pressure that's gonna build up and if you don't do it right you'll blow this filter in a hole bunch of material another out into your pan and you don't want that so what you do to prevent that is you take like a hose clamp all right and then take your bandana and you wrap it around the tube anyway and then you take your hose clamp and you put your hose clamp around where the rubber band is usually rubber band it's like a gasket to hold the in there all right and then you always want to take something them pop down in the hole I take a little tiny metal screwdriver and poke down in the hole and clean it out and that really helps but make sure you keep that hole cleaned out and then you just go ahead and you're in two cans to 300 milliliter cans of butane they're each one of these little tubes and then after you've ran your second can you just shake your tube out into that pan there like I said you'll have to change the hot water in here about every three tubes all right so after you get it ran out into the pan and you wait till they'll be you know probably just a couple minutes and then the liquid like the actual butane liquid that's in the pan will start to evaporate off because the butane starts to evaporate I like 32 degrees or boil off it like 32 degrees so it'll start bubbling real big and then once all of the liquid is out and you're just left with the jelly oil kind of then that's when you want to blow your next tube into there and I don't never blow more than you know in a box you get about six tubes there's 12 cans so I never put more than than 12 cans so six tubes in one one pan once you get more than that it just starts to kind of saturate and you're not really it's just too much to work with but don't just keep blowing and filling the pan up always run the the butane out let the butane purge off from the heat eat before you just fill the pan up that's how you have accidents always always always keep your fire extinguisher over there and keep your assistant decide so keep all your together all right so that'll be this one that's how to blow the the next one will go ahead and run you through a little bit about how to purge it come on back now stay safe", "IiSPnTrD7cw": "hello everyone send by heaven studio my name is hisela and i'm the founder and owner of send by heaven lc and simba heaven studio on youtube um today our video is to answer to our requests this person asks us to make embeds to show how to make the embeds and what colors and how to use the colors i have different type of molds here i have this coffee bean um this one is very nice to use especially if you're making like a drink um candle and you can add the coffee beans on top we have the peach the blueberries raspberries strawberries of course cherries more blueberries because i think you can never have too many blueberries is the most request um pie or the star candle i have that's why i always running out of strawberries or blueberries i'm always running out this one i use it for the oranges but you can see it has all different type of molds shapes that you can use to make other type of embeds this one is the teddy bears and also the lifesaver gummies i would say and the warm the lightsaber also you can use them to make the for the fruit through the loop um candles these are very good the shape is perfect i know the cereal is not perfect round but i like to use these ones all right so for embeds i normally recommend to use paraffin because biofin is a hotter wax a higher melt temperature of wax and it will hold more especially if you wanted to do it with in combination with gel wax is it has a better resistance to the heat as you pour the the gel wax on top and won't melt very quick or won't look messy when you when you do it especially with soy wax yeah no it's not a good combination between soy wax and gel wax it's not a good combination gel wax because of the temperature that it has to be poured it melts soy wax very quick paraffin can hold a little longer and it can hold and continue all his solid form and don't melt as you pour the gel wax okay so i already have my paraffin melting so i'm just gonna prepare the my little measuring cups so for the embeds i recommend to use always a small um measuring cup because they're very small so the portion of wax that you use is not as big as you're making a real candle so normally like not even probably two ounces of or wax will give you a lot of embeds depending on the size of it okay for the embeds you can also use um liquid dye you can use um the blocks or you can use the chips okay hold on a second okay now i got all my colors so the block this cranberry and also these are the chips this is also cranberry this is blue and this is burgundy and this is red this one is exactly this the only thing is that i uh i grade it to storage like this for me because i think it's easy for me to mix it and i dissolve quickly then adding the block now i have the white and the black liquid dye i haven't seen blackened chips but it's always good to have a black liquid dye especially for those colors like the blueberries because if you are just blue um it will be a simple blue but you know the blueberries are kind of like like purpley blue it's it's a very different blue so if you want to give that tone you can add a little bit just a drop of the black and that will turn the color a little darker [Music] the peach the liquid dye peach it's a little darker kind of like this color when you pour so i recommend i normally blend it a little bit with white so i'm gonna start pouring so right now i only need i need blueberries also i wanna show you for the cranberries if you're making a cranberry pie or cranberry drink um you can still use the blueberries as the blueberry moles as the cranberry you just change the color so i'm gonna make the peach i'm gonna make blueberries cranberries strawberries and cherries i just recently make about a a batch or raspberry so i'm not gonna use it and i'm not gonna use this one's either okay okay now we're gonna make the blueberries we have our half a cup of paraffin wax we're gonna use our you can use navy blue the darkest blue you have and the temperature right now is 1.99 we're gonna mix our blue okay we're gonna add one drop of black we're gonna mix it be sure you mix it properly we're going to do our test for embeds i always recommend to test the color so that way you get the best color possible so right now i'm gonna let it sit so i can show you guys i'm going to pour our blueberries just here you guys can see on the back there the other end bits are starting to cool up very quick and look i didn't even notice a little one of these don't worry if you go outside the mold you want to try not to spill it outside them all but sometimes it happens because they're really small so the precision to pour and every but every one of them is sometimes it can be challenging even if you have you've been making it for a long time still so you have to learn not to worry about those things like that anyway whatever left over outside you always can take it off scrape it off and put it back in the container and melt it for the next one for the next batch so here's the blueberries okay everyone um we're back our blueberries all set normally it took 45 minutes to an hour for them to dry get all set because once again paraffin is a wax that cools up very quick and compared to other waxes so like i tell you before if you spread a little bit of wax around the the mold don't worry about it what you just do is you just kind of make a little bit of pressure and they will break apart and whatever is there and you can just whatever comes out you can put it back on the jar so you can re-melt it so it doesn't go to waste okay right so i'm gonna keep breaking here i normally like to use my my carving tools to make the process quickly you can use your hands that's their work quickly for me once you scrape all the wax it's easy to get them out the perfect shape everything else is back on the container so to be remote and reuse so once again from the bottom of your mold you're gonna make pressure push and you're gonna grab you're gonna push and grab push and grab push and grab push and grab you will have a little bit of shrinking on the back that's normal from paraffin and because there's very small pieces and normally that's the but this is the bottom part it doesn't make sense to top it because you will be giving yourself more work oh okay once you take up all your blueberries there you have it to do two minutes we're gonna remove this on the microwave okay so we have our blueberry melt already again i put it two minutes i still have some wax that i didn't know completely so between two minutes to to two and a half minutes and what it will do depending on the amount of wax that you're using so now i keep pouring again say don't worry about if you drip a little probably half of the whole mold will complete that that amount but there you have it once you do it once the rest is just repeat the same step okay everyone i want to thank everybody um for watching and hope you like this video this is my fruit salad in bed um i make a few separate videos for few of them so that way um the video doesn't get too long and it's easy to understand the mixing of the colors okay so these are our cherries our strawberries our blueberries our cranberries and our peaches so these are perfect for you to make um dessert dessert candles or make your cocktail candles and even to decorate um other type of candles if you had cupcakes put a strawberry on top or cherry on top whatever you want um be creative have fun you can see this is very simple to do a little time consuming yes but it's fun to do so once again um if you have any questions please comment below i will respond to you as soon as i can and also i recently created a facebook group for candle making and soap making i still haven't get into the soap making so but i i have a few members there that are very um they have experience about soap making in body products so every time if you have a question if that's what you want to do you can join the group candle makers the next um the next level candle maker that's the name of the group i'm going to put the link also i'm going to show you and remember you um that use always a sample create a sample of your colors so that way you're sure that that's the color that you want for your embeds sometimes just pouring colors doesn't give the best result so the better taste and it will depend start with a little then move forward if it's if you need a darker then you add more or add color black to make a darker or you can add white to make it lighter i will put a link on on the link of the die the color dies that i use and also where you can find some of the molds that i use as well okay so thank you once again thank you for watching please stay safe stay strong stay blessed bye", "ktNN_OGa1wU": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today today we're going to be doing a little bit of a review on some mammoth labs LA wedding cake crossed with sherbert OG these are some Terp

there it is all right that is some very nice-looking extract pop the lid off this is a hard plastic lid much harder than the softer silicone of some other products this is the new farm so I'm being a little bit picky at it has a very nice earthy aroma to it I'm not getting much of the wedding cake but a little bit of the funk from the sherbert alright that is some very nice-looking stuff all right the only a very turbid crystalline in structure a nice little rock right there all right well this has a some numbers here looking at about eighty percent THC THC am eighty nine point nine but total cannabinoids of eighty point eight for no pesticides were used in making this this was extracted with pho pho alright grow browse where the producer and the processor all right well I'm excited about this one and I'm looking forward to trying it out let's get this topside see we've got to work with so here we are back on top with our mammoth labs la wedding-cake cross with sherbert OG I am really excited about this this is the first time I'll be trying this product there are a new vendor to our store and I always get excited whenever I get to try something new especially something that has a lineage like wedding cake and sherbert two of my all-time top strains that being said you saw when it was down there this has extremely nice crystalline structure has a very wet Terp appearance and this is running a THC a percentage of 89.9% very nice no oh let's get a good smell on this too we're working with oh very nice ah has has has gone to a a very very subtle skunk mixed with a little bit of wood kind of an oakiness kind of a skunky funky oakiness but on the high end you can taste just a little bit of that would be the sherbert that funk that you're smelling there from the top lid you get just a little bit of a almost lemon but really a vanilla just a hint that's the wedding cake very complex but it is actually it is nice it's there both of those should come out really well in the in the innovate very nice light color extremely crystalline structure it's not the easiest to work with if you don't have a scoop but I think everything else is gonna make up for that let's try this out Cheers mammoth labs wedding cake crust with server doji turf diamonds very smooth hmm with that second one that wedding cake really comes out a lot the funk it book rules it over right in the beginning get a conservative a ver then on the exhale went on the reflection kind of a little bit of sweetness very nice um well this it's a very complex product but they did it very well um these

actually this uh the wrong or wait the raw garden is mine this dizzy is his but we decided we're gonna try both of these in the video and yeah let's just we're not gonna be comparing we're just gonna try both of them and doing a little session with both of them but as usual with this i like to have randy open them hold on let me just also comment in the section below what you guys are smoking on not like that don't comment like that all right so what what is this [ __ ] that's right truffle sundae uh they said it was a new drop uh so all right i just got to text my bag guys but yes or the bat at the bottom where it is that's right so uh just like in the club i did ask if uh what crosses this was and i'm just gonna assume that it's something crossed with sunday driver which is one of my favorite strains or one of my more you know like strains but yeah open it with a sticker on top so yeah this was a 29 out the door at authentic 209 guys very well priced here you know i know you know

purple honeysuckle i do have this for san diego so here's this um but once again like to thank rj for uh letting us use his his uh rig for this video and also coming with me to the dispensary because you know going to the dispensary by yourself it's just i don't know sometimes you need a second opinion you know what i'm saying so you got anything to say but go subscribe y'all just go subscribe stay tuned more videos from us on the way [ __ ] it's 20 20. stay inside okay all right rj have a good day guys subscribe alright peace out [Music] you", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "LDW8cDXRFgU": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "napvMPfsQUY": "hey guys it's ina today i will be teaching you how to make a blueberry smoothie for blueberry smoothies for blueberry smoothie you need blueberries the most important thing and you need a 150 to 150 ml of strawberry milk if you don't have strawberry milk you can use strawberries i'm just adding these for the taste if you don't want to add them it's fine so and you need a blender to blend things so i'll just be back with blender and i'll add the strawberry milk okay so i added the strawberry milk one and then we have the blueberries that's done and then we add the second cup of strawberry juice or milk i added the first one before the blueberries now i'm adding the next one after the blueberries so it's like this and i'll be back showing you how it looks like okay so it will look like this i know it looks weird with eyeballs sticking out it looks like eyeballs but it's going to be purple in color and tastes amazing so i'll just be back after blending this is how it looks after one batch of mixing now we'll do one more time till it's all mixed and then it's we'll put them in the glass i've mixed it for two times and the bubbles are much smaller now so now we'll convert them in glasses i just use this cup with the strawberry milk i used to put in it so i don't waste cups so here it goes doesn't that look delicious and i will be if you want to add ice you can add ice and i'll just add the ice i have the eyes and this is how it looks doesn't it look delicious and this is how they look i hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did smash that like button subscribe and comment down below if you want more videos like this bye", "bVzGx2sC1j8": "all right so we're doing a review here of select elite live and what we got left of it really and this strain was cherry a Kay with lemon tree and I thought it tasted great tasted way better and then select regular carts the hardware is still the seesaw m60 which is the plastic see so I prefer the glassy sell but which is the th - but still this is good it still performs well taste is really good strength is pretty good what do you think about it yeah I think those really good yeah how about strength and just you know to compare from stuff from the same week would you say kanji is better yeah we just these kanji just came up the other day and these were 2 for 40 and of course these were at a different location even different state these are at the dispensary and I just thought that was better than the Select alive and I thought kanji was better than a lot of the cartridges we recently had that's really an excellent quality thing but just as a comparison if you happen to hit the to slightly live compared to the West Coast cure live resin which one did you like better you liked this bed in the West Coast care so we got the West Coast cure live resin and yeah I would say like this better a little bit too it's a it seems a little bit stronger right yeah taste is pretty comparable maybe taste barely a little better but strength seems to be a little bit from out more pronounced on that and so I'm go ahead take a hit that saw and see if it's on yeah really light and smooth huh and the effects were energetic and you know this is another thing like this is 94% THC but we had a car early that was 80 that was better so it's like the THC percent is not everything but I've noticed is the icing carts in the 80s tend to be the best there's some of the great ones in the 90s usually the 70s ones do feel a little weaker but I feel like the 80 seems to be kind of like the sweet spot for the right mixture of things for the most part and this seems good you had another Daggett half-life resin I mean it's good it's just not the absolute best I think the strength on the distillate the the effect the hit the stone eNOS was a little more in the distillate have you tried the Select leave distill it Stan I thought the the silat there's a little more stony than this one but especially people to like them additional effects they tend to like the live resin more so select live great product not the absolute best not my absolute fave buy resin I would say better than the West Coast cure live resin MPX live resin was better use live resin was better and but it's still a really good product and I think it's better tasting their distill it but I think they're still it is stronger and still one of the strongest ones out there so that's it anything to add would you give it two thumbs up yeah me too alright thanks for watching and you'll have a great week", "ZS6N6LJmUmA": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we're back again for another constant rate review we're actually taking a look at some more rosin from 7-10 labs today we really enjoyed that GMO we checked out last week we figured [ __ ] let's do another one we've actually got the Layla number six right here yeah that's right this is the lair of number six and it does not have gelato in it guys it's got via Sheila and the Sputnik two strains I have never heard of like Dan said finally some not gelato for once this but Nick is a [ __ ] I looked it up a little while ago I forget road down Apollo 13 and Black Russian cross so the Leila overall is definitely gonna be indica dominant I guess but you know pretty much a hybrid I'm going on a dad here right away yes so I've got this a few times honestly I'm not gonna lie there are some videos where I do take the first step on camera with you guys this stuff I couldn't resist after I tried the GMO I had to try the Lela and I gotta say this stuff packs a punch as well but the flavor is not quite as crazy as as the GMO I mean that's just I feel like that's just because of the terpene profile on the flower the starting material itself that being said this stuff does pack a punch although smooth it's very smooth and I think it's honestly stronger than the GMO effect wise so I'm gonna confirm that right here with some more come on say right now this is some of this new add as smooth as any rosin or almost any extract I've ever smoked yeah yeah let me get let me actually get my key pre-heat that last little ooh good that shows me that it's good this isn't necessarily my typical turf but it is interesting yeah so I need to do a little more analysis on this stuff right here but as you look at it it's meaty right yeah I don't know sorry I froze up it's very very you know they buttered up overnight on us just like the other stuff so the consistency is different than at what I'm looking at right now is different than what I was looking down a few nights ago this one I had already started to butter up a little bit in the corner whereas the other one was still completely translucent you know yeah but you know it still looks amazing the color on all of 7/10 stuff lately has just been amazing super blonde super by almost whitish it's the best part about them doing everything under one roof taking the plants from start to finish all the way through is they can kind of grow strains for like you know set this part of the room up you know with screens that you lift that you love running for Ross and then run them amount of time that you like running forward rosin get the resin itself exactly the way you want it okay now this part of the room we're gonna run these trains for live resin and sauce in this type of [ __ ] okay now we're gonna run these for full mouth we're gonna do rosin from these mint it's just it's pretty dope what they're doing over there being able to do everything kind of under one roof yeah you know full vertical vertical integration over there and just I feel like we've said it before but I'll say it again seven to ten laps right now in California is kind of a model for what where everybody's trying to do I mean yeah they're killing it says right on their packaging that's produced out of Oakland I believe they grow in Oakland as well up I believe they just have a facility there that's all in one pretty much grow and extraction and they do everything there from you know their BHO to their cultivation to the rosin and you know shout out man like like you guys I think know that you know we always give credit where credit is due even though it's friendly competition it's that's all it is is friendly competition and shout out to them yeah yeah I mean it's tough enough to just do one thing right just to kill it with a flower line right just to kill it with a concentrate line just one type of concentrate they're really firing well with every single thing that they dabble their hands into I've been nothing but impressed with all their product that I've tried like we said from the flower to you know that concentrates everything else yeah you know the everything looks clean as far as the packaging the presentation when you talk about prices when you when you talk about you know the top quality type stuff it's always going to be higher prices but when I talk about prices I think more in terms of like the competition like if they if you sell an $80 gram how good is that a dollar gram compared to the other 80 grams on shelves at different shops you know in the same market and I feel like with 7:10 the quality is always just as good if not a little bit better than the competition at pretty much whatever price point you're shopping out in a hole that you score Oh gotcha I had no idea what he was just talking about coming a lot a great point great point sir oh she just blasted right here on the inside packaging says quality drives every decision we make garden to the lab to the jar that holds your stash happiness you flip open the other one it says oh geez make better oh gee oh man whatever this is I don't know what the two strengths in going in are but like you said it's very mean teens it's almost got a cush after tasting going on which I love it's very floral right very floral like I get the mint floral kind of maybe like like woody notes or something when I when I smell this mm-hmm but when I when I smoke it the flavor that I'm getting was super heavy on the minty cool yeah so this is gonna be hard to judge from the honesty 9 cos you know we say we say that we smoke for flavor which we do but sometimes I do smoke for that punch to the face and I'm not gonna lie I came into this video I offer dad with his stuff and I'm a little off I feel like and this stuff just makes me feel whoa and you know a little goofy trying to pick my words right here okay I do a little bit more research just it makes me really goofy and laughy it gives you that laffy high so I love this so what I was getting at is like we gave the other stuff of ten the GMO and this stuff doesn't quite taste as good but in my opinion it packs a much heavier punch so I mean it doesn't taste as good but it gets what question would you say that taste is the toughest one to rate accurate or to give a rating that you feel confident be confident in because there's more personal preference involved in that than maybe some of the other ones at least that's how I feel when I talk about how something tastes I'm well aware that there's certain flavor profiles that I just gravitate towards naturally like over and over through years of smoking weed like I really like meat it like this I really don't tend to like stuff like this but I know a lot of other people I dish it right so how do I go about rating the flavor sometimes you know well yeah and everybody I believe has a different like palette and different taste buds right I'm not much of a genealogist or wherever you call it but yeah I'm more of a gentleman than scholar oh yeah exactly I got some type of degree but anyways my point being is I'm gonna get into rating this stuff because I feel I got dab did enough he's gonna do some more analysis over there I'm gonna give this stuff a 9.5 and that's really hard for me to do because it's got me really high I'm like kind of sweaty around the eyes a little bit on the nose but it's 9.5 because I smoked for flavor and I thought about that overnight and what my consensus was gonna be what my conclusion be and that's the one I came to so that's why I'm I'm edging the GMO over this but this definitely does if you're looking for that kick to the forehead I believe this one gives you more of that in the GMO but for that news that I'm giving it a 9.5 because it doesn't have the flavor that the GMO has yeah I'm high as a kite I'm ready get out of here honestly so I hope he's ready I hope his analysis is complete and I hope he has their complete II know what what processing processing oh it's it's what is it car buffering he's buffering buffering 9.41 - Oh a nine point four one two coming in with a nine point four one - Wow very smooth very heavy loving the buzz on this one while flavor I can't give a ten I don't know if it's personal preference I don't know about packs when you break it all down nine point four one two don't sit I'm like that's going for digit soon I think that's down to the thousand good either man hundred about there's some crazy equations and can different types of math concepts and calculations I had to draw forward to come up with that but I'm confident in it 99.5 use 9.5 that's sorry I rosin mm-hmm ash 710 Shane Danny all right Celie later subscribe yeah hit the buttons do all that do that stuff yep and then or a bang hua hit you in the chest like Stockton wheat - Wow homie I'm here I'm talking triple splash like my name klay Thompson get up on the mic and I'm Charles Bronson on the blacktop playing the whips called a matchbox ragtop rolling with the gas in the stash spot real one since I came up at the sandbox no gang got the game on pad", "sqvHlTH6nqE": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video get up rise and Erie today and grab me some goji goji goji goji one gram of the go GOG I did pay a hefty $96 for one gram of this go GOG by Moxie yeah 96 bucks do they are taxing but as you guys know Moxie is fired probably the best that's the best concentrate you can get his moxie I liking the best probably prime and pharmaceutical rx so right there in a close second as far as quality Moxie's the best go GOG and I said and this is coming in at a total of ninety point five nine percent cannabinoids eighty seven point seven five THC a right there let's get this bad boy open get a few dabs I did get me a new torch I bought the torch with the the automatic lighter on it igniter pretty good these work way better then them little tiny torches butane ones you buy it head chops they're like that big they suck and then you go out and like it leaked just to last you at least a couple weeks even for heavy dabbers maybe a month if you don't have much but I go to them about every couple of weeks cuz I be dabbing heavy so it was that all right go GOG one gram of the sugar [Music] cool funky funky look at the go GOG sugar as one DRAM as a nice hefty pile there looks like a gram to me get you another zoom in close-up look at that that is go GOG buy Moxie 90% cannabinoids a couple dabs of this and let you know what I think of the go GOG I did have this before so I you know that's so I know it's good is I had it before it was really good was one of the first ones I've ever bought by Moxie was go GOG when I first got my medical marijuana card that's true story so this is my little works good get the snow he's a little fast let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know if you've had the go GOG by Moxie before I like to burn off a lot of the old stuff get it red hot and burn off down a little [ __ ] yeah this is coming in this is a hybrid we got to tell you that it was packaged on 514 of 2020 so really fresh got stuff we set my little timer here yeah so 514 it was packaged it's pretty fresh live resident sugar not too big of a DAB a little dab you try it out small go small first Cheers go GOG buy moxie Wow got a nice very nice flavor it kind of reminds me a little bit of the Alpine og similar to that with a little bit more pining this to it it almost tastes like the lemon OG x Alpine OG it's kind of close to that kind of similar to that for me but this has a lot more like heightening flavor to that very good though go GOG very nice let me get another dab and use my other dab tool over here switch up to a cold tool we'll get it a nice that's a little bit fatter a little fatter bugger there on there look at that one we do that one now that's a pretty fat one decent size I'm so used to having a lighter I always go to reach for my lighter because I just got this like yesterday and I'm still new to me that I don't need a lighter anymore because mostly I use vape pens and now with this no lighter needed anymore kinda I always go for a reach for my lighter and I'm like wait something different do another job that you dived for you guys on this video I don't want to make it too long and it said it was a hybrid go gog giving you the basics one gram I paid $96 for the gram I did have five dollars off eight points so I paid ninety one dollars for some reason the grams are priced $96 really uneven number for some reason but it's how they do it at least eerie rise that's how they do it nice and hot set what timer I like sitting a timer because it gives me an exact I know that when I heat my when I heat my thing one over here a bowl up to red-hot that forty seconds gives me a perfect cooldown time you know trial and error so depends though if you get a cheat that's a cheap banger if you get a better quality banger probably might stay hotter longer but I bought this one for seven dollars a smoker friendly yeah Cheers let me know what you guys are smoking on smoking on the go GOG by moxie excellent that's got a really good flavor but really like pop and the flavor pops highly recommended if you haven't tried it try it go GOG by Moxie it's fire that when I'm really feeling it after doing that second dad it's coming on pretty heavy [Music] like I said thanks for subscribing hit the like hit the subscribe if you haven't subscribed thanks you

dabbing on down in the comment section thanks I'm out go GOG for the weekend", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "oQhItiXuOJ0": "[Music] parents look closely at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs

minutes just to get back so that these were all garden carts then Nick he got some unique [ __ ] never tried these the Cresco tell me if you guys ever tried them if they're good in the comments you know if you try the cress goes and and you know if you tried the rolls I've never tried to roll I don't even know how to open this box man it looks confusing us [ __ ] probably not even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I don't know what do you want to do we gotta go outside can be smoking it so we're gonna try this real quick behold alright so we're gonna try out the banana OG first I don't know if I'm gonna try the next one yet but well I mean we're gonna try it another video so that's what it looks like it's focused [ __ ] persona raw garden pin now we got to get the Earth's opinion when is the Ursa pin coming first I tell me in the comments come on [Music] alright guys here goes I'm not gonna lie this [ __ ] is [ __ ] shits ding this shit's powerful it tastes like legit just straight wax was put in there you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far though I like the Ursa this shit's pretty dim did you like it what would you take [Music] you heard it you heard them that shit's [ __ ] powerful here you go bro oh yeah we got the Cresco [ __ ] we're gonna pair it

time I smokes dizzy my chest started hurting so yeah but they're consistent but um we're gonna try this one the mindo punch I don't know if you guys can see miss mindo punch [Music] press this two sides in and push up and looks like they did it right ether Springs on my [ __ ] [ __ ] oh I see yes the springs all right let me just take one more hit of this that Ursa Oh shit's good fighting online that's just good I like how the oh it tastes just cuz it tastes like straight wax I don't have my tripod that's why I'm doing this right now sorry see what he done bro neither did oh that [ __ ] is nice to be smoking in there sorry about the background noise dude I'm have to go with the car to be honest look beyond that why just cuz I like how it tastes like it's how the punishing I mean but I'm not gonna [ __ ] throw her and you know stood that the robber so I love mm I was like oh I gotta go because someone else hit me up and made me go to a movie or something baby I love you I don't know maybe this won't even make the video but [Music]", "qEMW1qArR98": "yeah today there's something weird happening by the way you read this i think this happened to a few streamers that are sponsored you see that 1 10 19 million 31 310 834 diamonds got deducted from my balance and they literally gave out streamers 12 20 20 million diamonds to spend and then some some streamers got it and then they instantly spend it all like they went to like real streams like any streams live stream they would they just gifted them airplanes right new cushions in gameplay maybe i've been playing that [ __ ] for a while cushion skin yeah so these people get oi oh my god [ __ ] so these people got free diamonds and they literally went to live streams and then spent it on airplanes like hundreds of airplanes to one people bro one person and now now they got deducted because it's illegal like illegal to spend it i guess the policy wise so now they are balanced in their um balance in the count is like negative negative like tens of thousands of diamonds negative i didn't spend it because it's obviously [ __ ] up something weird bro why would you spend that so stupid would you spend it if you get like 90 million diamonds i mean you would probably buy skins because they're not going to take the skins away they're going to minus your balance so if you do if it happens to you just buy all the skins and then i don't know bro leave it um negative balance forever bro so look at this thanks for support so they gave me 20 million diamonds and then they took it away and your current diamond 20 million diamonds bro 20 million but why is it deducted well technically it's mooton's fault for giving out these diamonds in the first place they're supposed to give out the right amount but they i think they [ __ ] up the calculation so people got the diamonds they didn't even know what happened so they just spent it all like how would you spend it's like it's like mr b youtube video he gives you a million dollar and tells you to spend in three sec like one minute what would you do so this is what happened to them they literally got 20 million so they have to spend it before munton finds out so they went on live streams just pressed that [ __ ] airplane and then that now they have negative balance yo kiwi thanks for the donation welcome but the thing is it's kind of hard hard to tell because first place in the first place [ __ ] up by giving them so much but then are you playing chess today oh maybe yeah yeah i think so but then they spend it stupidly so i guess whose fault is it do you think they should give them the refund please for all the diamonds that they spend just forgive them and remove the negative balance or just stay with the negative balance i don't know man the enemy is banning yeah it is muthan's fault for giving them but you know it's like same in real life so somebody accidentally send you the money like 20 million dollar and then you take it out i think i think that's illegal to take it out even though it seems like should be legal because they send me the money i think you have to like pay back or something i think something like that even though you get the money like i don't know to be honest i didn't spend it because i didn't check it if i knew bro how to [ __ ] spend it all too [ __ ] no cap i'll buy every skit actually i skin all the skin i'll just um go to live stream just put that [ __ ] airplane only if i knew earlier bro out it was so much fun with it god damn it tosu grump thanks for the nation bro [Music] you", "LUMpcX9flK0":

fire gee you know that's no stress we ain't [ __ ] old boo no Bammer shut up okay here you go let it get warmed up for y'all sorry", "nxlld7RYbgk": "hi welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "J40U6akTHNs": "[Music] what is up y'all p2p and today we're doing a video of the osmo pocket one of our newer cameras we're gonna be using and uh yeah so this one might be moving around a bit no not really too stationary type stuff as i mess around with the osmo while we're filming and stuff but yeah but today guys i've got the skittles punch buddies cart review for you guys you know as always it's the but not as always but as it's been recently we've got another liquid diamonds buddies right here maybe we'll go for a distillate next time we get buddies but yeah they're working with about 70 thc on this one 74.72 total cannabinoids and uh you know an indica strain so you know it's definitely right up the alley for me so uh terpium profile let's go ahead and look at that we got an 8.56 percent profile not too amazing but nothing too low either uh you know some mirror scene in there karyofleen and limonene let's see back in there for y'all hope you all can see that yeah without further ado let's get this video started the right way and the way we always do with for those of you at home if you are packing up your dabs getting that already or you got your cart pin already ready right there right next to you i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit of this and i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting what i might be feeling [Music] creamy uh sweet sweetness there not too creamy i guess but um almost like a tart sweetness there um not too much of anything else you know that limonene that's in there i'm not really tasting it as pronounced as i did in that banjo cartridge but um i'm getting very very light hints of it so it's not exactly absent all the way but it isn't as pronounced so that's all the flavor notes i'm picking up here let me go ahead and take another hit for you guys real quick here and let you guys know what i'm thinking that one partially went down the wrong way [Music] so that hurt a little bit so what am i picking up there so now the limiting standing a little bit more you know i'm getting a little more of that limey citrusy kind of taste but it's still like again i said not as pronounced i'm not sure if you guys would even pick it up if you weren't really trying to hunt for it like i am and you know the only reason i'm really hunting for is to see if i could taste the terps that are listed here in the back you know i use them for the most part but um you know for a straightness at skills punch i was expecting more of a sweet kind of uh taste to it a lot sweeter than what i have here um but it's still not too bad so far potency wise it's okay so i've had i have hit this card a few times this isn't the first time recording this video um but uh yeah it's it's not the craziest like buddies card i've had you know this is indica it's pretty relaxing i wouldn't say like other ones it's sedating this one's more relaxing and mellowing which is too bad at all maybe that's just how the strain is but you know i'm assuming it skills punches across of skittles and purple punch so um me personally i was hoping that this would hit a little bit harder on the indian side but it's still not too bad though 74 total cap noise isn't it's not crazy a crazy amount of uh you know cabin rates and as we all know you know the higher capital percentage is actually what you want to look for rather than a higher thc percentage i mean you know thc percentage is also very good to look at but you know you want more full spectrum stuff more cannabinoids [Music] and once again i'm getting more of the tones the sweet and limey tones as i hit it more i think this is something that you won't taste much when you first hit it but um you know after like you sesh with it a little bit or maybe you know when you're sitting there and feeling like 2p hits and you'll taste a little bit more on the second third hit which is a little bit rare because generally speaking we normally expect cards to get harsher or darker towards the end you know but uh that remains to be seen with this one it's not to say that once it reaches the bottom it's it's gonna still taste better and better you know what i mean like it could definitely do what i just talked about before um yeah in terms of high impotency it's very mellow you know i definitely i mean i can go out and talk to people and hang out while i have this but it's definitely not really not no energizing yeah that's all i have for today's review guys i hope you guys enjoyed this quick little informal one and uh yeah i hope you guys bear with me while i still get everything figured out with my green screen set up with new cameras and all that stuff but i want to thank you guys for joining me and always and kick it in here so if you did enjoy this

you should dab or how much chatter you should share off remains an ongoing issue and will be the stoner whose jar of bubble hash opens in their bag or whose vape oil canister breaks in their pocket luckily Portland's Iowa vapor has devised a really clever solution NAB taps each of these little ceramic pellets is infused with 50 milligrams of cannabis concentrate they won't break leak sweat or spill their THC rich contents and they're extremely easy to use simply drop a tab onto your dab Briggs nail or set it in the heating crucible of your preferred vaporizer and heat it up as until it warms the concentrate trapped inside will slowly boil off for you to inhale and since each tab contains five standard doses you'll have enough for a full session in each if not just add another tab plus while the pellets released their THC cargo they visibly char and pit making it easy to judge how many draws you have left before they're fully spent the real genius of DAB cabs is their portability and versatility they're functionally inert until you heat them up so there is effectively zero risk of them spilling or leaking what's more they can be used in any vaporizer that accepts loose-leaf or wax based concentrates during my testing the tabs work smoothly with the puff coke peak the Storz and Bickel mighty the PAX 3 and the vape exhale cloud Evo heck you can even put it in your pipe and smoke it if you're off in mind I especially appreciated that I could start and stop sessions at will without repercussion with conventional rigs if you inadvertently use more oil than you meant to or have a bigger hunk of hash than you can handle your stock muscling through the bowl until it's either cashed or you're left to stone a useless heap on the couch both dab tabs which can be subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles without any noticeable change of taste in the vapor you can set the pipe down and back up off it at your convenience this combined with the tabs set 50-milligram can ability all contents makes monitoring and managing your dosage a far more simple affair than with existing concentrates the rule of what you scrape is what you vape thankfully no longer apply though they're quite handy dab tabs are not perfect for one you're gonna have a heck of a time trying to find them before next February ILO is partnering with local concentrate suppliers and it's soft launched at select dispensaries throughout Oregon they hope to expand distribution to California Nevada and Maryland early next year what's more since the infusion process requires extra labor and materials expect to pay a premium on top of what you normally would for that gram of hash still you can't put a price on convenience and boy are these ever convenient [Music]",

going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're for maxi but really appreciate you guys watching my videos you guys stay tuned for more I'm gonna be

militarian jewelry and i'm here together with matthew hi to announce that we are very excited that we have uh decided to enter the eco-friendly lab-grown diamond market and it's a space that matthew and i are very passionate about aren't we absolutely i think it's a massive uh opportunity massive opportunity i think it's something that will change the trade will change the industry absolutely absolutely i think it can only get better when you can get the millennials in where you can get other people coming in getting really appreciating jewelry you know what i mean instead of silver little bracelets and trinkets they can actually appreciate a beautiful diamond the only difference is this diamond is the it's grown in the lab rather than in the earth otherwise it's exactly the same atomically it's exactly exactly the same it's hardness what it's made out of it's amazing this is an amazing product gotcha and i can't see it being any negative about it you know not only will big engagement rings be more common for for the for everyone now much more accessible tennis braces you know we've got tennis braces in our range they're from one carat total up into 11 carats the affordability makes them amazing and it's an everyday sale now yeah you know the studs are fantastic we're sending them in nine and 14 carat you know we've got 20 points up into a carrot each you know and we're not talking big dollars yeah tell me like it's i can't see why shops wouldn't jump on board the profit margins are amazing yeah you know going for what 10 20 if you're lucky for a mine you get 40 percent of these yeah that's unheard of plus the ring it's out of control so we've gone decided to go really large into this and i'd rather spend my money on this than silver yeah you know this stuff helps pay the rent you know so we're doing loose stones we're doing rings finished rigs the finished rings are amazing right the price is fantastic all right so we're doing that we're doing studs tennis bracelets so we're coming out with bangles or also decided to come out with rings without the center stone but the side stones are still mine because the price difference isn't that much in the small in the smalls yeah but then you put the big center in there and all of a sudden these girls who you know these millennials have only got 5 000 to spend can get a carrot yeah plus the ring like it's ridiculous so ridiculously good absolutely absolutely it makes it just jewelry is sparkly again it's not it's not you know it's not so price oriented when people come in and look for silver these guys can spend their two three thousand dollars and get a diamond piece yeah you know what i mean and it's fantastic you know we've sold smalls we're selling large so when you say large what are we doing with the loose stones what do we do well we're doing well we can go up to six seven carats but so we're finding the 1.2 up until the 2.4 2.5 is where it's working okay probably because it's so cheap yeah we're doing rounds ovals everything everything there are all the shapes all the shapes we're fine we're finding that now emeralds and radiants are coming in everyone's asking for emeralds and raisins cert igi but very very excited probably the first in australia to bring out the gia sets with these lampgrounds i've got about half a dozen to a dozen coming in it's ranging from efd color triple excellence very good these things are amazing right are amazing the price difference is considerable compared to igi but you get a much better stone with the gia obviously um but we're finding any colored stones i've done a lot of pinks the pink round looks amazing right we've done a couple of canary yellows um and it's been fantastic there's ice blues coming as well there's greens there's dark blues like it just brings a whole new level to it yeah you know it's ridiculous and the shops that have got on board how have you found it look this i've found the response whoever has jumped on board has sold them no question i sold a lot of the tennis braces seemed to be walking out the door the finish rings i was here gonna have half a dozen to a dozen to show you they gone with pendants are coming most of them are sold there's full diamond uh left green diamond bands they're coming in we've found anyone who's jumped on board has done well with them and we offered a really exclusive um opportunity to some of these clients in which they purchased whatever they purchased i would give them loose stones on approval too and that's worked very well long term well as long as if i need them i'll grab them back and then give them something else yeah um but most of them i've had people question asking about it and we're talking about two two and a half carat there's a two carat 12 heart shape someone's got that there's a 2.4 round that's massive they've got that so it's just trying to um give clients extra you know because adding value to them yeah and at the end of the day we work with each other their success is our success 100 so as far as i'm concerned if we can help each other out why wouldn't you why wouldn't you but i just found it you know it's been awesome it's been a really awesome experience so far uh very passionate about it i love it yeah absolutely love it", "CKuRVp94U3A": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in respectmyregion.com

let's see infused indoor rocket fuel live resin infused and i think it would appear that there's also keef on the outside so let's check this out shall we 1.3 grand pre-roll this is the lit version 2. what do we got delta 9 thc 301.76 aka 30.18 thc on the percentage total cbd 0.5 packaged and manufactured on the same day december 9th 2020. so check this out you guys all right let's get into the pre-roll now oh a little fresh tube nice i like it they fresh sealed it to protect the terps and it is in fact coated in a keef so i am excited this is going to be a good one touch it a little bit it doesn't feel like it's packed too tightly i'm gonna i'm gonna give stevie the benefit the doubt here okay tastes like sweet pine definitely tastes like og's inside of here um to say what kind of live resin it says rocket fuel is the live resin so here we go one hit we'll talk about it two hits i'll give you a 4 out of 10 on the taste test 3 and 4 hits i'll give you guys a score out of 100 in terms of the overall um you know experience and a bunch of other categories that we've come up with so here we go first hit you guys wow she's bubbling but you get the live resin right away you get the sweet sweet flower wow this is potent oh wow this is like the first pre-roll that i've hit that had me say holy [ __ ] wow you can see it bubbling every time you rip it you've got a ring of the of the resin as you pull it down wow i feel myself getting more and more high with every breath almost um in terms of the taste it nailed it the dry hit the reel it tasted like a sweet og the rocket fuels the live resin you get a sweet gas wow stizzy this is incredible this is probably the best indoor uh i'm sorry this is probably the best infused pre-roll that i've i've ever had damn i might be i might have to say that before i can confirm though at least taste wise i definitely think it is i definitely think this is the best uh one i've had now in terms of the rest of the experience and the high and stuff like that we got to get there here we go score wise out of 10 on the taste i'm gonna give this a nine uh i'm gonna give this i don't see a reason to it's not even harsh i'm gonna give this a 10 out of 10 on the taste this is just absolutely incredible i mean the the the way the only way that this could get better is if this dizzy og was literally the marathon og or if it was ember valley's og or if it was king's guard emoji just someone that i was like so hyped on that's the only way that this would get better to me this og tastes delicious and it being keep coated it's not even harsh the white ash this is a very impressive product it did come in a little bit expensive i want to say it was between 24 and 28 maybe somewhere like maybe it was 28 i'm not exactly sure but wow this [ __ ] would get at least i mean as long as you're not like one of these bay area nor cal cloud people you know what i'm saying where you just got all the packs i feel like this would get anybody super high my final score on this i gave it a perfect 10 on the taste test it's not harsh presentation appeal potency wow flavor the color of the joint it was rolled really nicely it's smoking really evenly i wish there was terpene information so i gotta dock them on that i think this is gonna be a 90 this is going to be a 97.5 out of 100 overall i'm only docking them because they don't put the terpenes on here so i don't know how turpy the flower is which would definitely help dictate you know a little bit of the experience and so it's dizzy great [ __ ] work man this is arguably the best infused pre-roll i've ever had not seen out of the park the best product i've had in 2021 the best infused product i've had since i've been in the cannabis industry in five full years so great works dizzy let me know what you guys think in the comments in terms of what i recommend 10 out of 10 100 out of 100 absolutely make sure you guys go check it out available at stizzy downtown la i got this at the authentic 909 store in san bernardino show some love be sure to like follow and subscribe on youtube here on instagram as well and i will see you all on the next review man love you guys", "5K_DelfCJ8c": "hi it's paolo from glenny builditarian jewelry and i'm here together with matthew hi to announce that we are very excited that we have uh decided to enter the eco-friendly lab-grown diamond market and it's a space that matthew and i are very passionate about aren't we absolutely i think it's a massive uh opportunity we did find that some of the drillers debate whether to take it on board yeah and the common um the common theme is that re-salivate you or they're not real diamonds yeah right get your diamond test throughout their diamonds hundred percent hundred percent right with the resale value you know buying a diamond that ain't people don't buy a diamond for an investment unless it's a pink or a colored it's a motif people come in they want a beautiful stain and we're not saying it it has to be either and or just give clients the option yeah here's here's the same value in a mind and here's the same value in a in an eco-friendly diamond and just give them the option and you have the chance to not only capture a bigger market in millennials and potentially those who get married for a second time they don't have the dollars but you also get to be a better retailer to your customer because you're offering an alternative like 100 i mean i think the people who come out and say that it's um who say that no resolve i think that's just the excuse to be frank no frank yeah absolutely no one comes into your shop and says oh in two years time when we get divorced how much is this going to work no one says that it's all about the day making the partner happy all about them you know at the end of the day if they got 10k to spend and that you give them a mind say i can give you this or i can give you this in a lab grain the only difference is one's growing on that one's growing up in the mind right which and of course the lab grown is going to be a lot more value for money which one do you think they're going to take well being a millennial's food they're very they're very savvy in that regard they want value for money but it's not only that we haven't even talked about the whole eco-friendliness yeah the false factor there's no blood diamonds in them there's no carbon footprint that's as massive as when they when they mine the earth we haven't even spoken about that and they're all big components of why millennials purchase yeah absolutely that's a market that everyone is missing oh i can't get millennials in the door well give them something they want they're already coming in asking and there's been no ad campaigns at all on this nothing no you know when when mind diamonds did their huge campaign that's when it kicked off but now that mean these guys are coming and going i want to have a look at a logo and tell me about it and you've got retailers going oh we don't stock them because they're not real diamonds well that's rubbish you're doing your kind of disservice i'm 100 for you i mean look i've got a client his name is daniel he's from sierra leone right and he said to me there's a big mine there he used to work in that line and he said the destruction that this thing caused was huge it was big holes everywhere all the forests all the animals displaced and he said once they leave it's not like they replant what they've done it's gone it's just a big hole it's done it decimates the city that it's in and then they're starting from when they start before the diamond mine actually went in there and it said it's it's just disgusting what they've done to it look you know whether that's the angle you want to go with or not either way that's what people love about it yeah you know they love that eco-friendly you know we're going to try to develop boxes for these products with bamboo because it's eco-friendly you know and and that's what the millennials want you know there was an instance where we had three different age groups right of women so we had our generation thirties twenty-one managers and we all wanted different things so my generation wanted the big bling the big rock you know the 30s very similar but a little bit smaller the 20s totally opposite they wanted not to spend too much not to waste too much the really concerned about how it displaced the earth and all and all of the the pollution that was caused so they wanted something totally different but with the levees you can cater you know what i mean so if that's what they want you can give them that if that's what they want and all of a sudden people will come back to jury yes you know what i mean i love that spark so it's very exciting i love them i'm very very passionate about them i love them and i think you need to give them a crack absolutely absolutely why wouldn't you i agree you know especially if you've got people asking for them and the millennials love it it's it's the target market's there do you know it's one of those things where put a little in your window tell them the story about the lab growing how they've formed why they're great what the point of difference is that they are a diamond the price difference and let the and let the product have a go well i was at a shop and we were speaking about it and um she said we should know much about it hence why we're doing these sort of videos and i said to her for a carrot round oval um cushion and pair this spends ten grand four four carats ten carrying it's not that much of an investment if you really think about it especially in diamonds with a 40 profit yeah you know what i'm saying like why wouldn't you give it a go yeah you know and she she couldn't get a hand around it was so cheap and they're still diamonds and this is the point they are cheap they are diamonds comically they're 100 and they're eco friendly you know so we use the slow you know that be a friend to the earth buy a labrador well done matthew okay well i think we've given a good crack today we've kind of outlined where we sit on it and why we've entered the market you know we're very passionate about this and not only because of what we're spoken about but it gives the retailers a chance to earn a bit of profitability on their investment for a change especially in the diamond space now if you'd like to see what we're offering if you wanted to to bundle sale together or if you just wanted a further chat just give matthew and myself a call as you can see we're both very passionate about it and we're always up for a chat all right thank you guys bye", "Zd8GVSitS50": "[Music] one day [Music] want to live all right [Music] is [Music] [Music]

what's up guys simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "jwonp6UWouo": "so y'all

that you should be aware of like things like maybe we perhaps we should be preparing for what the government's getting ready to do you guys already see what they're doing the quarantine in us to our house on the virus that nobody knows nothing about and it's not only that the corona virus is an animal virus and I've even heard that viruses aren't airborne it can't be airborne I tried to look it

but that's all they showed I say Kenna Barros be airborne you can't ask no question about a [ __ ] virus unless they talking about corona virus the government's got [ __ ] locked down you also pay attention anyway I'm not a conspiracy theorist I'm just I like I like listening to facts to me the conspiracy theory is film saying as a corona virus without as shown without they've shown us anything they're saying oh five hundred thousand people are did where are they at where them dead people that they don't show you know dead people they don't show like a whole roll of people that died from the crowbars they won't show you that so the people ask me so how are these people died in them these people are dying from natural call people have died from the flu people are dying from old age people are dying from cancer sicknesses and everybody that dies from these things you know what they're doing they're saying that they have the corona virus they're saying that that's how they died so this guy over here dodge from cancer they say oh he had corona virus that's why he died this guy over here died from the common cold from the flu and they say oh he died from chronic virus we're not here for that you guys I'm sorry let's go I just want people to look at the information for themselves and decide for themselves don't listen everybody else just decide for yourself look at all the facts

though that burned pretty fast looks like we might get two bowls in this morning cause you know after I take this hit all of you be the flavor critique on it it is quite tasty you guys it definitely has a full flavor to it I don't taste any earthiness like I normally taste from other cannabis um it really tastes kind of fruity um but my taste buds are messed up too from smoking cigarettes all in years but yeah it tastes fruity to me so it has to be really potent for me to taste the way my tastebuds are set up I'm just playing oh yeah here we go flavor anyway on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best on the critique of the flavor of Mama's um I give it a I would have to give this up five but I made five I can't give it a high five I can't give it a low five I'll give it as a yeah I'll give it father it's quite tasty but I don't know but I am I I definitely have a buzz okay I just see myself when I lifted up my leg to get over my chair I just see me kicking my bone

hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is trippy Tuesday episode 54 today I'm reviewing a company called brass monkey for the first time this is a local company here in San Diego and if you're here in San Diego or even nearby you've probably seen or heard of these guys they sell a lot of cheap concentrates generally like 30 $40 grand trim runs this is there live resin which is a little bit harder to find definitely a legitimate live resin I had a chance to meet with them and find out that this live resident the gorilla glue is grown in house so it's always nice to find out that a concentrate is a single source when the company is growing and extracting everything in-house it's usually a better end result less cut corners and yeah this gorilla glue is no exception from brass monkey it's really good this stuff recently I picked up the award at the local farmers market which is like a cannabis farmers market we have here in San Diego picked up awards for highest potency and People's Choice so yeah this one is definitely one to keep an eye out for the gorilla glue my present from brass monkey yeah I haven't really tried too much of their stuff I had this flavor and I had one called Buddha candy which is also really really good yeah but a breast monkey awesome love the branding and this guerrilla food life resin is a treat for sure the smell on it is not the I wouldn't say the loudest gorilla glue and I think of really living like a woody kind of like chocolatey funky yeah just just basically almost like wood like I've said before like sandalwood kinda like wood chips chocolate kind of Punk like diesel funk this one is definitely more like a it's almost got more like an indica funk to it like like a blimey kind of I wanna see like gasps but it's a little bit more earthy compared to other gorillas glues I've had which I think are a little bit lighter without rambling anymore guys I'm gonna go in on my first bag here the gorilla glue live resin or brass monkey here in San Diego definitely keep an eye out for brass monkey concentrates this stuff Cheers [Music] that point of the flavours I I expect from gorilla blue mm-hmm but again just a little bit more earthy almost like a little bit more indica yeah you could probably see I am sweating a bucket right now it's because I'm right here on the coast here in San Diego and it is hot oh yeah mmm definitely some high THC levels on this grill ooh kind of an interesting consistency on it it's somewhere between like a sugar a nut and a honeycomb I want to say like it almost had kind of a yeah like a like a honey which is consistency a I feel like I don't really see any more but yeah like a honeycomb II kind of sugar definitely smelling really loud I haven't tried they're cheaper stuff this stuff I think the live resins from brass monkey are usually found for around 50 $60 retail and the cheaper stuffs usually like 3040 but I've probably cruised for this live or isn't if you can find it generally speaking I usually try not to buy under $40 a gram for concentrative just because you can get into some sketchy trimmer and territory that being said still really quality products all the way up and down the product line from brass monkey here first ad tour me back yeah usually when I'm chiefing on glue mmm I I don't really all right I do have get this very confused kind of effective it's not so much like confused in a negative way but it's definitely kind of a non-functional high for me I feel like I'm really high on gorilla glue not gonna be doing a whole lot of multitasking I mean it's definitely kind of in the category of like a head [ __ ] I would say yeah but that being said a really nice terpene profile on it it translates into a full melt really well as well as beachy I think it's just a really good genetic for concentrates in general okay yeah this brass monkey gorilla glue is really potent I would say definitely leans more towards the potency side versus just like a super trippy sauce or something this has got a heavy THC content and I'm not really feeling the slapped and the brain effective gorilla glue from this I'm almost kind of getting more of an indica effect off of it like I detected in the smell it's really just not the most woody kind of gorilla glue I think it's more of an indica cut or Fino yeah I'm really diggin it and it was definitely a really good first impression try a dank live present from brass monkey so yeah they're going on the second time here guys Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] earthy woody chocolatey mmm easily yeah glue clunk probably noticing a little bit of a change in setup here mm-hmm I stopped using my phone to report these videos so thank you hopefully from this point onward from now on I'll be using a DSLR mm with a rode video mic sorry for disappearing on you guys mmm doing this show week after week for I don't want to say no reward it's definitely been rewarding I've met a lot of awesome people and you know I mean the future is bright I'm really looking forward to it too reviewing a lot more concentrates absolutely but currently at this particular moment in time it's difficult for me to spend a lot of time on stuff like this if I'm not getting some kind of payment or money or something so I don't want to sell you guys [ __ ] you know I think I said that before like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna review like some subscription box or something like kill me before that that big comes just gets a little bit of to be a little bit of a drag week after week after week so yeah I'm gonna work on that again I really do want to be weekly with this show and there's really no excuse for me not to be so I think having an easier set up here this this setting this up to shoot this took me like half as much time so iron I think that will encourage me to to film a little bit more because yeah setting up in my room was a pain in the ass let me tell you but yeah this uh this press monkey chronically alive present is a serious treat if you can get your hands on it here in San Diego I mentioned previously in the review that they're live resins are a little bit harder to find they are generally in the 50 60 dollar price range not 80 which is really cool for a single source live arisen but yeah they're they're definitely known for their cheaper trim runs the they I think they even go all the way down to like 20 30 $40 you know grand it's just cheaper stuff but yeah it's nice that they also have a live present and they're still coming in at an affordable price and yeah slight business on point alright so yeah guys that that is gonna wrap up this review of the brass monkey gorilla glue live resin and organic live resin the one people's choice highest potency here at the cannabis farmers market I need to get out more to local events guys if you've gone to local events in San Diego I mean I just that I really haven't really gotten out as much but I'm gonna try and fix that hopefully it cools down a little bit because the thought of going and doing stuff outside right now it's just like no thanks it's a way to humid but um yeah guys sorry again it disappeared for so long I will definitely be filming more regularly and that's gonna wrap up this episode of trippy Tuesday it's been trippy Tuesday episode 54 reviewing at the brass monkey gorilla glue live resin hey guys I'll talk to you next week peace [Music]", "kyDnfHFKO70": "those dabs are no jokes that just ripped me oh my god hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is introducing this to the market is dabbing it dabbing we've got delta 8 dabs here color on that is really nice and light let's try a delta 8 dab and see how we feel pull out the last things we've got some goodies here these are both dope rolling trays like cool and kind of trippy and sort of like future get kind of westworld vibes from these got kind of like alien sort of angel robot it looks very cool on camera too with the light hitting it damn yeah i'm trying out the sixth final way to do delta eight which is dabbing it cheers everyone as alice the first to try this this new delta eight experience infusing it into these dabs that was a big dab too it tastes a lot like cbd very cbd taste but i do enjoy the taste of cbd so there you go that just ripped me oh my god cheers everyone yeah i am feeling nice and groovy right now between the vape and the edibles and the tincture and my arm is feeling all tingly we've also still got the moon rocks there i i love it shout out to hometown hero i really am a fan that dab is kind of like next level and if you want to see more delta 8 adventures from us right now all you have to do is hit this

it's just it's different you know and like always everybody we're using the regular select universal battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you

or something i'm i'm wired internet through a lan cable lately i don't know if you have this problem if some of you know the issue with the lan cable like it'll just keep spamming lan cable not connected and it'll just rapidly spam me i don't know how to fix it if someone wants to leave me a comment in this video um even if i do lag leave it i won't take it down usually some of my subscribers know that i'll take it down because i just lagged and it's like it's stupid video then it's just just cut off halfway through so i there's no sense of doing a part two i want to do a perfect run so yeah i don't know leave a comment if you have a suggestion on how to fix it i do like that 100 or 239.5 mbps download speed and upload speed being like i don't know 9.1 or something like that so [ __ ] dope all right we're going to change these high score streaks off because i'm not really getting a lot of them before i was sitting like war machine attack helicopter and like a harp but the attack helicopter and the harp they were like right around the end of matches and that's still progress you guys that is still progress all right i got this amazing class for you guys

what are we running here flak jacket task tactical mask because those two they go well with spycraft uh ninja i'm debating on i usually change between indian gung-ho uh scavenger and assassin yes yes it says all right what level are my friends on know my man over here on prestige what exactly 192 proceed five that doesn't make sense bro oh hell nah no he did something he did something yeah he did something remember you guys you can just keep clicking your xp tokens make sure that they're only xp and double xp they're not like you're not just spamming all of your xp tokens so like you see how i adjusted the top i mean like you know how they were separated for a second ago one said xp tokens the other said weapon xp tokens like right here and i'm not touching those because because as you see in the bottom right here where it says view tokens it says one hour and 29 minutes 31 seconds and counting um it means that if i click the weapon xp ones if i'm not mistaken it'll revert them and i'll lose that hour so what we're going to be running is we're going to be running some throwback mosh pit let's see if we have to activate 15 score streaks and you know what we're gonna we're gonna change

wax liquidiser Pineapple Express I'm gonna be putting I'm gonna be filling a half a gram cart and I picked out about quarter of wax to put in here that will be enough for this half gram so enough liquidizer to mix i don't know if that made any sense but all this wax is gonna go into this color right here and hopefully it'll be a good amount so the only thing I'm sticky appreciate it's pretty yeah some pretty fire wax this is exclusive in tracks a 3-1 so I have it in there is a shatter and I'm gonna put some I'm gonna put like half of this thing filled up so I'm gonna put just half in there so that's it filled up so I probably just want like uh I think that much I think this would be a good amount yeah so this field uh should be a good amount so I put all that in there and I'm pretty sure that's a good amount all right now I'm just mixing it just getting it in there I could put a little more I need to we're gonna see right now so I'm gonna put this close this and I'm gonna pop it into the microwave real quick and for it I'm up up 11 seconds just because of the microwave I have and yeah and see how see how it looks like after 11 seconds so that was a full 11 seconds and this is how it looks like I don't think it's fully melted in there yes I could just sale then just mix it y'all think it's ready yet I do have another way of making it though but I want to do it the microwave way because I think that seems best for the video so I'm just gonna put in the microwave for just well 5 10 more seconds I'll put 10 more seconds and then put it take it out and find and see how it looks like [Music] as a wax-coated be like melts it honestly looks about better it's pretty well melted I say so I think I should just mix it now mixing it the bottom of it's hot so I'm thinking this off it'll be ready it's got some little things I don't know if that's a wax that hasn't dissolved yet but out it's in there I'm gonna put it for the last two seconds real quick [Music] that will not do anything during a pretty good mix right now looks good couple things in there but I'll know what that is I just hope it's like a half a mile east all right so I think it should be good to fill it in a cart now looks like half a gram trust me it's about half a gram I just hope it's a little thick enough you know all right so here I have the cart pull the top off and just drip it in here so it looks like that was perfectly a [ __ ] half gram holy [ __ ] it's literally filled to like the very [ __ ] top it looks really [ __ ] good - honestly I kind of wish I could put the rest of this in there I don't want you so bad that's how good it looks oh she looks fire yeah it's filled to the [ __ ] it might drip out a little bit oh yeah so just use this little micro dropper and just suck that little sucker up damn dude this looks really gasps I'm not gonna [ __ ] lie oh dude look at that damn dude I don't know whether to sell it keep this one nothing so this was the ending result then here is how it looks like actually looks really good looks queer it's not super clear but it's pretty clear especially with the wax I use this is a really good shatter really pull and chatter - so now you could package these up to Sally or whatever and yeah or you can keep them to smoke alright got this house where this is what it looks like on the battery the dark the very dark part on the bottom is how the other stuff look like that's how dark it was but now with the new [ __ ] it looks way brighter and more good alright well thing guys for watching yeah you guys should get this [ __ ]

coyote infused sativa joint super dope product here that we have gmo root beer flour lemon bean resin total combined thc 80 no 837.5 milligrams or 33.5 thc no cbd and it says manufactured on september september 18th so super dope um they've got 93 herb 7 live resin it says it is infused with field extracts so looks like we're going to get something nice and delicious here i think i think ultimately i think ultimately this is going to be one of the best items that we're going to be reviewing number one i'm a sativa fan i have a little bit of experience trying their products so unless it's an ultimate fail which i doubt i think this is going to be something super delicious so one hit we're gonna talk about it two hits give you a score out of ten these are little infused joints oh yeah i gotta pinch it and slide they just showed me how to do this yeah there we go we took some pictures of this earlier so it's already open but it's got this nice little looks probably like a recyclable little container pouch thing here this little baby joint not too shabby let's smell it smells kind of spicy and earthy lots of flavor in the in the uh dry pool though wow definitely some good flavor

i'm getting a little bit of this lemon floral aftertaste but i'm not really getting much of this gmo i guess i'm getting mainly earthy and spiciness i'm not getting any kind of other flavors that i would like this you know those funky musks the garlics that awkward that awkward onion flavor that comes with the gmo i'm just not getting that and now we got a big rip on that one so yeah still i'm just primarily getting the the the live resin on it definitely roast the nostrils i can feel myself getting super head high right now and to be honest i love it when you're really thinking about a sativa you want this you want to mimic this effect of like caffeine but without the jitters but also this focus and you know if there's a body high that can make you feel all you know energized and

"HI20oQJKUmI": "most y'all know yeah mostly i know i'm so happy to be back we're going to watch uh sis nils and martial and i am a sad guy but today we gotta watch sis deals today and that's what we're gonna watch let's get it you see that honey it's a testament to endurance honda engineering rise to the challenge with the rugged performance of the redesigned honda ridgeline [Music] let's discuss the great game between the clippers and bucks sunday afternoon on abc the clippers were up 100 to four minutes ago so up four with four but they failed to score another point and ended up losing by five look richard we've been talking about this all season the point guard position they need a floor general out there but they are really capped in terms of what they can do at the trade deadline because they've given away all their picks so really it's buy out market what do you think they need to do with this spot what is that face for that base is like you know people get mad oh what about the clippers what about the clippers and then they they crit paul george gets a lot of heat i understand kawhi gets a pass but kawaii needs to start getting like talked into this a little bit because kawhi is a part of the problem as much as paul george even more so because kawhi is considered a better player point guard spot is more of the problem no i over nine for those two has nothing to do with the point guard spot like they've had a similar point guard situation over the last couple of years and they were so favored last year now we're trying to figure out why last year i think no i think the point and this is not a knock on beverly but to me your point guard either has to be a scorer or a playmaker he's neither you know he's a great one of the best on ball defenders we have in the league i think he would be even better suited at the two if that was available but he's not available but coming off the vents they need to but their hands are tied with the contracts to get you know these two superstars they got so you can look at a rubio or an eric bledsoe possibly packaging uh um who's the kid but they definitely i feel like they definitely need to address that point guard situation although the point guard is nothing to do with these guys going overnight i'm not making excuses for anyone and i don't think and look paul george has taken the heat in every moment this season he has been there for it so i am not i'm not giving those guys a pass yeah but i do think it matters who you have setting you up the play making it it matters and if you look at kyle lowry with kawhi in toronto it changed what was possible there yeah now kyle lowry i don't think is necessarily even going to be available from the rapture there's some question about that but the clippers don't have the assets but even if you look at last year in the bubble with what rondo did returning for lebron and taking the you know the burden off lebron where lebron wasn't the only playmaker on the floor like these two guys are you're scoring two and three and they have to be playmakers and point guards as well so like i said love patrick barely his tenacity his mindset his defensive presence but they definitely need to upgrade the point guard not a knock on path that he does different things my mom's always show up in the numbers too he's someone i would definitely go to war with but as a starting point guard on a team that's possibly a championship caliber team i think they need to upgrade the point guard you're not here for it you're just you know that face we're just we're we look at old for nine and then we say oh well they need a point guard this has been a conversation the whole season though all right let's move on because there you go thanks for watching espn on youtube for live streaming sports and premium content subscribe to espn plus the soap you shower with it's cause i'll let you in on a little industry secret most name brand bars and body washes i thought it was a six minute but no it's not you know what we might watch this neil tracy you like those uh indeed i didn't see it he's like yo look at the cars we'll put those up again you can check on your phone while you're watching here but do you think that the sixers now that now that they finally beat their nemesis the last two or three years how do you think they should do well they should feel inspired they should feel confident i mean they do arguably have the best starting five in the game they have the best big man i think right now that's the most dominant player in the game they have a closing jimmy butler they have a a guy that's a shot away from being the next lebron james and ben simmons and they have some shooting so they should feel inspired um they were down what 16 18 points last night against the celtics and made a comeback to win this game however in a seven game series i still don't think they could beat boston i think if marcus smart was in this game and played the defense on on jimmy butler at the end they don't win jimmy butler and in the fourth quarter last night too two questionable shots two three-pointers it could have been differently now he hit the game whether yeah to seal a deal but he had kyrie on him if does marcus smart never have gotten ejected from that game i think he made game-winning plays to sell a deal for the boston celtics well i like what brad stevens said he said he was disappointed mark is smart there's a difference when you see your your players fighting you think your players get a raw deal there there was nothing there for marcus smart to take himself out of the game that that's that would be important but do you think that was watching over flavor too right so video that right there you gotta go because that could lead to something else that could lead to suspensions for both teams because if he retaliates if all of a sudden something else goes on if this is what you're gonna do you gotta be out of the game fair so the cheap shot on the el the elbow with them retaliation you do something like that look a lot of what you guys do in these games it's a little not nip here or tuck there you are doing it in front of everybody you deserve to get thrown out i agree and be flopped on that plate he should have gotten yeah i mean he should have never gotten a flake or two on that on that push right there it wasn't warranted up that yes martha smart has to be smarter than that um because he's a vital part to their skills right so this gets back to what you were saying if marcus smart is still in the game if i mean the aaron banes thing that's the other thing i want to bring up so the air base thing the reason i posted that at the top that is no small thing i know aaron bates is not the first name we talk about with this deep celtics team but the on off numbers when he is playing versus not and the way they defend their crazy pants yes and so a grade two sprain is going to keep him out a while and then we get back to seating it was what just the other day that kyrie irving said ah we're good wherever we ended up seated i'm going to take a couple games off to rest for the playoffs we end up in that five spot i don't know aaron baines isn't there and they end up as a number five seat or maybe even lower like it's not yeah but so my thing is something oh yeah my thing is that celtics should not i love their confidence but they shouldn't feel that confident only because teams i feel like i've seen the kind of uh you know that there are spots in their armor that can be attacked and you can see that they're not as together as they should because ultimately if you're down in the series if you give up a home game you guys have to be locked in you can't be looking at other people who's you're going to be looking straight so for the celtics be like oh we're fine wherever we get in it's like nobody else thinks that you guys are just going to just cruise through but i think that they should feel confident about the 76ers and i think the 76 is part of the reason why they were so excited is they felt they got a monkey off their back right at the end of the day you were still down double digits baines went out which allowed indeed to go off and you lost your comp and and you know i just don't know like marcus margaret smart went out so there's a lot of things that went in your favor to help you win that game or whatever i don't know you're off the ship you're he jumped off the celtic [ __ ] he was on the celtics we're going to win the title [ __ ] he was out of the show i didn't say title i said that they would be the team in the east let me ask you a question just in terms of that little picking of players you say other teams see that yeah you were expert at this throughout your career what would you do if you were playing the celtics team in a playoff series to try to pick at what you see as some of the weaknesses or differences between them i would just talk a lot but not loud i just like yo man they keep icing you like like yo listen man you want to come over here i can't believe they talk about trading you listen i think you're a bad boy now i didn't look you're gonna have a great career i'm not gonna be here i'll be talking about you in the food but boy you guys are you just and this next time i was like marcus man like terry rose here terry man y'all was rolling last year man what's going on like i don't understand man like i know kyrie my god but jeez so you that's what i'm saying you do that little every little body you just keep whispering things into their ear at the free throw line like yo man what's going on i think you should be like i can't believe they started going hayward over man come on man well [Music] right so those are the things that you can do it doesn't have to be loud and boisterous is if you plant seeds like either in the regular season or in game one game two looks like games those seeds start to sprout right right they start those down start to sprout you don't have to be loud you don't have to troll on the internet there are little things that you can do that can kind of poison the team and in the playoffs yeah all things are fair and the ref can't say anything about that there's no cheap shots there's no physical physical uh acting involved it's just chirping it's church i think the celtics are vulnerable i also think they're dangerous so we'll have to see which way you", "1_UrdqAfGYg": "most you know boo bear is back and today blue bear is back with some reaction nails you know

to the beginning of melissa's long journey to liberate herself from the guilt and shame of her family's legacy a long search for answers about a father who wasn't at all what he appeared to be these were really good memories for me being out here in the country i could smell the alfalfa still i could hear the birds and hear the animal sounds the horse just like i did when i was a child it makes me miss being a kid hers was a scrappy upbringing in toppenish washington a rural and rugged community where the welcome sign celebrates where the west still lives the memories of riding my bike and my dad would kind of run behind me as i would be peddling down the street here makes me miss having it dad these home videos depict an adoring dad here he is riding an atv with his bundle of joy on board and showing off his daughter's shine i got my sister [Music] but behind the loving facade was a violent killer a secret that would only be revealed years later melissa is the oldest of three children and always looked forward to when her dad a long-haul truck driver would return from a trip first thing i do is uh when he got out of the car run up to him and go for his pockets for the change that he had left over from his day i got to keep the change and i would save it up to violence like that is she looking through rose-colored glasses or were there really good times there really were good times rose hawk is melissa's mom at christmas time even if we didn't have the money somehow he figured out how to get the money and bring back what the kids really wanted for christmas would you describe him as a good husband no he was not a good husband why he was very distant with me was he abusive to you no he was not if he was angry he would walk away my dad would never spank me or

traumatic event melissa witnessed as a six-year-old that she still remembers vividly one day when i went down here to go play with my brother my sister house i found some little kittens they were resting right here when i got out here my dad was working out by the barn i said can i see him i said no he grabbed him by the tail and hung them on the clothesline and wailing screaming their little kitten screams i ran inside the house to get my mom and i wanted it to stop and then by the time we got back out and got out here they were the kittens were laying on the ground over here so i remember bending down and seeing that they were dead the way he just looked at me was i don't care you this is so funny to watch you grimace and and and be tortured he liked it i first met melissa in 2010. what is it that you think you caught a glimpse of that day the sociopath the the part where he felt in control over me and that he enjoyed it i i got a sense that there was another side to him so it's almost like you caught a glimpse of the monster who killed these people i did i didn't catch a glimpse aside he certainly didn't reveal to rose when she fell in love with him as a teenager he was a very charismatic considerate young man and i had no clue that this is what he would become rose says that after a decade of marriage strange women started calling the house and she began suspecting he was having affairs i said who is this and she goes oh i'm he's girlfriend i said well i'm his wife click she had had enough and after 14 years of marriage the pair decided to separate

still loved her dad she said your father doesn't want us anymore and we're separating and i thought this is not the case dad loves us once he sees me again he'll change his mind although the family never reconciled over the next five years melissa's father would visit whenever his trucking jobs took him their way we'd come into town and take us out to eat go shopping and then after the shopping he would take us to the grocery store he'd stay the night and leave the next morning melissa except for those awkward conversations that might make any teenager cringe wherever there was a female around he had to say something that was inappropriate he would start talking about his sexual acts with other women and i didn't want to hear it it was disgusting to me you knew it was wrong he was proud of his sexual experiences and wanted to share it then a conversation at a diner that would haunt her for years to come the last time i saw my dad he came to spokane just a sporadic visit and we came to a diner like this he said has something to tell you but i tell you you'll you'll tell the authorities you'll tell the police and then my stomach started to get upset he can say all day long

gave me a bible it was just something from him that kindness even extending outside the classroom taking elizabeth to church on sundays with his wife did you ever think anything of their interactions together it was like a father-daughter relationship but the way i saw it too is the way he would explain it in fact i called her our third daughter sometime elizabeth's family attorney thinks cummins recognized she was a vulnerable target he was specifically grooming this child for a very specific purpose and that was a relationship he chose a girl that was clearly having issues because she went to him for quote-unquote counseling she was the perfect victim the two began communicating on instagram cummins posting you're all my heart ever talks about it was love at first sight at last sight

i'm trying to see how deep this layer is and the shovel's still going down what's up guys my name is chris from vogue's prospecting if you're new to the channel a big one welcome andrew an old moldy hat like this one welcome back today i've got the whole crew out on this gravel bar because it is the richest gravel bar i have worked in the last four years this is what a one shovel test pan looks like from this spot that is insanely good one of these pans can take about two and a half shovels so we brought out a special system to work it let me show you that we have dubbed this the mcmatting system after its inventor mr mick the leprechaun mick took a video i did earlier which i'll link up here on youtube where i simply shovel gravel out of the pay zone and into fast water and at the end of the day i gabby pumped up where i was throwing the gravel and i got really good decent results but everyone said why don't you put some rubber matting in there and i'm just literally throwing gravel onto this section here and when i fill it up i push the rocks down the sluice the overburden and a little bit of gold get caught in that but most of our gold should be in there at the end of today so let's get this big matting system working you think there'd be a gap but it's just [Applause] not so so when i put my shovel in to push the gravel off i'm not actually scraping the mat with the tip of the shovel i'm just putting it in maybe an inch or so on top of the dirt that's in there and pushing the overburden down that helps stratify everything and it's really only getting rid of the light stuff i want to leave everything heavy that's on the bottom of the mat in place [Applause] the leprechaun's already on it [Applause] [Applause] so [Applause] so the thing about this system is you don't even need this loose at the front all you'd have to do is be a little bit more careful about how you remove that overburden so you can get sluicing literally for like 15 bucks worth of matting and it works really really well i mean i'm going to prove that at the end of the day when you see the goal but for now just know it works really well i've seen my first pieces of leprechaun candy check it out oh yeah boy we know there's going to be more in this mat too dietary fiber [Applause] so the soil changed consistencies as i got deeper i just wanted to take a test pen to see what kind of gold was hanging around out on this soil change and by the looks of it some okay freaking bits yeah we didn't get as many as the top pan but we got some nicer sized flakes and a heap of micro stuff so this layer is going to be interesting to explore [Applause] so [Applause] so i've discovered the deeper you go the smaller the bits get so we're going to stick to the top two layers hopefully there'll be candy there big rocks oh come on i got ya it's time to do some ruger gold on the front of that thing about this setup right now is that it's not actually perfect realistically i need to be in the fast water like over there except it doesn't quite work because it's too deep and on an angle when you get this mounting system in the fast water with the front edge turned up basically it creates a trough and all of your lights blow off and itself stratifies i'm having to manually stratify and remove the big rocks at the moment which is a little bit slower but still how easy is this is there any rainbow treasure a couple of times tiny rainbow treasure the rest of it must be on your v-manny ah it's in the snuffer bottle yeah well that's okay this is the stuff that was in the mats that i don't recommend working properly i am giving my lower back a rest and having a look in the solution i have seen some okay pieces in these top cells so we've got a couple of little bits in the letters here but if you watch these two cells here you'll see flashes of gold they look like decent sized bits and all of that is our super concentrate senor gadzi is struggling with his um one whole sluice he had to i don't know what oh man the story of this loose just that thing if it gives you any gold it's done well found it down the hole get a bushfire layer you can tell because usually it's a lot of silt and clay filled with charcoal and i'm just going to take a test fan of it so this is the stuff it's a little bit sporadic with the ash but basically what you'll end up seeing is this really fine grain sand charcoal charred rocks all embedded in what is basically a weird sort of stretchy clay the reason bushfire layers are so rich is because when the fire goes through it removes all the root systems there's nothing holding the soil left and you get a lot of erosion so usually end up with a decent amount of gold [Applause] so we'll soon know if this bushfire layer is holding any gold we really hope it is see a little bit in the corner yeah that's not a bad test pan look at that be 20 good specs in there all those people giving kids who played in the mud a hard time who's laughing now a whole lot of play i've run about 50 60 shovels worth of dirt and now we're going to clean out i just pushed the vast majority of the dirt down through this loose so we're going to see a good clean out in the sluice but i want to see what's hiding on the matting we've got gold in the lettering we've got gold in pretty much all the cells up the top and we've got a lot of iron stone i think this might be a real tasty looking cleanup this is going to be pretty good this is going pretty good for a 60 shovel run [Applause] stupid yellow rocks oh the anticipation at this point look at it all coming out through that gravel yeah that's that's a respectable little take that's just out of the river sloughs [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] way too much a little bit you can see the bit get off go on my bed so that was not the easiest thing to wash out i'll be the first to admit hopefully that awkwardness is going to pay off in gold leprechaun booty [Applause] well it certainly caught all the very fine gold look at that and that mat is not 100 clean yet that's what we got out of this loose and this is what we got out of the v mat so most of the chunky gold was caught in the sloughs most of the fine gold was caught in the v-map and i was pushing it all through at the end i was scraping the mat unlike at the start but as usual we are on a tight time schedule because there is a massive thunderstorm coming our way so we have to get out of here because this creek floods hard and i do not want to become a boat right before we lay out the gold i want to know if you're serious about safety pick up your own switch safety squint t-shirt today the link is in the description below this is all the gold we collected with the mcmanning system next to a clash guitars pick and let me tell you once i got that mat home and scrubbed it i found a lot of fine gold but it's time to get this on the scales i am pretty sure that even scarface would be happy with that line or booger sugar so we're gonna weigh it up i'm thinking it's close to or over a gram let's go for the pessimistic viewpoint nine five one oh we are climbing oh can we do it [Music] 1.032 that is a stonking amount of gold 1.032 grams of gold is worth 74.70 australian at the time of recording which is a pretty good take for just a couple of hours work i only shoveled in and around 60 shovels worth of dirt and then i almost got hit by lightning in the thunderstorm on the way out the point is a little bit of research and leg work there are still really good deposits of gold out there you just have to go sniff them out that has brought us to the end of the show i hope you did enjoy my short little gold prospecting film and until next time please give your dog a scratch behind the ears for me your cat a scratch underneath its chin and your goldfish a little tickle on its tail peace and i'm out", "7BDgxnxo2aM": "sorry about that chat all right i was just trying to check something

"5_lDOEYRVzU": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps back again with another cartridge review and we're doing the friendly farms exterbzilla collab sunset sherbet stream yeah before we've done let's see the alien labs and gelato 41 on the friendly farms car we have done another service of the one the oreo cream one and we've done a humble's finest one with i think that's the straw nana cartridge yeah we've done that one as well so yeah on to our next adventure here with our friendly farms brand spree um honestly guys i'm really liking the cured resin carts this this is my first brand i've ever had resin carts with and i've just been thoroughly impressed so this one is eighty four point ninety one percent thc with six oh six percent cbd that's beautiful ninety two percent total cannabinoids on this one that's really nice oh beautiful honey honey like color there as well yeah i've been really enjoying the cured resin cards as you guys know and here we go i'm really excited to try this one out guys so pack yourself a bowl dab get your pen ready all that stuff cause i'm gonna jump in with a hit right now and i'd like you to take one with me so cheers oh man yeah this this is another really good one um i'm a little a little disappointed a tiny tiny tiny bit just because this tastes just like the oreo cream one now this may be because this is the same um you know brand sharpzilla the same collab with the friendly farms as the oreo cream one was so that could play into maybe why they kind of taste similar maybe similar extraction processes they had the same terpenes type thing whatsoever but um yeah i was expecting sunset sherbert to be a little bit more um a little sweeter you know a little bit sweeter this is still sweet but um like i said in my oreo cream review it there's a lot of like a heavy doughy taste to it and this one gets that too but at least this has a little bit of a deeper terpene taste to it than the oreo cream one did so now we're going to take another hit and see how it goes see if we taste anything different cheers [Music] oh there is a slight little sour tang at the end there i like that i like that a lot kind of like the regular sense that sherbet so yeah you know these cured resin cartridges really capture the taste of good flour and i really appreciate that you know that's something i really miss when i switched over to going to concentrates and and you know just dabbing or using constant cartridges mostly just the taste you know most of the cartridges don't really get the same exact taste of the plant and it's just nice to be able to know that there are cartridges that are out there that can do that so yeah and as per tradition we got the hamilton ps1 right here ready to go and we're going to take a little bubbler hit of our cartridge the sunset sherbet cured resin cartridge i don't know if this is the best cured resin cartridge now um we're gonna have to see we're gonna have to do some more heavy comparisons between this and the other ones i still have some of the other ones thankfully just a little bit left but still got some of them so we'll have a few comparisons of those in a bit but yeah once again this is the friendly forms extra zilla original sunset sherbet cured resin cartridge 92 total cannabinoids 84 thc 6 cbd this thing is very tasty and very very potent so yeah guys please if you are willing to join me pack yourself a bowl a dab get your cart pen ready all that good stuff and cheers okay now let's go on to the bubbler it's got a different flavor than the oreo cream i'll take back what i said earlier um maybe it's still very similar but there is a different flavor like i said earlier there is a slight little tank sweetness at the end but now i'm getting a very very very small amount of tininess and citrus no no suggesting it just pine it's just a little sweet kind of puffiness which is nice so yeah i'm really enjoying this one and maybe in the cartridge comparison i'll have more better and maybe in the cartridge comparison i'll have more developed thoughts on the flavor profile of this thing you know maybe i'm still missing some things out etc etc thanks guys for watching and yeah peace out actually hold on fakie out let's take another hit before we go all right cheers relax that should be it for now um you know thanks guys for watching and if you enjoyed please leave a like comment subscribe notification bell hit it please and uh yeah p2 out peace you", "OAeayndHR_I": "so serious let's go I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this or before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information yo what's up guys you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "BRSwbw7Zzmo": "hi I'm Harry and I'm Brenda I'm Joseph oh he's going to love blueberries in a short period of time we could see the blueberries yeah and we're going to try them on my phone so are you ready good look go okay okay that is it focuses and move it back away from the camera 38.7 t6 solid okay if the sound you made with", "6mjzh54x7Y0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram hybrid joint from lime so lime reached out to me they wanted to get my opinion on their products i said sure set me up with a credit at a shop nearby uh they didn't really do that they actually had a rep drop off uh some stuff for me at a shop um so that's what this is so just a heads up this i don't think it's cherry picked exactly it is sealed so it looks like it came out of distro but i just want to be upfront that this isn't something that came off of a shop shelf it was provided by lime themselves um so any case yeah i'm curious about them though um i want to see what's going on i'm always curious about what's in joints and whatnot and the difference is today they actually included a little like a flyer i guess a little marketing thing here that kind of says what they're about so it's lime preroll zero trim zero shake lime pre rolls are packed with 100 california flower only never shake and then looking on this it's like they've got whole nugs on here which i haven't really seen in any pre-roll outside of in el blento so i'm curious if that's what's going to match up in here and i was also like is this the same joint that i have looking on here it's like probably because it looks like they might have changed up the packaging slightly but i believe this is the same j so in any case let's go ahead and pop this thing open and see what's in here see what lime is about they wanted to give me their little spiel which i will reach out to them and get but you know i mean i don't do that with other prerolls i don't necessarily get like the pitch or any of the marketing info before i open them and look at them so i figured it'd be just fair to open it up and check it out you know and we're gonna find out together what's good in here what i'm finding out now is this plastic it's pretty tough all right cool we'll move that and the lid just jumps right off and there we go that's what's inside this is just a regular flower one no infusion oh i didn't even go over the tube itself and i got so caught up in all this marketing stuff here so here's the information we're all curious about before i get in there lime hybrid pre-roll ignite inhale and enjoy uh there's the batch information thc coming out to 19.71 percent source broadway alliance and a little bit of a cbd in there and uh that's about it manufactured packaged on 924 so not too old a little over a month at this point but relatively fresh government warning there hybrid 100 california lime and it's shining so it's a little out of focus but yeah i think that's all the information there all right follow the vibes that let me lime all right so there we go all right so let's get into this j and see what's up in here another one of these veins here as i saw on the last j interesting i don't know what's going on there somebody mentioned in the comments that it could just be uh something to go that it's like the seal of the raw cone i guess but yeah i really haven't seen that let's go ahead i don't even know if this is actually a raw but it looks like it let's do a crutch check it looks a little weak not the weakest though still standing on its own feels decent not crazy tight at the top so that's all right um but yeah let's cut this open i don't expect we're gonna see nugs in here if we do that's gonna be pretty crazy i don't even know how you roll a j like that but uh no shake no trim according to this little square here so let's cut this open and see what's inside because i have a feeling that this i mean that it's not a bunch of nuts you know i mean that's just my feeling but all right here we go let me go ahead and drop this out of here real quick and there we go and i'm seeing some i've got a little material jumped out at me there but i am seeing some passengers already quite a big offender here actually right out the top i don't know how he survived the packing process because that seems fairly significant but yeah we've got a few other ones in here looks like basically these sugar leaf stems and whatnot a lot smaller ones but this one was just like he jumped out thing right at the top i didn't get a dry pool on that but let me go ahead and get a sniff on this material but there's a good amount of sugar leaf in here let me see smells decent i mean it smells like outdoor to me that's what i would say this is for sure um i mean lime can chime in and let us know but i'm really just getting kind of a planty smell off of it it's yeah it's not really anything distinct maybe a little bit of mint but not too heavy so that's pretty much it um not looking horrible not looking awesome definitely not looking like this promotion um so yeah i mean i'm gonna say this thing definitely was not cherry picked for me so that is what's in there so yeah not not awesome not i don't like to see this especially though that is huge and it looks like there's maybe a couple other guys here that i can i mean it doesn't take me much time to find them so that's we're getting there but all right let's check the weight here but uh yeah not too stoked on this so far and let's see now the caveat about the skill is always that it could be off by a point so if this comes up to point nine or higher then we're okay so let me go ahead and get it teared out over here get you guys over to the scale when i collect some of this all right there we go zero this out there boom cool so yeah so if we come to 0.9 or higher then we're good there but i'm just not too stoked on this material you know uh it's not atypical to see something like this in a pre-roll but it's not something that i would i mean i would make a little poster about it talking about how we only use awesome nugs and then show a picture of that like that's what's going to be in there but there we go it comes up to a gram so it's probably at 1.1 there is a little bit that i didn't even manage to get in there because it kind of exploded onto my counter when i opened it up but it's like you know the material weighs out so yeah uh you know i don't know i don't know how i feel about it it's not the greatest i wish i knew the ticket off the top of my head i would say if this is sub 10 bucks then it's par for the course but not something i'd be stoked about so that's what's in there and now you know", "y5pW3XIVfjc": "all right I got these brass knuckles cartridges brass knuckle cartridges this one's a girl ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max 3.7 if you're going bolts you know for the lowest and then for your highest on Watts it's e if I'm not mistaken it's on the Box use a Chico so I

subscriber video got 103 subscribers now but it's my first chance i got to get out there and go prospect today we're going to go to lydle creek it's about half hour from here and yeah see if we get some good gold stick around for the giveaway here's the exit sierra coming south from uh hesperia never been to this place so it's gonna be something new for both of us all right here we are a little creek flat oh creek whatever you want to call it area problem is we don't see any water anywhere so we're going to keep going up and see if we okay well we found water but most of the picnic areas and parking parking areas are closed they're like fenced off and most of the water that all the water that we've seen is within this uh city area just like there and i don't know how to get in there i know how to get into the city area but not to the public areas we drove around the residential areas and there's water there but i'm not gonna park in a residential area and go gold prospecting keep you guys updated we're here i think there's more cars parked here so if it's illegal they're gonna have to stop all of us now we're gonna go check out different spots see how close the water is keep you guys updated this water here is kind of deep be good to come uh swim here when it gets hot but like always trash i'm not really seeing anything good or worth digging yet but i'm going to keep looking a good spot so it's loose you know what do a couple test pans right here in this area all right working on my first pan here and this water is freezing my feet are numb it's like 75 or maybe 70 degrees out but it's still early it's about 8 o'clock in the morning but this water is freezing i'll let you know this first pan goes nothing in this first pan there's a little bit of black sands in there not even fly poop okay well that's good i didn't set up my sluice box yet so two pens later and we got one tiny piece in there one tiny piece of shiny but that was only this pan that i'm using here that's all i tested with so i'm gonna set up the sluice box uh here somewhere and run this dirt here and show you guys what i come up with here is my sluice box setup and yes i do have a sluice box i just rarely use it because on the type of places i prospect there's no need for one or there's no place to put one i had to shorten it up a little bit but hopefully it works okay i'm gonna start processing some dirt now and show you guys what i come up with clean up number one this is about four of these buckets here i don't know it's not looking too promising i don't see anything in the v-matting but we'll see well that's a goose egg at that spot this garnets and tiny little fly poop that's not what i'm after today okay so what i'm doing here is i'm panning down to the black sands and taking the rocks out of course it's hard to do with one hand but i'm doing that and then i'm reloading it with our with our dirt here we gave up on the sluice box that was defective it's not working it's a piece of junk i tested it with a couple tiny pieces of gold we found and they went right through so yeah we're not using that no more but this is last of it and we know there's gold in there we already found some and hopefully there's much more in here and i'll show you guys the outcome all right this is the last of it and i already seen a couple of nice little flakes in there i'll take it a little bit further a little bit more i hate going through black sands but it's fun when you get surprises at the end all right as far as i'm gonna go now let's tap it back i have my assistant trevor's toys and games here helping me helping me record so i can pan and not miss anything i don't know if you guys do this but once i get to a certain point like this i get rid of these uh black sands there and i can see gold already yep i see it peeking through some nice pieces there all right all right our work paid off i mean it's not a huge amount let's see oh some good chunky pieces there well little creek lotto creek whatever you're called you did not fail me the first five buckets this loose box we just got tiny tiny little pieces it wasn't worth it retained spots i'm not going to tell you i'll show you guys where but we did a couple pans and we started getting pieces like this so we took a couple buckets from it and this is what we got that would suck if i dropped the gold in the river all right that looks pretty that is beautiful all right well we got a little problem i didn't bring my snuffer bottle so i'm gonna have to carry this gold we got water bottles water bottles and there's pretty chunky pieces so i just put in my water bottle and then we're gonna combine that with my gold and my snuffer bottle and i'm gonna weigh it up and then you guys know what you're getting for the giveaway all right this is enough of little creek beautiful beautiful area i recommend you guys come here and dabber jay out all right there's my helper my stepson and also fellow youtuber trevor toys and games did you have fun today fine find any gold yeah tiny pieces yeah but these are dams they're everywhere i counted about 20 so far we walked all around this uh river here or it's creek whatever you want to call it these dams are everywhere but this is nice very nice area we've only ran into one person so far the only negative is trash there's freaking trash everywhere like we make it a habit to pick up at least one piece of another person's trash i mean if everybody did that like the people that are doing the right things like everybody watching my videos but we all just took one piece of trash when we go prospecting or whatever i think these areas will be a lot cleaner like this area in little creek or lada creek whatever you want to call it there's a lot of swimming spots too if you want to bring the kids i haven't seen many snakes or any snakes at all no bear poop or nothing like that but yeah nice area looks kind of smoky i don't know if there's a fire or something all right so we're gonna all right i'm gonna show you guys that exactly how i got here and where i parked and everything let us pack up and we'll head out rivers here to the left trails right here cars up there that's what the mountain looks like that we parked next to i say it's about a quarter mile maybe half mile hike down to the spot we're at you got to do a lot of walking around and find a good spot to dig a lot of test pinning all right we made it here's what it looks like there's like three different uh creeks we passed this first one i went to the middle and that's like the main one okay so we're back in asperia uh where i live and we're gonna go look for my gold i got about i think it was about a gram of gold from uh gold bay the uh yeah padre that i bought and i got some from i got some gold from um what's it called cajon creek so i'm gonna combine that with what i got today and i don't know what i'm gonna do i don't have a scale so i might go to a pawn shop or something and see if they can weigh it out for me and i'll see you guys there all right well i'm kind of ghetto and i still don't have a new scale so i came to this pawn shop and yeah let's see what they say we buy gold so hopefully they'll be able to tell me how much my gold weighs see you guys in there all right so i put the gold in this bag here i can't go back there with him to film it so i'll see you guys in a bit [Music] okay 1.8 grams 1.8 grams for this it's pretty good okay so we got 1.8 grams of gold here pretty good pretty pretty good look at it look at it okay well that was an adventure so i just looked up uh the gold prices it's about 68 uh 69 dollars per gram and i have 1.8 grams so that's about 112 dollars for this i should be more prepared for this gold here a little bit of black sands in it not much so this is about 112 dollars and it's going to go to one of you guys so all you got to do is watch the video like it share it take a screenshot show me that you shared it and comment i love gold by the way i'm giving you guys 24 hours to comment uh on this video to get this free gold so yeah good luck to the winner you get 112 dollars well actually you

buddy's cartridges that i have not tried before this is cherry pie and uh i had a choice between gelato frosted zin squirt or cherry pie and cherry pie had the highest terpene profile so i figured you know since i haven't tried it let's do this video i also picked up another buddy's wax as well but that will be for a separate video because i feel like it's pretty special so first off let's show the cherry pie no i'm saying and we got the buddies so i'm excited to try this in its own video itself but yeah you know i had to pick up today so when this says d and s it means diamonds and sauce and if it says these is diamond s sauce you know i'm saying so that's how to read that so let's get started oh by the way this is 32 out the door uh not bad and as you can see the turret profile you could pause if i'm going too fast guys but as you can see it says 11 percent and the the most prominent terpene is carophyllene which i it shows like the fruits that it's found in so i think it's grapes so very nice cherry pie oh that so let's just open this so we got a total cannabinoid of 77.59 with the thc being at 75.19 so about 2.4 extra cannabinoids whether it be it's not cbd because there's zero of that so it could be you know cbg cbn all that stuff doesn't say though but you know what i'm saying got the stuff on the side and batch id as well all that good stuff so for those of you who don't know buddies are ceramic coils you know what i'm saying but the downside of buddies is although it is cheap and high quality it does not last as long as your other cartridges you know compared to a nug so we're gonna be using the totron in today's video shout out to you guys oh by the way i'm actually outside habit right now because after this video i'm gonna get hungry about to order some food so you do see cars i am in the parking lot right now so i just thought i'd let you know but so before someone [ __ ] says some [ __ ] well they're going to say some [ __ ] anyway you know what i'm saying but bam here it is it's all all it's glory very nice oil very amberish but very nice let's get a thumbnail maybe like this hopefully it's getting it adjust it and put my face in the middle or something something so like i said we're going to be trying it off the towtron and let me know if you've tried the stream before and let's see if i can actually find my what's in here i was like did i just lose the magnetic adapter for this video like how the [ __ ] am i supposed to do this video so got everything off let's just screw on this shouldn't be too hard there you go let's drop that bad boy in all right cheers boys it's a very earthy taste don't taste grapes like the the terpene profile says but cheers again oh kind of tastes like that um that moxie art kind of like vegetable like weed type but very refreshing in itself but very similar to other cartridges i've tried it's a very earthy very vegetable taste but this one has like a slight sweetness towards the end which is pretty enjoyable but nonetheless not as good as other buddies cartridges that i've tried but not bad not bad and at the end of the day 32 for this you know it's on the lower end of a gram cartridge price so fairly uh fairly good for that price so cheers i'm gonna take another hit and uh let's just see if it tastes different i guess i don't know cheers like i said not bad and this was manufactured uh september 23rd of 2020 so it's still pretty fresh it's about two months old whoa that's quite the hitter very interested to see what this looks like and how this tastes but uh yeah you can see the terpene profile is not that big on this one so i don't know but nonetheless a very good cartridge from buddies not the best that i've tried probably on the lower end of the buddies cartridges that i like but still enjoyable nonetheless i will be taking one more hit for the end of this video and hopefully you guys enjoyed it you know what i'm saying and let me know if you've tried this what your opinion is on it it's very uh floral not floral but like vegetable [ __ ] earthy type of taste with the sweetness towards the end but cheers oh that's a shame the battery just died [ __ ] all right well you already know my opinion of it that's i mean [ __ ] i have no charger either but hopefully you enjoyed the video nonetheless just another buddies cartridge video i know i've been doing them a lot but it's only because i like it and i've been spending my own money on it a lot of people are just like you're always doing buddies or buddies but it's like dude if i like the product and it's affordable you're gonna see me buying it you're gonna see repeat on repeat on repeat and it only it speaks volumes about the product itself you know why would i continuously spend money on this you know what i'm saying like it's not something that i receive for free i've to this day got nothing from buddies and i'm okay with that because it's not about that it's about pushing good products that i myself would enjoy and spreading the information to you guys you know what i'm saying and whatever it may look like to you you know i'm pushing buddies a lot or whatever just know that i'm spending my own money so like yeah that's all i got to say other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out guys [Music] we always [Music] i can always", "yIYQBORTaF4": "food try now throwing guys

gold market as you can see the 1750 level has offered resistance but it's not really 1750 that's a problem it's the yields in america that continue to spike that's like um kryptonite really for gold and as a result it's not a huge surprise to see that gold has pulled back 1700 ish area continues to be important and therefore i think we need to continue to look at the level as a significant gateway and here's the thing if we break down below this lows that opens up a move down to 1500 on the other hand if we break 1800 then 1850 could be a target this is all about yields follow the

BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made

video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "G1T5oNov6cc": "hey guys it's Danny and today I'm going to show you how to make a classic omelet now omelets are great because they come together so quickly you can make so many different flavor combos and they're great for breakfast lunch or dinner so it's definitely a technique that I think every healthy home cook should have in their back pocket so let me show you how to do this so the first thing that you want to do is grab an 8-inch nonstick skillet this is what I refer to as the Anka pan I think every cleaners delicious kitchen needs an 8-inch nonstick skillet that's pretty much dedicated just to eggs so I'm going to get that heated over a medium-low heat the key to cooking any type of egg is to keep it low and slow that's how you keep the eggs nice and tender and custardy and so that they don't get too well-done now you do need to put a light coating of butter or oil or coconut oil in the bottom of the pan and what you don't want to do is use an aerosol spray can on your nonstick pans because they're not going to get the life that you want to get out of your pan aka it's gonna ruin the finish a lot faster so if you want longevity out of a melon stick pan make sure that you do not use aerosol sprays so for me I'm just gonna get a little bit of coconut oil in the bottom of the pan and then you just want to swirl that around or you can use a paper towel or a brush just to get a nice light coating on the bottom of the pan then I have two eggs in my bowl here I'm just gonna whisk those together and then we're gonna pour that right in to the pan and as soon as they get in the pan is when I like to season them so I do a little bit of salt a little bit of black pepper and then with a rubber spatula I just gently start to pull the ends in and move the eggs around a bit so that all of the loose wet eggs can move around the pan and get underneath and set up and we still have a nice base for our omelet basically you're just not letting anybody get too comfortable in one spot you want to keep them moving because in an ideal world these eggs will not brown right they'll keep a nice tender yellow color and a custardy consistency okay once you can't move it around anymore you just let it sit you want to make sure there's no holes in the base of your eggs but move around anything that's super loose on top now classically this is gonna finish cooking out of the pan that eggs are going to come to the perfect temperature consistency once they're exited out of the pan but if you know that you like your eggs a little extra well-done then what you can do at this point is just pop a lid on for a minute or two because that's gonna help to steam the top of the eggs the thing is if you leave it too long you're gonna run the risk of browning the bottom of the pan so you just have to side what works for you okay now I'm gonna add my filling at this point I'm just doing a couple tablespoons of shredded cheese but whatever filling you are using this is when you would add it to one half of the omelette and then we are gonna fold the omelet on to itself perfecto now ideally I'm taking this out of the pan now and it finishes cooking on my plate and voila and come on over to the island and I'm going to show you it once you cut it now if you want to add a little bit of fresh color and fresh flavor you could do a little fresh herb right over the top of your omelette and then cut and enjoy and I really want to show you guys the texture of the inside of your omelette see the cheese is melty and you can see you got your melted cheese and the egg has set and cooked perfectly mmm I just left the it's custardy it is exactly the way I like my omelets cooked and I'm telling you if you want that egg cooked to custardy perfection you're gonna get it out of the pan right before you think the eggs are done cooking because they finish cooking on the plate so if that my friends is how you make a classic omelet it could not be any easier and I would love to know if you want to see some omelet flavors come on down in the comments below and let me know and I'll be sure to follow up with the video like that in the very near future and if you and already do me a favor and take a moment to like subscribe and share this video with anybody else you know who wants to make healthy eating easy thank you so much for watching I'm Danny's fees and I will see you back here next time with some more clean and deliciousness Cheers [Music] you [Music]", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some

batter review I picked this up from my local vape shop I can't save it all vape shops across the country will have it but I will definitely have these [ __ ] description or links in the description down below for you guys to check out so let me tell you a little bit about the background in this first this is just my nicotine right now by the way so when I moved to Colorado I was already [ __ ] vaping I wanted something to where I could just switch out tanks real quick and on the device I had and rip it real quick put it away and be high and just switch back to my nicotine and roll on about my [ __ ] not there were no products that existed like that I mean there are prefilled hash cartridges but those were easy to [ __ ] tell some of the the prefilled oils those those are very expensive you know that you can fill your own cartridges with and they won't always work with these due to how it's made and it's just I was just very disappointed in the vape game for THC so I was at the vapor shop about a week ago and they're like yo shatter batter is the [ __ ] Jam and I will tell me about it so what this stuff is is it comes with a little measuring dropper plunger I guess this isn't technically called the plunger it comes with a three milliliter plunger and the markings are on there so you know exactly how much you're using you take three milliliters of your shatter batter and then you'll put it into an oil slick then you will take a gram 1 gram of whatever concentrates you know full melt concentrates you know shatter wax [ __ ] rez or live resin rosin whatever and mix it together and then you put it in the microwave it says on the bottle for 12 to 15 seconds now obviously microwaves are all different elevation blah blah blah blah so you know start off at 12 and keep a close eye on it you definitely don't want it to start bubbling you just want it to liquefy real good if you know take it out it says take it out stir vigorously once it is completely melted there are no bits of shatter whatever kind of concentrate that you put in there it's 100% liquid you can go ahead and add it to a regular vape tank and as you can plainly tell there ain't much [ __ ] difference between this and this I mean look at it you wouldn't like you yeah nobody would everything twice about it [Music] so now I told you how to use it now I'm gonna show you how to use it I got my nicotine on my smart pro color 225 big shoutouts to smart I'm actually using my smock my pro color box to stand the to stand the shatter batter up so you guys can see it love smart big shots of smart so I'm gonna go ahead and take off my tank of nicotine and I'm gonna put my THC onto the onto my pro color 225 and it looks virtually identical just like that I highly recommend using the same like if you already have a mod a tank mod I highly recommend just go ahead and use buying a you know an identical tank maybe just a different color so you know you just make it easier for you to you know on court buying coils and all that [ __ ] so that's just a recommendation you know but I bought this tank this is a an ass fire what is it uh kool-aid oxo and it sucks man it's a good it's a it's a quality [ __ ] quality [ __ ] tank shoutouts to ask buyer yeah I just uh they recommended this at the vape shop for no leakage purposes so before you rip it you want to make sure your you know your settings are adjusted properly and I recommend this is a little bit thicker than most vape juice so I definitely recommend dry ripping it a couple of times when I say dry ripping and I mean not firing it when you rip your device so I'm gonna wait for this light to go off what you just did I'm just gonna [Music] that's just a guarantee suck some of the liquid up and it gets on the cotton that the coils are wrapped around so you're not burning straight cotton because you don't want that [ __ ] all right so I've got that I've got it primed so I'm gonna rip it [Music] [Music] so as you can plainly see if [ __ ] rips and one thing I was concerned about is the potency like a lot of dab pens out there the prefilled cartridges they're not like they're not as potent as it would be to taking a dab um that was that was what I was really after you know something that I could not have to not have to you know like a concentrate burner I have to keep putting wax or shatter on the thing and sweat you know and I'm saying like with this with this right here you just have your [ __ ] concentrates in the tank and when you're ready you just [ __ ] pop the [ __ ] on there and you're ready to go there's no packing it or whatever whatever you're just ready to go all you gotta do is just prime my [ __ ] a little bit and then you're good to go happy smoking [ __ ] in this case happy vaping [ __ ] [Music] [ __ ] dope [ __ ] 30 milliliters enough to do 10 grams [ __ ] awesome [ __ ] right here definitely recommend so those are all the pros oh well what they guess this is um it's about as potent is however like the percentage about as potent as the percentage of the concentrates that you put in there maybe about it's probably you probably lose about maybe 20% potency maybe maybe you know because obviously it's diluted a little bit you know by the [ __ ] and I'm chatter batter but it's so I mean like it's still [ __ ] well worth it and it rips [ __ ] hard and you will be you will notice a [ __ ] difference you will notice it noticeable head changed after one rip I get a [ __ ] to you the cons there's really only one and this is labeled as pink lemonade smells like it tastes like it with a you know I do like that which I don't recommend anybody doing i vape a lot you know this is 0 milligrams nicotine but I still don't recommend anybody [ __ ] consuming this but it smelled like it it tastes like it but once I mixed it in with the concentrates it was blue caddy wax once I mixed it in the [ __ ] dude I mean there's that gram of [ __ ] wax compared to the 3 milliliters of that it was just way overpowering and it [ __ ] smells like dude this totally smells like wax it's I mean the look is look as covert as covert is [ __ ] but the smell not so much there they have other varieties again you can find their links down in the description you can go check them out they've got non-flavored which I haven't tried but people say preserves the tert profile I was going for something you know more stealthy like as far as aroma but this is the herb was just the wax which is way too overpowering but for vaping on the go is it for [ __ ] vaping on the go just a quick tank switch and then you're back to your [ __ ] nicotine a new atomizer and we're back to our nicotine and if nobody smelled it nobody's any the wiser so definitely [ __ ] check it out definitely [ __ ] worth we're scooping up if you're trying to [ __ ] get your [ __ ] on the go real quick and not have to fumble with a lot of [ __ ] it's [ __ ] dope yeah definite thumbs up I should boy daddy dank nugs I hope you guys enjoyed the [ __ ] review let me know what you think in the comments down below like share and subscribe and as always happy smoking [ __ ]", "ABVgu-LaSwg": "expiration date package date uh we also got the thc content seventy point nine percent two percent cbd and seven point nine two terpenes this is the cartridge super tasty and the potency is there for sure if you guys haven't tried this brand though um i really recommend it it's very good compared to raw gardens plug play stizzy this is the one for sure you guys like strong strains um this one is perfect honestly the flavor is there it actually has flavor compared to like stizzy live resin tastes like wax this actually has flavor has the taste of the slurry cane in it and the potency is there as well um it's nothing compared compared to this i've tried so many brands none of them raw garden plug play stizzy buddies west coast cure left coast i've tried almost every brand at this point and this one has never disappointed me super good the airflow is there i think the ceramic coil just makes it ten times better odyssey just hits different compared to the cartridges that raw garden come in every brand needs to go ceramic honestly this is the way to go if you guys haven't tried them it's a must it's a must trust me go cup", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "89dT-kfEC6Q": "it's another epic unboxing however it's another Perth Mint epic unboxing a double whammy hey everyone its Joe and Michael from bullion now bullion now comte you selling you the best bullion bars and coins ship to you worldwide from a little out of Melbourne Australia all right cool woohoo yeah you've got some vim and vigor in you right austere babies alright so this is a box of Perth Mint stuff I don't know what's in it you do know what's in it I do but don't tell me we'll just figure it out as we go along and unfortunately we did start off the video and we did have the blue plastic seals you know the blue straps they were on the box and as soon as you cut them with your lovely blue stanley knife what happened there was the phone rang so fine it was you are fired so that's why it is sans blue straps but let's still sealed still sealed yes with the with the tape and there is a surprise in the bottom well somewhere if it's in the bottom yet okay cool something you have probably never seen before oh cool all right so a lot of this what you're giving away here is a lot of this is probably going to be more your generic stuff but then there might be a there is a surprise all right cool look it's good to just you know open purse mean boxes and look at all the golden and goodies and it's all gold right yes this is all gone okay yep alright and this is good for people who obviously you've never seen maybe haven't seen pertinent all the range of kirtaniyah products from the Perth Mint how many times can I say the word Perth me into didn't video and we are sponsored by we are not we are not being just so we're clear this is not a sponsored post there is not a sponsored phone we are not paid by the Perth Mint to you know we just buy their stuff okay that will be the surprise I open at the end okay cool all right and I've always really liked the way the Perth Mint package their stuff they do a great job yeah which station because they've posted a lot of numismatic stuff as well which you need protective so good stuff that you don't want the numismatic stuff yeah that awful numismatic stuff which is just completely we will educate less it is weightless is completely and utterly pointless oh yeah let me have it I yes Planet of the Apes sorry limited edition that people trade amongst the press has no value you're digging your own hole there buddy boy what we refer we were earlier today we were trying to make a Bitcoin versus gold debate video and Joe had to pull the pin I'll realize we have would have dug himself in or Halloween do you mean win the phone ring that's what you mean this is for people that haven't seen these are city cards so these are Perth meet city cards yeah so they look suspiciously like that and this is how they come when you order a full box it's obviously full of you know all the one type we've ordered a couple of half boxes here so they're coming here and they're presented like that so this is a good way if you're stacking gold actually we get a lot of people saying you know it's really awkward with bars and yeah they fall off and things like that if you order a full tray of these they stack really nicely in your safe or wherever you planning on stacking your gold you got products so just as an advert if you like each other that the Saudi card packaging correct so these are a mixture of they would be five green bars okay cool all right let's get a nice little sunlight there and the Sun there we go nice Perth Mint beautiful this is the black packaging they changed it a few years ago now it used to be the green packaging so if you're ever buying this is actually a good little thing right so if you ever go to a bullion dealer and say can I have I want a brand new person me into five grand bar please they bring out a green one you immediately know it's not brand new correct yep cool it might be very likely pre circulated yeah unless they've had it sitting in the store for three or four years which which is not an issue so you know Garland's gold that's right but just just for you know just in case you know you really want brand-new for whatever that reason just know they come in the black packaging Lucy why do they package them why do they package it because why can the Saudi card why not just buy bar just a normal bar why not just have that woods well answer the question for me I'm staying behind the camera okay so the reason they store them in CD cards is a security reason so you can see on the back here it lists amongst other things its way to purity but it also has a code on it so that code is individual to this case and you can actually contact Perth Mint and say I've got X code can you verify it and they will actually verify it right so you can see there there's the patting on the back of the bar is part of their security program because it the way it presents so it stops forgeries that type of thing the other thing you can check is the fact that it is it's solid sorry it's been sealed he's what I was trying to say then so no one's tampered with it no one's scraped the bar no one's done any damage to it you can tell as soon as one of these has been opened easy so you can see if it's been tampered with correct yeah the other thing that we also see sometimes is and this one's not going to do yep so they've actually got a plastic film over the xxx card itself yes and I can't grab this one there it goes there you go so sometimes you see these as bubbled up and things like kind of doggy you'd like I have there yeah that doesn't mean they're not brand new it just means that this protective car the particular coating sorry starting to lift correct and you'll actually have some people here that work here yep that as soon as I see that they rip them off that would be correct that would be like me no not now not when we're buying them brand new it so for example if I bought a whole bunch of these back from a customer and maybe they've had them for a couple of years if they're all a little bit bubbly and so yeah as in dog-eared you just rip it right off because it's just like a you know you buy a brand new phone and you take it out of the box and Scott that all those little plastic layers on it you just pull that stuff off so it doesn't affect the resale value or anything is just even Perth Mint want to take so much care they don't even want to scratch the outside of the packet yeah so that's completely fine yep got the other advantage of these city cards these ones in particular and we showed this on a previous video which Joe might lead to is that we can actually XRF them so to test their purity and we don't have to touch the packaging at all it's non-destructive so it means that we can actually check that this bar is four nines through the soda card so it still stays sealed and we can still say yes this is definitely four nines perth mint and XR f is x i f is x x-ray testing x-ray testing yes x-ray fluorescence testing correct excellent we'll put a link above to that yeah so you can watch that video it's actually been really popular that video so we've got some 5 ounce bars 5 grand getting tied this round grabber Grammy up we've got some I'm assuming those attends 10 gram bars pop in so they just look like slightly bigger brothers yep you can see all right there that is 10 grams yep in the other box mainly because I ordered them in Pikeville yep cut away from yourself cut away okay served a customer and we're about to open this one we were so there wasn't any ounce bars in that one yep and in this one more they're chunky yeah so they are hundred grammars I like those they are awesome now I have seen do I want one sorry do I want one come on Christmas bonus much okay look look how chunky that bar is that's pretty cool 100 grandma yep yeah there's great awesome that's your hundred gram and skip hundred grandma and then there's oh one gram is from the salon I don't think I have a macro on my my yeah what did they call it on my phone there we go one gram cool I'm very small and then we have yes I Goodall Duan er that the bread-and-butter ravine distress exactly right there is you one ounce 10 or over there we go lovely good old one ounce we sell these by the by the truckload excellent what else when this is the surprise very cool indeed trying to use the jiffy bag is on the in to give it a go see what happens the stuff that looks like a specialist but it's not it does always wonder when open if I nicked the bag and it all comes flying out yeah this is the gold version of the silver version that should have been here today but wasn't delivered today so it will be somewhere on route what what was that there was a whole mouthful of words I said this is the gold version yeah of the silver version AHA that he's still in deliverance okay we deliver so your way on the silver delivery but in the meantime the gold version came in so this is called a super pit what's this this is a new release from Perth Mint all right let's try and get in tonight so if you can turn that around a little bit just there we go so this is this it's to recognize the super pit in Kalgoorlie all right I thought super pit was gonna be like some kind of car racing thing not there you go so these are released in very limited numbers how limit are we talking very limited I can't remember the exact mintage I'll look it up and we can put it on there on the thing I think it's I think it's one answers really 50,000 silver so 10,000 gold and 59 so maybe it's a car that hasn't could be that much gold literally no I did count plate I'll look it up and we'll put the exact mintage numbers somewhere attached to I can print it over there sure but as per usual these sorts of things they were all sent overseas except for a very limited number got into Australia and we're talking in the tens limited to Australia all right off the gold and the silver I think they limited to 2,000 oh and so if you want some of those we do have a delivery coming up okay there was only 2,000 kept in Australia and we have the silver of the silver yep and we have 500 of them turning up in Nice so if you want some get in early because they will disappear much like the double dragons did yeah along that sort of line they're very limited mean how many did we get of the gold of the gold at the moment I ordered just the one really that was all that let me have is it pre-sold are these fun no it's not actually really it's not okay so I have one yep like I doubt it's very doubtful whether I can get any more but if this one goes I will try but games all that the wholesalers would look cool just hold on a minute cause I need to buy some gold so no you know me I'm all silver but that could be very good for someone to snap up one only then we know we have we have okay very cool just popper over just turn it over just to see the mesh her magic on the back the new effigy the recent effigy cool very nice indeed and we'll hopefully show you the blue the silver ones within the next aisle sir fantastic so is that it folds box that's it for the box well it's another epic unboxing here at bullion now of course like subscribe all that stuff you want to get your hands on that one gold ounce the only one you

how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results thanks for watching we hope that you found that was helpful for more tips and tricks make sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel and follow us on social media at Goa peer pressure thanks again for watching [Music]", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "kIJwz4q0xJg": "alright Eddie here going to show you the basic demonstration of the 1 pound closed-loop system by seven-tenths knob extractors on the right we have our tain reservoir which is full of our cold liquid butane we are connected to the liquid line to the top of our material column we have checked all the seals and everything is nice and tight on our closed loop I'm going to start off with a this is just a five-gallon bucket cut in half got some dry ice down in here we're going to start off by doing is everything is our chain is closed off our line is connected we need to open all of our valves on our system let me go ahead and move our system into a nice little blank our dry ice and just into there you kind of want to twist and turn that guy and get it down there as so so now we've got our shatter platters pretty much down in the dry ice use our bucket of crushed dry ice over here to fill up around that let's see what's there off the top as you can just not going to hurt it okay so now we have our lower reservoir completely or most of the way submerged in tracks to cool the lower portion and take your vacuum pump pick up your vacuum line to the lower connect right here and what we're going to do now and at this point you never while you're vacuuming you are never going to introduce any butane liquid or gas into your system at all what is this second now nice and tight okay and reopen this up now again everything is open so we're going to vacuum lower chamber and our material column leave this open so we definitely want to vac out this line all the way up to this valve and this is going to stay closed until we start our operation so our next phase right now is to come over here and start up your vacuum pump and go ahead and let that guy do its thing and we have our gauge here on the back which will allow us to see where our vacuum is at so we're gonna go ahead and pull that to a full 30 start beating over here is probably about 20 degrees here's something I do recommend a little tip while waiting for the back to go down I've got a nice little racing stripe a black square black painted on here so I can tell say there you got 14 degrees 15 max out 15.7 so we've got some pretty good cold tame down here and what the matte black does allows your temperature gun to get a accurate reading off of the side of a chamber this guy seems like it's getting pretty close so he needs me to see we are almost all the way down to that full 30 so we're going to go ahead and just double check tighten up all the connections very quick make sure there's nothing lose it all these don't need to be over tight if your your seal starts to squish out too much you tighten it too far now we hear our vacuum pump is no longer drawing any air sounds like it's in a full vacuum let's go ahead and give that a little check we can see we are now at a angles kind of throwing it off a full 30 vacuum there that's what you're gonna do now come over here turn your vacuum line off over here put your back in point turn your pump off me now remove your vacuum line from your closed-loop assembly that sound you hear is dry ice rattling against the stainless steel as it melts sorry let that sit there for a little bit we're at a full 30 vacuum go ahead and close off your top feed your butane all right next step in the process is you want to make sure your back needle does not move for a couple of minutes long as you know I have previously pressure and vacuum tested my system before we came on to this demo video so I know mine is good to go but I like to pressure test up to about 110 psi hundred twenty psi let my system set for a couple of hours make sure we're not any pressure differential and do the same with a vacuum make sure all your seals are good everything is good to go and then you're good green to go on rain running your system so we're going to go ahead and start our closed-loop system so the first thing you're going to do is come over here open your liquid butane yeah okay and then go ahead and track over the top of your material chamber you'll notice you start to hear the butane running and now all your butane is going to want to collect down in your lower chamber because you've put it on dry ice so now we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and let this go drain through into our system so nifty tool I brought in here is a refrigerant scale we can now know exactly how much liquid is still left in our cannister so when we know all of our sullivan has flowed into our material column now we started with a very cold solvent that's going to result in a slower flow of your butane through your material that is all preference you can do your own research on colder solvents versus warmer solvents and results everything like that I personally run with cold solvent and in this case it is butane now something you can do to speed up your process is elevate your sullivan tank what that will do is ease the it'll actually just basically you're using gravity at that point to help assist your flow and quick check here and see how our solvents flowing down you'll notice the dry ice creates a space around the stainless steel that's from the warming lambda you want to get rid of that so yep there we go we are working away and draining into our column see if I can take in there so your flowing down into our column now go ahead and let that finish up got about half a pound left of liquid butane in our reservoir here let that finish up and as it warms up to room temperature it does increase in pressure so we're about 15 minutes into our demo here we're about thirty five degrees on our solvent tank now on the outside should actually give you more accurate laying out the black on this 10 about 33 degrees as that finishes up let me go ahead and set this somewhere where we can monitor Kai let's go along I'm going to go ahead and break up my ISO here so when we're done all right oops thanks oh I hadn't see right here root of whopping 20 psi let's do two uh poll we've created our lower chamber soul of our gasses have turned back into a liquid and they are Rican dancing in our lower chamber here see a little gap we like to close it up keep it colder go ahead and say we have here got about 2.2 pounds left of butane gas yeah something I like to do to combat that here's a good old bucket some nice warm water just simply let your tank press the gases from the hot area to the colder area so you're pressing out of your canister and you're moving up through your material column and pressing and condensing back down into your dry ice color our dry ice surrounded collection chamber dries nice and surrounding there so give that about a minute or two let that tank warm up nice and good temperature to it now something I will mention in this video it's completely optional I don't do it all the time I do it sometimes using alcohol or ethanol or any sort of other Sullivant to help supercool your dry ice now I know people do that I do use ethanol um for getting my dries colder colder so now we're about point one pound off on this tank being empty over here go ahead and close that off you know this can simply be achieved without a scale I like to use one it's a nice tool to have around it's not we've done is we have you've closed off our butane tank over here we're going to close off the top of our closed-loop system up here so we've closed this valve now and what we're going to do is now that everything is closed we're going to disconnect the recovery line which is going to be from your butane vessel there will be its ninety bits of gas maybe a tiny bit of liquid left inside of your recovery vessel that's okay and in this case I'm actually removing it from both sides which is completely unnecessary to do now we're going to go ahead and past recovery line to our lower chamber down nothing huh now the next step is you're going to need to create a vacuum on your butane vessel so I'm going to go ahead and just take this outside real quick and bleed out any extra gases that could still be inside of here because you don't want to do that inside I'll be right back all right so that was a type of psi in there a little bit of pressure of leftover residual gas very small amount just like to do that outside and keep the work environment nice and safe so we're going to do now we're going to attach our recovery line here to our vapor connection the vapor connection is usually read on 30-pound tanks and almost always blue on 50-pound takes I personally suggest just read what's on the nob the colors do change and you don't want to just rely on color rely on what the company has printed on the valve and that's you know the most obvious and safe way to go about this you can recover into your liquid port you can liquid recover into your mate report again that is controversial you can make your own decision for yourself whatever works better for you what we're going to do now is we've hooked up our vacuum line which is attach our vacuum pump to in my case the liquid line over here go ahead and open that up there's no pressure left I've drained this tank completely safety checked it make sure there's no gas residual left and we're going to open up our vapor line as well so now what we can do is we can create a full suction a full vacuum on this tank and this line up until this valve and this is where all of our sullivan and oils are sitting right now so let's go ahead and back up this chamber and as that is depleting any air oxygen any other gases inside of that table morning bring over my here yup every good this has number dry ice and a little bit of leftover ethanol from all of my rooms and go ahead and set this time here's how to get it cool now this fall you see this from a little bit of methanol distill down the body I'm going to keep everything flowing we're going to go ahead most writers can use as you can okay set that down nice and carefully right here now we're going to let this back here thunk she'll pull back over here we're going on yep all right so it sounds like our backing pump here is pretty much maxed out there go ahead and close off part with the toy over here so now we've removed we closed and removed our vacuum line so now we have a vacuum from our butane cylinder all packed up with dry ice and ready to go this is open here and go ahead and do and I'll show you real quick flashlights you can see well nice and full of liquid oil and butane down there so we're going to go ahead and recover all this out now and the way you want to do that let's go ahead just open up this valve and that's going to allow the gas to escape into the chamber a little bit of ethanol bubbling over there help stop in a second the next step what we're going to do pour some hot water for warm water say about 90 degrees for a bucket we're at about zero psi right now maybe one or two I'm going to go ahead and do this a little bit pressure more this one to start recovering a bit quicker with the warm water that's going to warm your liquid turn into a gas gas can evaporate recollect in your cooling chamber off to the left and you'll be left with in your right collection chamber in the shatter platter is your final product now this recovery process is all based off of how cold your recovery chamber is and how warm your bath is you never want to over warm your bath and cook your oil you never want to never really want to you know go over about a hundred and ten degrees I'd say would be the absolute maximum you should ever have your water going on your collection platform so just going to let that go ahead and recover away over there keep back and kind of watch it now something you notice me do from time to time is uh come over here and we just kind of mash down a little dry ice and again I had ethanol in here to begin with so I realize who's gonna be okay make this video a little bit quicker yes let's give her recovery pressure over here have Pete we're still over here recovering about five psi so you see if I can move this LED light there you go definitely boiling off down inside of there your residual oils will end up on the bottom of your collection plate on the bottom of your chamber when this is all gone so you just want to go ahead and monitor this until you have an extremely low pressure left in your collection vessel and there's about no butane about when your pressure reading when you close the recovery valve which is this valve right here should read no more than five or 10 psi we'll show you how to go ahead and open up your vessel go ahead and let that do its thing in so weird rash now for this project I did use a about 22 pounds of dry ice kind of overkill that I just would like to I like to have plenty of dry ice for my recovery makes life easy and see my water all right so normally here and your supercooled pot has cooled down your warm water so if you replace that one water with new warm water all right so what will happen my LED lights I'm using my phone light here forgive me people so we are coming down to a last bit of liquid butane in there it sucks oh well my depo cooler is leaking a little bit which sucks so forgive me yeah sorry guys I'm just not into wasting expensive solvents yeah okay so what I just did is I close this valve here we are done recovering so what I can do is I come up here turn off my collection reservoir okay it's going to be a slight amount of pressure possibly a little bit of liquid left in here so just a timeout there is some time oh cool okay so now we have as we basically have our closed loop system is now done processing all of our material is now in the bottom our collection vessel so going to do is you wanna give a nice little towel I think you don't really care about you're going to wipe dump in dry it off and get all the water off of that guy and we are at 2 psi so we can go ahead and open this there's actually a vacuum in here we've actually recovered to the point where we had a vacuum so now what's actually plausible and safe to do you can go ahead and your inch I'm just going to throw my am I now this was a very good run this was nothing like a smoking hole and some above that we notice I have the valve open to make sure we go to accumulate so it doesn't have any tendency to want to come apart on a pressure dry off your chambered all this water vapor all the bullets off of here before you go ahead and die pick up your chamber and then you can go ahead and remove the top of your chamber take your o-ring off like this episode back over here on my towel so it's nice and protected hang a little o-ring up for a second and here you have your this is a food-grade obviously just a little demo run this is where all your oils will end up have this is not very good material this was just just to do a demo for you guys with this will probably get used for some edibles or further broken down further processed these guys hope hope that answers some questions", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "U1gKO4QKi_0": "Finally we built a\nmachine to kill Godzilla. In the year 1992,\nin order to save Japan.. ..from Godzilla's attack,\nthe Counter-G Center.. ..gathered around its best scientist.. ..and built a war machine. The machine was called 'Garuda'. But its strength was limited. We needed a stronger machine. By using high-end technology.. ..they invented a unique robot. That robot was successful\nin stopping Godzilla to an extent. But couldn't kill it. After that, the Counter-G unit.. ..hired the best scientists\nfrom our the world. And built a machine, which was.. ..the same size as Godzilla,\nwhich was.. ..capable of fighting against it. And it was called 'Mahabali'. The nuclear will be\nchecked in 30 minutes. Its engine is driven by one man. Heavy hydrogen helium\n3 are used for this process. His hands are made from\nalloy, which we call MP1. And the outer layer. It's made from synthetic diamond.. ..which is invulnerable to heat. It reverses heat. Amazing. I am sure this machine\ncan kill Godzilla. Oh no.. Hi, let me introduce you. This is Ms. Julie. - Hello. I am Robert George. Is this a robot? - Yes. This is the best in modern technology. It's called 'Garuda'. 'Garuda's been rendered\nabsolutely useless. This is not that. Mr. Robert is a part\nof the team that built this. And he.. So which section are you from? Computer section. Oh, computer section. Pleased. Let's go inside. - Why inside? You're being sent out. - What? Here you go. Mr. Robert George,\nreport to G-Force immediately. G-Force? Alone. Bachelor. Hobby: Teranadones. Yes, sir.\nDo you know what Teranadones are? Flying dinosaurs. Shut up. You've been transferred here so that.. ..you can join the training program.. ..with the other two pilots,\nfor the 2nd robot. But now I'm having second thoughts. I think they've made\na mistake about you. Flying dinosaurs. Do you know what you're here for? You can put up dinosaur\npictures in your bedroom. This is a training centre, get it? Speak up! - Yes, sir. Come in. Tony, reporting for duty, sir. Take him along for training. When Godzilla attacks.. ..the safe zone is\nin 43 degrees horizontal.. ..and 81 degrees vertical direction. The fire rays from his mouth.. ..reaches its target in 1.6 seconds. Start. Start training the\nnew trainees of G-Force. Be ready to fire the laser\nat the ammunitions barrel. Ok. Fire. Lift the aircraft up, increase power. Is there a problem? No problem, sir. Idiot, the engine on\nthe right isn't functioning. What is wrong? The fuel-line is damaged, sir. Quickly, start the emergency systems.\n- Okay, sir. We've been here before. With the geological\nteam of a petroleum company. I see. Back then we saw a strange thing. Let me show you. Professor, is this really\nthe remains of a Teranodon. Yes, there's no doubt about that. There's an egg too few yards away. Take us there. Strange, I can't believe it. Teranodon eggs. Seems like it's still intact. Let's see whether it's alive or not. Professor,\nhow old do you think the shell is? Saluja, come here. Take a look at this. It's a piece of that plant.\n- Can it be useful to us? Professor. Look at the egg. Look! What is that thing? Teranadon? Teranadon? It's a giant bird. You think that's his egg.\n- No, I am completely sure. That's why it's so big. It's grown so big\ndue to radioactivity. Nuclear waste is dumped\non this island, do you know that? Godzilla! Run towards the helicopter. Professor Humai discovered.. ..a giant Teranodon\negg during his expedition. The egg's been kept at Kubuto's.. ..National Institute of\nBio-techniques, for further tests. We're all eager to know.. ..whether there's\nlife in this egg or not. Wonderful!     Wonderful! Who are you? Hello. Who am I? Sorry. Don't you know who you are? - No. Well, I collect\ninformation on giant birds. Hey, stop. You can't come inside at this hour. Yes, I'll stay out. This is very big. You can't stay here. When will the egg hatch? I was wondering how\nthe baby's going to be. Wow, what's this? Don't touch that. - Okay. Hello. Yes. I'll be right there. Okay, professor. Now please get out. Please take me to your professor.\n- Impossible. Okay. Alright. If you don't mind,\ncan I say something? What? I'm going to haunt\nyou in your dreams tonight. If you don't leave,\nI'll call security. Listen to me. Listen. Keep a 24 hour watch on that egg. Take a picture every hour. Then we'll know why\nit's changing color. I don't know how it\nended up in my pocket. Maybe you put it there. So that we can meet again. Will you stop your nonsense or not? I know you stole it. Bring that piece\nof plant back right now. What could it be? Saluja, would you like\nto hear my theory about this egg? Go ahead. The color of this egg reflects\nthe emotions of the baby. When we lifted the egg\nfrom the island, it turned red. Because it was scared. Whenever it's scared or restless,\nit turns red. I see. Saluja, I was checking\nyour time of duty. That's when I realized,\nwhenever you're on duty.. ..the egg stays normal. And in your absence, it becomes upset. What could that mean? It can hear our voice. He feels safe. And he feels safe around you. He thinks your voice\nis the voice of his mother. So for him, you're his mother. What is this? It's a piece of plant.    Yes, I can feel it. Hello, Misha. Hi How are you? - I am fine. How are you? Are you all okay? - We're fine. Hello. What brought you here today Hello, professor. I came here to see you. Who is he? Robert George, G-Force. G-Force! I've heard that all G-Force\npersonnel's are useless. Brother, he needs your help. Regarding this. We can hear some strange\nand faint sounds from it. But we can't figure out what it is. Maybe they can find out something. Music from the plant? - Yes, sir. Listen to this. The children heard\nit through concentration. And I recorded it through a computer. Yes. Is it true? It wasn't a giant bird egg,\nit's something else. This is a Godzillasuar. - What's that? It belongs to the Godzilla family. But it doesn't look dangerous. Are you sure? Yes, it doesn't look dangerous. It looks innocent. I am certain now\nthat it's not Gozialla.. ..instead, it's Gozillasaur. That means...that was a parasitic egg. What? Professor, what are parasite eggs? There are some birds.. ..that lay their eggs\nin a different bird's next. He suffered the same fate. What happened? Godzilla. Run! Run! Help! Help! Run! Yes. What? Gozilla's attacking the city. Emergency! Godzilla's attacked the city. All personals are\nrequested to take position. Red alert! Control section, okay! - Okay. Godzilla is visible. Godzilla is coming closer. Prepare 'Mahabali' for takeoff. Where's Robert? - I don't know. You don't know. Where is that fool? Control, arrange for a spare pilot. Transport shuttle will\nreach the cockpit in 15 seconds. Godzilla's at point Q-back 108. Get ready to fire 60 rounds\nwith paralyzing needles. Okay, transfer to T-2 block. Roger. Air system on. Remove ground air. Missile systems are okay. Laser beams are fine too. Weapon section, ready. Lift up 'Mahabali'. Switch on the lift. Start countdown. Instructions; stand-by. Okay. Head, open. Open the body arms. Elevate Mechagodzilla. Open those body arms. Start main-engine. Starting main-engine. Mahabali, take off. Maintain angle 120...keep\ngoing straight. - Okay. Saving course, 230. Run! Run! Help! Help! Help! Help! We've spotted Godzilla. Prepare for landing. - Roger. Activating main-screen. Pilot, keep the helicopter ready. Project Exodus is about to start.    It's time to test the\nstrength of modern technology. Start the aerial attack. Launching mega buster. Attack with lasers. Switching plasma energy on. Open the plasma port. Firing plasma grenade. Fire! See, 'Mahabali' is stronger. The heat rays Godzilla fired on him.. ..were reversed on him. Fire paralyzing missiles. Fire! Fire the shock tankers. - Okay. Electricity discharge. What happened? Power discharge is rebounding\nat us through the cables. The engine room's on fire. Keep firing. We can't move. Don't spare her. She cannot fight in this condition. For now, her survival is a big thing. Godzilla has.. Central control room\nto location Mahabali. Things didn't go as we had planned. Now it will take us\nmonths to fix Mahabali. Dammit. How do we stop it now? We've no clue. Did you find out where it's going? He's heading towards Jurassic city,\nnear Kyoto. We've to stop it at any cost. Target in sight Let's go for it, boys. Red Cross, begin firing. We failed again. What now? Look, Godzilla's not heading\ntowards the Kyoto tower. Vacate the building. Vacate the building\nas soon as you can. Vacate the building. Get out now, Godzilla's coming. Professor, do you think\nthe baby's called her here? Is there strong room here.. ..where we can contain baby Godzilla? So that Godzilla doesn't\nsense her emotions, and returns. Saluja, we'll take him\nto the underground storage cell. Baby. I think that day Godzilla\nwas at the island for a reason. He was there to protect his egg. Godzilla is here. He's above us. Don't be scared. She's gone back. Sir, I.. Actually,\nsir...I went on a vacation, and.. I still have my leaves, sir. Next time you take a vacation,\ntake my permission. Otherwise, you'll regret it. Do you understand? Well...I'll let you go this time. Catch. Flight pilot Robert George.. ..will have to work at car-parking. Yes, that's what's\nwritten in there, Robert. Now get out and goodbye. Come in. Excuse me, sir. You, here? Baby. You just ate,\nyou're hungry again. Okay, eat some more. Here. This is a wonderful place. The baby will like growing up here. Well, this is where\nhe's going to stay now. He's your responsibility now. I have you've no objection.\n- Not at all, sir. Look after him, miss. You know he's a unique animal. Welding team, come to sector 3. We'll have to fix the couplings first. If we use the artificial\ndiamond coating again.. ..then it'll certainly do the trick. According to me,\nthe plasma energy port.. ..should be fixed there. The professor at National\nInstitute of Bio-techniques.. ..has given us an important news. He found out that the baby Godzilla.. ..which they have in possession,\nhas another set of brain. Then Godzilla should\nhave two brains as well. Correct. What do you mean? We'll bring some changes\nin Mahabali's attack plan. We'll target this weakness. Next time we'll target\nhis second brain. We've a codename for\nthis new attack plan. G-Crusher. This will paralyse Godzilla. Because without a brain,\nhe'll be unable to stand. I've heard that you're thinking.. ..about making Mahabali stronger. Did I hear it right, Professor? Stop this. It's not impossible. Why don't we modify Garuda One, sir? By inculcating Garuda One.. ..we can make Mahabali\nmore powerful, sir. But how can we connect\nGaruda with Mahabali? It is possible, sir. We've to make some\nchanges in the design. You're right. You should be promoted for this. Baby, what are you doing? Good boys are not mischievous. Naughty. Hi, baby. What is that? This is my new flying machine, baby. Call him baby, not me. I am sorry. What's going on? It's all baby's doing. Baby, be quiet. You got promoted? - Yes. I'm in the flying squad again. That's good. What's that? This is my new robot. I call it a Giant Bird. You know it can fly. - Really. Sit behind me,\nI'll take you for a ride. Wear this. Suits you. Hold on tight. Baby. Saluja, you should\nmarry a billionaire. Really? Tell me why? Because he should build\na huge manor for you. Right, here we go. Oh my, God! Your flying machine\nis good for nothing. Come, children. Come in. You all here? They are here to meet Baby. Are they from ESP school? - Yes. Hello, aunty. - Hello. Look. It's beautiful. Look at his teeth, it's huge. You won't believe it. The children have memorized\nthe music from the plant. Really? Children, sing that song for Baby. Yes, we'll hear it too. Okay. Baby. - What's wrong? What? Baby. Baby. Baby. What's the matter? No, baby. I don't understand. What's wrong with him? He seems restless. It must be the song. - Song? Yes. Remember,\nthe first we played this song.. ..that's when the egg\nhatched and baby came out. Whenever he hears that plant song.. ..he gets unbelievable strength. This plan is we take Godzilla\nto a designated place somehow. We've already chosen the place. Obasawara Islands. It's far away, and no one lives there. There's just one way to do that. We take Godzilla's baby there. But the kid can die too. There's no other way. We'll have to sacrifice the baby. Please don't risk the baby's life. Like I said, we're helpless. When we send Mahabali to attack.. ..you will be in the cockpit as well. Why me? Because my dear, to find out.. ..the position of\nGodzilla's second brain. Believe me, this is very important. I beg you, please stop this. I understand your emotions. This Baby dinosaur has\ngiven us a golden opportunity.. ..to finish off Godzilla. Baby is not some opportunity. He's a mute animal,\nwho has the right to live. He has the right to live,\njust like you and I. Wait a moment,\nwe at G-Force have a responsibility. To save humans and earth\nfrom the attacks of Godzilla. If we have to sacrifice\nan animal to save humanity.. ..then, there's nothing wrong in it. I always thought\nthat killing Godzilla.. ..is just another duty for the humans. But I can't think the same now. And Baby's responsible for it. I feel pity for it. Whenever I see this\n6.5 billion year old baby. I think we're too early. - Early? Just imagine, dinosaurs ruled\nthe earth for 10.5 million years. And humans have been living\non earth only for 3 million years. Just imagine, dinosaurs\ncan come back into existence. Come on. Come on, good boy. There you go. Come on. Come on. He's scared. Baby. Baby. Sorry, miss. You'll have to come down. I'll stay with him. Please close the door. What are you saying? Baby needs me. Don't be scared. Everything will be fine. Alright, close the door. Baby. Don't be scared. I am with you.\nEverything will be fine. This is Lizard One, crossed 167. Roger, Lizard one. What time will 'Mahabali' take off? At...5 o'clock, sir. We've just received\nnews from camp, sir. 10 minutes ago a giant\nbird was spotted near Amori. Giant bird? What kind? It's on the screen, sir. What's this? That's a Radon. - Radon. Radon's alive. Look. The giant bird's heading east. It's close to Shanghai. Now it's heading south, sir. But where is it heading? I feel baby Godzilla's\neyes turned red due to fear. He knew...that Radon's\ngoing to attack him. Because he knows\nthat Radon is his enemy. Instruct Alpha One to return. Roger, we're returning to base. Over. Baby! Baby! Alpha One. Are you listening? Answer me. 15 minutes to take off. Robert, the baby Godzilla\ncontainer's gone missing. What? Move. All systems check, sir. Target systems are okay, sir. Johnson, keep Garuda's\nflight level at 100. Johnson, are you listening? Johnson, why aren't you answering? It's me, sir, not Johnson. Who? - It's Robert, sir. I am sorry, sir, I am helpless. I've to get to Saluja right now. Changing to flight level 100, sir. Sir, Radon has landed. G base to Mahabali and Garuda. Hurry up. Radon has landed. He's trying to break the container. Oh no! There he is. Prepare to land. - Roger. He's firing laser beams.\n- Just like Godzilla. Shall we fire the plasma beam? Wait. Robert, we're about\nto fire the plasma beams. Try to take Radon\naway from the container. Okay. I won't spare Radon. Turn around and open\nthe energy storage. Fire plasma grenade. Mahabali's right eye\nhas been damaged, sir. Fire! Saluja! Are you okay? Come on, hurry up. Answer me. Saluja. Yes, sir. I am absolutely fine. Baby's fine too. Move aside, Professor. We won't be able to open this thing. We'll have to cut through. Come on, start cutting. Godzilla's coming! Godzilla's coming! Godzilla's coming! Godzilla's coming! Look. Godzilla's coming! Look. Godzilla's here too. Turn around. Garuda. Garuda. We've lost contact with Garuda, sir. Plasma energy on. The energy's been drained, sir.\nThere's nothing we can do. Oh no.. Turn on emergency systems, quickly. Okay. What's the damage level? The damage level is 8, sir. We can't hold on for too long. Robert, are you listening? Hurry up, Robert, Godzilla's here. Godzilla! Let's go. You arrived at the right moment. You had me worried. Robert, had you gone\nfor another vacation? I don't want to work\nat the car parking again, sir. Let's go. Right. Sir, boosters. At full power. Fuse...Garuda with Mahabali. - Roger. Garuda has fused\nwith Mahabali. - Good. Garuda, aim the ray\ncannons at Godzilla. Roger. Fire...all weapons. Firing, sir. Plasma grenades on stand-by. Firing paralyzing missiles. Prepare the G-Crusher. Okay. Depression is complete. Do as you've told. Do it. Do it. Do it, Misha. She found the other brain. Fire. Commence discharge. Godzilla's been defeated. We finally won. Commander, we've done it. Sorry, sir. I've to go. Robert, where are you going? Saluja. Are you listening? Are you okay? Saluja. Yes, I am fine. Alright, finish it. Baby. Radon's still alive. What's that energy? That's Radon's energy. He's given all his power to Godzilla. What's going on down there? Godzilla's other\nbrain is mending itself. My, God. How is that possible? Impossible. The armor plate is melting. There's nothing we can do, sir. Put on the emergency suits. We won't accept defeat. Sir.. Emergency escape system\nhas been activated. Emergency.. Damage level 1o. This robot is completely damaged. No survivors. Damage level 1o. This robot is completely damaged. No survivors. We've survived. The computer was fooled too. Saluja, Robert, quickly. Baby, you will have to go. You're not safe with us. There's no other option. Baby. I won't be able to look after you. I am so sorry. Baby. I can't stay with you. Try to understand. My Baby. Look after yourself...Baby. Goodbye. Misha, this is Saluja. Can you hear me? Please, Misha,\ntry to talk to Baby through telepathy. Tell him that I am not his mother. Godzilla's his mother. And he'll have to go with her.\n- I'll try. Baby, you're not safe amongst humans. Me or Saluja,\nwhom you think as your mother.. ..cannot protect you. Our world is based on hatred. You've your mother,\nwho's a epitome of motherhood. You will have to go with your mother. Because we humans are\nnot worthy of raising you. Your life,\nyour world is with your mother.. ..where there's no war,\nweapons or hatred. There's only love. Only love. This is an image of love and care. What do we do, sir? What we should do to live on. It's been proven that 'Live\nand Let Live' is the best motto. Goodbye...Baby. And goodbye...Godzilla. After humans have\nannihilated themselves.. ..from the face of the earth,\nmaybe dinosaurs will rule again. I am certain they will. To awaken the feeling of\nlove and caring amongst humans. They certainly will.", "3U-VUa1amxo": "hi guys I sounded like that sure but John Buck wanted to come in on the phone as well as I said in their description um last video well we're back a young

going on this is dr. Mike Hansen and in\u00a0\nthis video we're talking about CBD what is CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the story behind cannabidiol the cannabis product\u00a0\nthat gets you well not high you've heard of CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the cannabis product whose popularity has reached\u00a0\nalmost crazed lake proportions CBD has come from\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere to everywhere in just the last few years\u00a0\nit is perhaps best known for its ability to\u00a0\u00a0 reduce anxiety and promote happiness but CBDs\u00a0\napplications are seemingly endless it's been\u00a0\u00a0 successfully used to help with pain insomnia and\u00a0\ndepression there are some reports that it helps\u00a0\u00a0 with other medical conditions as well because\u00a0\nof its wide range of uses CBD infused products\u00a0\u00a0 are the fastest growing segment of the health\u00a0\nindustry even some pets are getting in on the\u00a0\u00a0 action for example CBD troubles are used to calm\u00a0\ndogs Carl's jr. the fast food chain has created a\u00a0\u00a0 burger served with a CBD infused sauce not that\u00a0\nI endorse calls jr. or any fast food for that\u00a0\u00a0 matter and New York City CBD infused coffee was\u00a0\nall the rage and sell at the camp and then there\u00a0\u00a0 is medical celebrities dr. oz and dr. Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a lot coming down the pike and\u00a0\nif you want to know more about CBD or if you\u00a0\u00a0 have questions about it put it in the comments\u00a0\nbelow and make sure to give this video like
