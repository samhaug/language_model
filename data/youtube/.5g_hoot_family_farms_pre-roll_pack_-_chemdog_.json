{"CJu-Tdlnvxw": "so that's that's where it all began right here in sisters you can see our greenhouses down through here which you won't do this year oh no we'll we'll start early next year super excited about that and then behind it you'll see our teepees and that's the sykes another crazy sykes invention right there but you know i'm a i'm a believer in necessity i i may not be able to afford fancy but if it works at least in my mind i'm gonna try it and then if it really works i look like this crazy goofball because it's something that nobody's seen that before but we we have a very special climate in the high desert right so it's dry and we have an afternoon breeze every day that you can almost count your watch to and so mother nature will help you dry and then the rest with the idea you know i drive through farms or different agricultural products and i look at it and i was going through tri-cities and they had these huge poles and pulley systems over these crops and i was looking at a very high-tech hot farm and i was wrapping my head around that as i was going through and that's how this tp idea came up hey there bailey sweet with harvest helper trim store i'm in the beautiful bend oregon i'm at big top farm and i'm taking a tour on some new methods that are really interesting i thought you guys would like to see this this is sykes mitchell's teepee and you can see how windy it is and these are just flowing like sheets but not going crazy there's look at these looks on the ground there's almost nothing so it's just literally protecting itself it's like nature's drying right here the bud has a nice nice texture so sykes already has all of his plants out of the ground but we're gonna go from that point from the point of the plants coming out of the ground through his whole process there's automated drying his separating his uh bucking trimming packaging sorting inventory all the things he has to go through to make this come together and happen and grow year after year all right so we cut the tops okay we cut the tops and then we hang the tops these are the tops and then we move and we label everything so we know what part of the fuel it came from the day it came down we cut this is the fun part this is an oregon cbd field right here we cut this field four times before we harvested it we took four thousand pounds an acre off of this field after we cut it four times wow really really really happy about how this field worked and this is this is why you just why would you try anybody else's genetics right yeah i did but you i mean they're just that good that's i got a lady in utah right now that i've been selling equipment too and she used oregon cbd and she is doing so much better than her peers that did not oh i'm sure i i and i don't know what their growing climate is but it's just such a consistent product yeah and that so that's the other thing too is that you're you're really in an area that i mean i guess we're in areas that are so moist like you're just in the ideal climate for this it really is it's a great climate for us do you think that it'll become uh for hemp that you know i think that's probably the best question you've asked me so far i think i think central oregon is going to be the sonoma of hemp when the word finally gets out that everybody sees what you go through to get the best right product your consistency is going to come from central oregon you're not going to have the seating issues the mold issues and and you know if you have a a gene or a strain that can finish early which is what we're talking about with oregon cbd and the genetics you you can plan it and you can count on it finishing out and getting it out of the field before the weather changes and that's everything just that like you're reducing that gamble so this is the light depths and then we've just converted light depths into storage this one here is uh this is the original one that we had on the other side of the field and the neighbor said you know i hope you guys have all the success in the world but you put the greenhouse right in the view of the only mountain view i've got i said well if we have a good year we'll move it so he took it from that end of the field on wheels and rolled it here you're such a good neighbor rhonda working on some of the drying racks one of our girls so how long does this hang for uh you know we try and cure it for you know between nine and fourteen days in in with the dehumidifiers in in this situation that's about what we get out of it take it down i am just carefully brushing dried wet trim from the rack into the tote so we wet trim these and then rack them and it makes it a really it's a different product than some of the other ones off the stem but it's it's ready really quick so during a harvest season when somebody goes oh come on you got to have something ready yeah we run them through the t4s yeah and then in the t2 that we got from you and then we put them on the rack and we can dry them and the rack is is fun and we give it a pop so we don't have flat spots so we have a rack pop right you know i try and come through here and give them a snack and flip oh yeah just like that and they they bounce in there okay um a lot of these once they're filled up and this is the finished product of course isn't that pretty that is pretty oh look at that this was wet trim yep you didn't even lose the nose no no that's it we we did it at a necessity for markets and and people were like you're going to ruin it it's like no i don't think i'd do it if it was going to ruin it yeah at least not twice in a row yeah but these are and you can find that peach now in there although the wind is a little glowy today um the hairs are all intact yeah let's get a close up smell it blue tinted one so those were had a little bit of look at the crystals on that [Music] that's the goliath too yep yep so same strain just has some that come out yeah various what causes that do you know well it's just a you know different phenotypes in the in the strain yeah and that's and they have a strawberry and a grape smell and then they have the peach smell and they're all in the same bag of seeds yeah it's because they're getting it from the seeds right right right so is this your purple yeah oh there they are yeah look at that one and that perfect purple so this would be another phenotype of the goliath yeah and we had a guy that just he wanted 60 pounds of just the purple so pam went out and just picked hand-picked purple before the frost cave so is that part of why you like doing it right from the seats too is it you get the different varieties oh yeah and you know and the other thing is with the high desert we get we get the diurnal temperature change so you know at night we're going to drop into that freezing range we're going to between 28 and 32 degrees and then it goes it can go back up to 90 degrees and that is what makes them make the oil and it's why we get that purple without mold a lot of places in the country that grow a purple flower people are really leery because they figure it's been in the field so long that it turned purple or maturity and it probably has mold from rain well we're in the desert that purple is caused from that diorama change so it's just and there's a purple look at that one look at that one that is covergirl purple variety i just think they're sexy they look like jewels it's true notice the colors out and about and this is from the seahawk that how bad i hate dust so yeah it was a great combination this is from the uh it's from the seahawks turf they he went and picked it all up so maybe there we are again how much did that cost you to order seahawk turf well we just when they replaced it we got it from a replacement company and basically we just paid the shipping to get it to us and they just shipped it to you just for cost yeah because they they they don't want them in the landfill they're really hard on the landfill yeah so they've tried to fight people that want it and i thought it'd be great to just lay it down where high traffic area is no doubt the pro football games have been played on this process that's the rumor but this is where it all started so in the winter we had a uh the little heater over here and the girls on the trim rack and you know we've been doing flour as long as anybody but i know i mean four years now we've been in the flower business but the biomass you know it's in the tank right now but it's always been our secondary product yeah this is what we're we want to do flowers we want to be you know hey it's gonna be a flower yeah in the biomass do you think it's it was just bad because there was such a flood last year flooded out and now the people that are not in it anymore that are sitting in barns full of bags are willing to let it go for nothing so next year the year after yeah they're thinking by march we should see a change in pricing which would be nice but it's you can't count on anything but knowing half the market went that's in business this year went cbg yeah and half of it's in cbd that's just gonna eventually you know supply and demand we're going to go through that supply and then the demand will go back up but yeah you know it is next year the pla the year to go beggars the next year to hold back those are all the cards we got to you know guess on later yeah you see that uh-huh wow and this there's no flower after this it gets compressed into a 1500 pound bale okay uh jeffrey how did you get mixed up with psychics and what do you do here um title well i'm a vp of operations for a few different companies okay the first of which is imperial seedlings we're a genetic genetics advisement company and a seedling provider to the hemp industry okay so we provide genetic advisement and then the subsequent seedlings crop advisement and then post harvest biology's advisement as a as that company and is that specific to oregon or nationwide that's nationwide yes we're one of the few companies that ship some seedlings nationwide and we're going international with cuts here shortly so excited about the prospects okay all right that's one the next two uh two would be distributorship it's called elevated distributing elevated distributing elevated works with the farms uh in their post-harvest processings with a jv partner from assure technologies as a duo we provide the post-harvest advisement processing desiccation trimming bagging and then through elevated the sale of said product either into processed goods not for cgp or for small cool fun okay all right can you tell us your process here in the harvesting aspect so for the for the harvesting aspect that's really one of the better parts of the new technology that we're bringing to bear in the market and that is a drying process that doesn't exceed 72 degrees and will dry product in 48 hours so we've launched our beta test this year with great success here on big top farms okay and are hoping to launch uh duplicity into the market next year providing hubs for farmers to bring their material to where it can be processed in a timely fashion at scale and still have the idea of valued constituent preservation in mind okay so since you've been operating this system here with the amount of product that was brought in do you was there time in the harvest season to bring on product here for other people or would there be next year this year there wasn't right now we only brought four units um the output of those units on average is about 500 to 700 pounds of dried material per day okay and so next year the idea with duplicity is to bring multiples of those to a hub here in central oregon southwest oregon uh north of bakersfield a few other parts of the country so that we can provide hubs for farmers to bring their product in to be processed much like that of other commoditized crops okay so what we're gonna see is essentially a pilot project with four dryers correct correct are we gonna follow him [Music] let's start here just as an example so we cut to size in the field so that we're if we're having scissor work that scissor work occurs uh in the field we're taking the best of the best smokeable flower and then coming through later with bean pickers or other harvesting technologies to make up for the remainder of the plant okay so as an example this is some product that's come out recently that has been dried uh in about 48 hours and you'll notice it's got a nice crispness to it uh we get the moisture content down to where it's cheap shelf stable and maintains its durability but the temperatures that we're drying out are really focused around the preservation of monoterpenes yeah and cannabinoids yeah so we get a great nose dried down in 48 hours versus the you know seven to ten days or if it's raining even longer right so this is a very consistent process that used uh our new technology yeah i like it it's kind of unbelievable to me honestly machine dried with a nose it's very gentle on the front that's the idea right yeah absolutely yeah we'll show you some of the uh units from the outside of the club yeah absolutely these are the two companies that uh we're in partnership with which is assure technology and aggravation um these four units are the prototype units that will be uh bringing duplicity to the market with next year okay cool yeah so pretty straightforward except for the fact that i can't show you what's inside yeah yeah so like i said there are there are four problems that a lot of people are trying to solve sure we're hoping that we've got the best mousetrap in the business um you know if this if this season uh starting here with sykes there's any indication i think we do yeah we're headed to northern california next to move these units to the next farm they're they're modular this year for that beta testing and then next year we're on the hose the next step well so after it comes out of the dryer right that's what we just looked at it's in the racks here right and normally we're coming out of the field right we would sack it and rack it put it in the machine pull it out 48 hours later at which point it goes into trim okay [Music] yeah which is where companies like yours come into play we need more scale technologies for product that's been dried down and is ready for that process so yeah from basically from these trays into into the trimmers absolutely so pretty straightforward compare to streamline not a lot of moving parts per se um and yeah that's a long shorter yeah pretty good what we're trying to do is avoid you know maybe some of the what's the best way to say this the previous attempts from farms to try and reinvent the wheel yeah uh and and stick to really standardized protocol yeah so we can get a standardized process and a reliable product on the back end so absolutely that's much uh what we're geared towards cool where did you get to work he took me inside and showed me everything everything so you want to run some we want to run some so from the from the racks that come out of the dryer you're going straight into a trimmer you're not bucking it down further right so it's going straight from total we've got some short stacks right now coming off they're all cut to size let's show her that because that would be good right from spain genetic from spain yeah what are you putting in there we're going to put a full 27 gallon toe in and let it run because of after we've ran a few batches through this we like the the dryness is just right so we run it actually sub five minute run and then check it and and it's pretty clean so this has got a pretty fuzzy look to it still got a nice squish in the middle firm but the outside's crumbly bailey is correct me if i'm doing anything out of line so there's a five minute setting and start your engines okay scott we're gonna take a peek at its progress and that's a minute and a half and it's pretty cool when you can reach in this was i remember looking at these big ones going in now that's bigger and you're going to have some difficulty with a bigger one just as it tumbles but to have those be a good portion of what you've done in a minute and a half that makes it all worthwhile to me and then this will all go on a conveyor for the the snip we'll look for any of those crow's feet and the final it'll just drop in the bucket and you know our customers of course they want this broke down but for us to go and be able to break this down and clean it up that fast is really that's why you're here it's what we want to see in a machine that does it really really good just like that pretty good so how long did we trim that 27 gallon tone before uh maybe two minutes two minutes in the back keep it this exact same one this is the fuzzy going in and you just saw the results coming out actually you should walk that over to the tote that's down there um i wish i had my gloves on yeah no it's cool let's do this comment feedback for you yeah nerd boys out there waiting for you so oh yeah before and after two minutes and there's a few of these are good side-by-side comparisons they went in like that in two minutes so fresh out of the batch one this this batch went for about four or five minutes it had a little more moisture in it [Music] but we need to know if we're having shrink if we have a moisture issue if we're too dry or too wet um that's that's one of our ways of knowing our weights where we're at and then of course i wish i would have invested in freaking bots [Laughter] it's crazy but there's just a lot of it so this one's a different batch number upper innis still in the goliath cultivar but also lime green so there's two lime greens lower in this upper in us as we swept through the field taking those out and some of that you know we have markets in that we found this last year everybody was looking for the lime green whether they're doing a delta eight spray or they're just in a part of the country that does not understand purple right and we've got other people that want purple so we just separated them so it's easier for them they can be easier yeah and some people want to put all purple in the jar that's right and it goes and goes and goes just down yeah and this is just being dried yeah we just we brought some of the flowers in and we're just slow curing them in here they're getting closer but they're i think they've got another by the feel of it i'll tell you they got another probably four days to get there and then those are those are marked as well so that we can come up here and when we tote them we know what we've got okay and it's just trying to stay organized yeah so it just it doesn't do any good to have them all in a pile yeah i think you got we got some really good stuff here people the buyers nowadays want to know exactly what they're getting and they want to know how many pounds behind it exactly so you know again and we we did 30 acres of the of the goliath in about 35 acres of the oregon cbd and the goliath because it's compliant and and we have the coas it's going to be pretty popular yeah so we're happy to have the batches and and you know the stores and the buyers that are going they want to know okay you've got 550 pounds of the green goliath from upper moody with a coa we want it yeah yeah so that's that's what we're trying to do as the farm is just be more organized so the buyer wants to come back it's not a it's not a bad experience [Music] right i wanted 50 pounds of purp so we got a perps so is this bag ready for most of your buyers or do you have to tighten it up a bit or is that well no this this guy wanted a machine so this is ready as far as a machine it's perfect but now hand trim you got to clean it up a lot we're pretty we have a pretty tight trim on that but that's not what this is this is this is a machine trim so they're they're okay with that and they they like the color and if they want to trim it down you know we're priced accordingly so yeah you know machine trim is not going to be anything like the hand trimming yeah cool yeah that one's green let's check um it's green same exact stream just a different oh yeah look at the difference yeah that's the only thing i see in the bags of like when i looked on.com i wasn't seeing like shredded like flour yeah so our some of our some of our best clients that buy from us regularly have sites on youtube whatever social media outlet that they have and they take it out of the bag this is from big top farms and they strip it off even the the last of the tip of the stem right yeah and grind it in front of you and they tell you what store they're going to tomorrow and the next day and he goes i can't keep it in the house but he's telling him where he's going and who's going to get the goodies next and we just get it to him that's our job just give it to him and that guy is all about the quality it's not about the price we walked into texas stores and you know the guy behind the counter is like i don't know where it came from midwest yeah well let's see it and opens up a like an oatmeal can pours it on the counter and there's stems and seeds and crap and it's like wow people like that he goes they like the price it's 9.99 i'm like it's horrible yeah it's i don't even see a flower in there but um people will figure it out and it's just it's no different than what we were talking about earlier with the stores um that's where people try it they're like wow we did the cbd and it didn't work well try ours and and we get we get some comebacks to it but you you just know there's a lot of people i'm not trying again at 40 bucks to have failure why would i do that and and i'm sitting in line to buy something i'm looking at these little racks with cbd blah blah blah and there's nothing in it and it's like you're just capturing the sexy part of the cbd sales right now and you're ruining it for these because people aren't getting the results exactly and you know small boutique farmers that are trying to you know march forward with this new medicine are getting you know snuffed by the big guys that all they're doing is chasing the dollar yep one of the things that we've done with our products is we've given a lot of our product away and to family friends people that have problems cancer we've been giving away free since we started to anybody that has cancer we just give it to you right you don't want to try it don't but if you're interested that you're in pain or you're going through this we just get it to you and it's amazing how many people and how many people's family are like you guys are just doing incredible stuff yeah well we've we've really wanted to know that it actually works for people you want realtors all of my products so it's not just coming from a lab we've got recipes that have been developed in-house some of them are old family recipes from some of our team for like the soap and the lotions but but we want to know that it's actually going to work before we've ever put our name on it and put it on the shelf so it's taken us a while to actually get our consumer product line up but that was why because we truly wanted to make sure they were products that were going to be effective exactly", "pcza6M4ZXc8": "[Music] Hemme dog and Sour Diesel raised the bar and brought awareness to it to the public that you know that there is something better out there I would say that maybe 75 to 80 percent of the strains out there today and spawned off of the cam dog 91 a lot of other strains out there have become dog in it nowadays it was one of the first you know it's like the pioneer of the beginning of the of the whole movement of time but Norman I started to smoke and read in 1989 88 so in Massachusetts it wasn't it was kind of hard to find her there wasn't like you know a lot of it was just a brick leach it back you know hi guys this is Kevin dog um I was a guy that started the 1991 chem dog seed and well first you gotta spell it the right way if you want to talk its do Gigi I don't know where everybody gets his da weg from my cringe and I see that okay I grew up you know a normal kid and raced motorcycles dirt bikes normal you know I started smoking pot and I really like pop I always would scout out try to go find a good bag of you know went to the dead a few times and when I would go to the dead I would go search around for dinner but a lot and you would find it there because everybody was from different states and all got together and everybody brought their goods there obviously these guys walked by and said time but kind but nice okay cool and I smoked this and it was it was the most craziest tasting but I've ever smoked very skunky sweet pungent 'if you li like you know like almost like sour OG camel and one it was a craziest flavor I've ever smoked the first one I met him they said some people call it dog but some people call it can weed because what they think to this day was sourced out from Northern California Southern Oregon till Thursday we don't know where it came from thank God exchanged phone numbers we kept in touch in August they had gotten in some announce of the cabin dog 91 sent to me I had found 13 seats so I decided to start him I I didn't start all my started four of them one was the camp a b c and d one was a male I threw out I wish I had that male to this day when I started you know growing the bud and giving it to people I'd go to dead shows and people would come with scouting for him you come running at me but I had to actually limit input because people would I want it off I want it off I was working as an intern at wetlands and you know he ran up to me it was like check this [ __ ] out and he pulled out that was the first time I'd ever seen the chem 91 pretty soon I was calling him like you know every week trying to get as much chem dog as possible 2010 2009 is when the height kind of started it was very underground till then before that it was always on forums and people just started to realize you know some of the best or but they never smoked you know chem dog is more famous now than back in the 90s because you were more underground back in the nineties you weren't out and about you weren't on social media there was cam dog is more famous now than it ever has been within the last three four years I feel I'm glad I preserved it and you know and still to this day the original clone cup of the 1991 is still all around I can go out anywhere around here no one even knows who the hell I am really I'm just normal person and I love that I don't care about the fame you know I have a family I have a life I have kids you know hash tag family first as far as I'm concerned I'm glad I did what I did because you know there'd be no chem dog no Sour Diesel straight up there'd be no cam dog and no Sour Diesel fight about that see it's like the pioneer of the beginning of the of the whole movement of kind bug movement [Music]", "56w8t-RPo5Y": "what's up cannabis community friends and family today we're here to talk about lolo never heard of it before but we're gonna compare it to these babies since it's the same exact strain and see which one's actually better these come in a pack of seven i have definitely blown through all of them so there's nothing left to really you know show you but i can go over it um i know that honeydew farms does come in a pack of you know singles like they come either single or in a pack of seven just like this one but um yeah lolo let's scope this out really quick never really heard of it never seen it but i ordered this on ease it was really cheap these gave me like this 30 credit out of nowhere since i don't really use it and i used it and i ended up getting like three of these for six bucks which is insane because they're like seven to twelve bucks each so getting all three for six and free delivery was a hookup thanks shout out to that but um check this video this one i mean they both i mean i can't show you but i've smoked these for so long i know very well exactly what they're like very smooth but as far as the smell this smells not more potent i would say but you can smell more terpenes in it like it's giving off more of an aroma than these are which doesn't mean it's any better not any worse just a note but we're gonna spark this up and let you know how it tastes okay so right off the bat i can tell you that um honeydew farms does have a better flavor and better taste with theirs but um this is sunday driver reading at 20.06 percent thc this one i don't have it on here exactly the bag but this was about the same it was about 20 point something percent so they're honestly identical as far as that same strain same thc percentage as far as growing conditions uh the honeydew farms is from santa barbara southern california and the lolo is from northern california so that's the only biggest difference i guess besides being a completely different brand is where they're grown both going in california socal norcal both really good if you see either of these lolo or honeydew farms be sure to grab them my final conclusion with these is that if you are on a budget these are cheaper than honeydew farms but if you got the dough i would go with the honeydew farms you know but this by any stretch of the imagination is not a bad pre-roll this is not a bad strain this is not a bad company to my knowledge you know it's actually really good it's very stoning it kind of takes me to settle in as joints usually do if i had to pick i would stick to my tried and true honeydew farms but this it's great honestly i [ __ ] with this", "Psy4AsKl8Qs": "I was cracking YouTube you know it's your boy Jay rock from which over here the Chinese place hey stop like the video comment up to

toothpicks yeah we're also going to take a look at some pre-rolls though first coming up looking at how pre-rolls increased 20 of sales during the pandemic during 2020. welcome back to the talking hedge i'm josh kinkade capital markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast so cannabis pre-rolls are outperforming the overall market growth uh pre-rolls surging nearly 50 from last year in in key recreational states uh obviously spurred by that pandemic so becoming the second fastest growing product category behind flower cannabis consumers continue to shop for value and convenience so price and convenience the number two number one and number two thing that any consumer is looking at price and convenience cannabis being no different maybe that's because it's maturing so in case you didn't know pre-roll is the commonly used industry term for a professionally rolled marijuana cigarette otherwise known as a joint thank you mj business daily so headset data analytics company is looking at recreational markets in pre-rolls for california colorado nevada oregon and then washington as well so increasing up 47.1 percent that's a total of 640 million dollars in 2019 to 941 million in 2020 so outpacing the total marijuana market growing by 39 during the same time period only flower grew by more at 54 percent so 2020 pre-rolls had a 10 category market share by total sales up from nine and a half in 2019. so looking at information from leaflink in los angeles in new york reporting that sales of pre-rules are up on the national level sales of product categories increasing 144 year-over-year and in january of 2021 pre-rolls made up 7.94 of the total market share an increase of 1.7 so why are pre-rolls performing so well well there's several explanations looking at some a couple of them being that it's a good way for consumers to experiment so if you want to spend you know 10 bucks and try a couple of different strains and see how that affects you know how it affects you maybe it's the terpenes maybe it's the flavonoids maybe it's the high percentage of cbd and or thc people want to try different things so same thing probably when you if or when you tried alcohol maybe you liked one thing and not another so great opportunity for that another one is that there's no longer a way to sell one gram packages so maybe there's um you know sub grams if you want to try a third or a half gram that's that opportunity people that want to try small stuff another thing easy to use new entrance to the market so if you don't have a bong if you don't have a dab rig if you don't want to buy anything um pre-rolls are the way to go so in washington state number one demographic for pre-rolls is white women over the age of 50 and that's probably the soccer mom who doesn't want to have anything just burn it down and toss it so convenience i guess is back to that factor so not a lot of people are going to want to spend 300 on a dab rig or you know anything else they just kind of want to grab it go think about what you do or what people do in the grocery store with alcohol they'll go and buy some beer and they you know drink it and they throw it away so the whole ritual of having an expensive apparatus is probably not going to fit for a lot of people and then finally another um reason for the proliferation of pre-rolls is looking at um poor quality shake and trim a lot of companies aren't wanting that and so looking for high quality flower and so there's some companies out there specializing in high quality pre-rolls apparently so this article goes into asking a few people around the country on their take on pre-rolls in michigan there's an individual chief development officer for a particular brand who said that there's a huge increase in sales of pre-roll since last year again that is in ann arbor michigan and then down to pre-rolls being a great way for consumers to try out new strains that was the reason behind that so jim belushi's farm in southern oregon said that pre-rolls make up about 35 percent of their company's revenue since the pandemic their joints have jumped about 22 percent year over year labor costs and packaging take up about 75 of the payroll according to belushi and said that the company ruled a quarter of a million joints in 2020 and one of his company's signature products is a six pack of quarter gram joints a lot of people just want to be able to consume that by themselves and not have to put it out burn it down and go looking at the east coast in massachusetts it looks like pre-rolls made up this particular store's sales of 10 percent of store sales and full grand pre-rolls being the biggest in that category selling around 16 in massachusetts they also said that people are buying mini joints that is two half gram joints for twenty dollars or buying in bulk five one gram joints for sixty dollars and in portland maine pre-rolls doubled in sales over the past two years and a lot of that because of you know convenience factors apparently main consumers enjoying new strains uh trying smaller um you know mini joints as they're calling those and then high quality flour is more uh the rule than the exception i'm not really sure why they're throwing that into pre-rolls because if you can't see it how are you going to know that it's high quality so it's interesting that they're kind of lumping that in there so 40 million site sears this year gonna be up in maine hopefully the tourists can help them out because it's not helping out uh nevada at all but uh more of your pre-roll needs come back to the talking hedge with that we're gonna roll this one up i'm josh concave this is the talking hedge oh wait a second forgot about this all right before we burn this one down looking at israeli smokeable cannabis toothpicks at first i thought this was kind of really stupid idea i wasn't sure like if you have a bong what are you gonna do break up a toothpick and then smoke that but essentially what it's for is european and eastern european cannabis smokers who don't really smoke a lot of cannabis so this is something that they're going to have tobacco in and then you literally take the toothpick and then jam it into your spliff so it's toback predominantly tobacco and this is what that's for i'm assuming right so i can just kind of see in this video here that they've got this guy literally just has this um thing that kind of looks like exactly like a toothpick and he just jams that into cigarette and smokes it so kind of a novelty a very small market i would imagine but relevant to to the market over there in uh in eastern europe so kind of looks cool if there was cbd i would definitely shove that in um you know a joint from time to time get a nice little one to one ratio euphoric energetic uplifting kind of like the talking hedge so you come back here to the talking hitch and find out more with that we're gonna roll this one up i'm josh kincaid

welcome for Fox 11 at this illegal pot dispensary but when we went undercover a much different story a quick ID check and we get buzzed in and we're bringing you along as we pull back the curtain on this illegal marijuana operation in unincorporated LA County hey how are you the product is organized and laid out on shelves various different types and amounts of pot indica edibles and Private Reserve but none of it is allowed to be sold here under California law during legal transactions at licensed dispensaries only up to one ounce of cannabis can be sold or purchased but take a listen to how much this illegal dispensary was willing to sell us ok for pound the offer for a pound of weed is 16 times more than what prop 64 allows and it happened right here at 25 Capp located at 47 28 Whittier Boulevard in East LA it's one of many illegal cannabis dispensaries in unincorporated LA County that's where there are no licenses period and that means this pot is unregulated and untested 25 cap never responded to Fox 11 so we decided to pay them a visit in person and see what they had to say my name is Bilbo Lujan I'm a reporter with Fox 11 do you guys have anybody in charge we could talk to real quick yeah you know everything you're doing is illegal here right the employees ended up hiding in the back room only yelling at us over the wall if you guys want to make a comment come on out and talk to us if you want to say whoa no comment all right he'll comment that's fine you guys had a chance but but once a potential customer came inside that window was back open and 25 cat buzz two men hoping to sell him some illegal pot it's amazing to me that they don't follow any the state laws or regulations they violate everything that they know is out there already with prop 64 Brian Blatz is the CEO of one of the largest legal cannabis distribution companies in SoCal we showed him our undercover video and he was shocked by what he saw they're selling pounds of cannabis they know that's going to be resold into a secondary market with people that aren't going to be concerned about the ages of the people that they're selling it to Blatt says people are attracted to illegal pot dispensaries like this because they are not taxed by the state that means the product is sold much cheaper sometimes up to a 50% discount from what you could buy at a licensed dispensary but it comes with the risk I think the most important thing for the general public to understand is that by shopping at any illegal dispensary you're 100% guaranteed to get products that have been untested and that are filled with pesticides chemicals fungus and mold records show that LA County currently has a civil case against 25 caps owner for violating LA County code and unlawful business practices this was after LA County deputies made an undercover purchase of marijuana from that dispensary in March 2017 the case was filed in June 2017 in almost a year later nothing has happened and 25 cap is still up and running no when you take a look at this videotape you realize that there are no rules we showed our undercover video to Bob Lindsey he's a former LSD commander who is now running to be the next LA County Sheriff he's been sounding the alarm about these illegal dispensaries there are no regulations in there she's just answering questions and she's willing to go ahead and sell up to a pound that's not medical use that's not personal use this is in danger the entire community we have to allow that court system to play out we can't control that captain holy Francisco with LASD says despite frustrations with the system their deputies work hard to crack down on illegal dispensaries we go in we've served just since January a 1 we've served 30 search warrants in the unincorporated area of LA County arrested approximately 60 people recovered over 2000 pounds of marijuana and it's just a system in the meantime LA County leaders clearly remain concerned supervisor Hilda Solis sent Fox 11 the following statement saying in part until the county develops comprehensive regulations and licensing protocols we are still playing whack-a-mole with illegal dispensaries I share in my community's frustration with the status quo and until that status quo changes operations like this one will have no reason to stop no matter who shows up at their door and an LA County spokesman told us they are very concerned about the possible dangers of illegal pot dispensaries and they're committed to shutting them down saying to us in part quote the county has undertaken a series of enforcement actions since it was brought to our attention including an undercover purchase in June 2017 the county filed a civil complaint the defendant has failed to respond or appear on numerous occasions a failure that prompted the judge to finally set a default judgment hearing for August 17th the county is confident that it will prevail and they also went on to say that they are very determined to put these dispensaries completely out of business even if it takes a long time to do so this is the Wild West bill that's what a lot of people are saying and the county shares some responsibility in this because this was legalized the sale for people to be able to buy and sell marijuana this went into effect January 1st 2018 the county still for the unincorporated areas of the county they still have not come up with the regulations and the licensing yet so any of these stores that were out there before this law passed they were technically what's supposed to close down and that's technically what they're supposed to do but as you saw LA County sheriff's went in there there still up and running despite that civil case I bill clearly big business all right thank you much", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "-gioVD_G06M": "aarti here for pot zero as you can see in September we were harvesting at the pot cereal plantation and everything was looking fantastic we had a beautiful crop and then something changed and then it hit on October 1st we got 10 inches of snow which complicated our harvest a lot your immediate impression was that it was like an iceberg dead ahead but as things unfolded we started to realize maybe it wasn't so bad and we started to dig colas out of the snow and they were beautiful and the terpenes seemed more intense as it unfolded we started to realize that not only were the terpenes enhanced but when our test results came back we were shocked to see that not only was our THC profiles extremely high in the mid to high 20s but our plants have exceptionally high levels of CBG CBG is the rarest and most valuable cannabinoid as it it's never present in large quantities and we're thrilled to have a bunch of it because it has amazing medical potential and at the same time it actually really enhances the recreational high of marijuana so fantastically what appeared to be an absolute disaster turns out to be the silver lining is that our crop was enhanced by extreme weather events that stress the plants into doing things that they normally don't do unbelievable it ain't warm enough", "pTaKy6gzU4Y": "[Music] this crop has been defoliated and is now spending the rest of a 24 hour period in the darkness the chem 91 skunk va is on the top five list of many old school growers not only does she smell and taste great but the high is extraordinarily good to my nose this weed smells skunky and sour this isn't a plant that fades with grace towards the end of harvest rather than assuming light yellowed purple or pink hues she stays dark green and starts to get rusty spots on the leaves her leaves won't be winning any best looking awards anytime soon but i'm not growing plants for the leaves [Music] this is the joe brand chem 91. or i call it joebrand91 as far as i can tell it's not a very closely related plant to the skunk va as a matter of fact it doesn't seem related to me at all but then again the quote real chem 91 doesn't seem related to the other chems to me either so i don't know [Music] i was told this cut was selected from a group of sour diesel ibl seeds but this plant is very far from an sd ibl in my opinion this joe brand 91 reminds me of a chem d crossed to a chem 4. [Music] this blueberry diesel cultivar is new to our garden [Music] this plant has a very high chance of being used quite often in our garden she's too a lot of good important boxes for us this is our first run with her i've been completely impressed with every aspect of this girl so far i got to smoke an early sample last night interestingly that intense blueberry muffin scent from the live flowers once dried sort of converted to the scent of some rich ripe tropical fruit maybe the blueberry muffin scent will return after a couple of days of cure either way it smelled and tasted great that's the banana tangle foot and she is very very sticky super gooey small little nugs [Music] but uh i think if i had it tested it it would probably be 99.9 resin yeah i'm serious of course i'm not serious but this stuff really is crazy resonance it's not that slick kind of resin either very very thick almost dry resin you", "xIonONKC_YA": "[Music] hey guys what's going on welcome back ten minutes great review today we are going to be reviewing candle [Music] she got me going [Music] this is an awesome strain this is an indica dominant hybrid 50% 55% indica and 45% sativa and he has teach levels up to 20% THC oh yeah oh yeah oh my god that smell is so potent it has that diesel toll smells what is really potent really skunky you can almost also terpenes in it so a little bit a little bit of terpenes like a little bit citrusy but it smells great this is one of those strains that can be read in space you are for hours and when he's back when you when you snap back to to reality and then you look at your time while Chitauri was ours it was only a couple of minutes he's gonna space you're like that oh wow look at this one oh this male only cracked it a little to put in the grinder and Wow let's open now once you crack it you can definitely smell some terpenes a little bit of citrus in there and I it smells really good but the diesel tone smell overpowers it where you can still smell it it's there let me show you guys the buck that's what Gordy's no thanks great good look at the inside oh wow look at that guy go strike oh oh we should have a city your hands I'm sorry I wish I had a 30 in there look at that that is gorgeous you could pause on the screenshot if you watch that is great Wow this drink is best for anxiety and pain you know it also helps up with depression ADHD my even migraines I get these ladies this is strain is great for PMS yeah that's right looking up cam Doug good for PMS oh you're welcome listen gadget oh man there's Mel intensifies and it's always we're gonna be using a green ball so that way we can actually taste the flavor of the cannabis and our prey blender is gonna be doing our the honors Brenda's getting to the others so let's pack them up oh my gosh I'm so good I could eat this I could eat it just like that it smells so good I hope it tastes like it smells then you can smell the champions a lot more you can actually smell it a lot more more citrusy than before oh the cannabis is here any no I'mI'm about arm's length and I can smell it like this is a really really loud yeah [Music] oh he does Oh God tastes that taste is so good he has that sour DISA tone to it it doesn't taste like it tastes better than Sour Diesel it's already so had that still earthy tone to it - more like like a fuel tone are you--is it was a bad but this you can actually chase the terpenes you know we can take some citrusy taste it is really good I mean see how long the chain slices before it loses taste you know easily after a couple of bits of our universal taste let's see it's really smooth it's burning really smooth it's not harsh like some strains that I smoked that's why I preferred babe because it's less harsh and this he hasn't make me coffee yet it still has a taste to it this is my third hit now let's go for the fourth after the word here is not as strong the taste is not as strong as it was with a beautiful person - a beautiful person it was DTC's so good I'm starting to feel it I'm starting to feel the early good yeah but I'm stuck I'm starting to feel it that 20% TAC start to get give me innocence [Music] ok turn on that fort hit that forehead was actually a lot a lot more harsh it's not cached yet I can still see some green over here there's still some green in there there's no longer any flavor in and that was like the 50 right thing but you actually make me cough okay that last hit was super harsh we make me cough a lot it's not all completely burned you can still see some green in this area still see a little bit of green around himself after couple hitch up the coupling it gets really harsh he has no flavor at all I am right now stoned I am really hard really relaxed body he's Rumble five minutes and I feel like it's creeping up on me right now right when I took my three or four hits already I was really feeling it but right now I'm for the night it's intensify my stay high right now in this game like if I was still smoking I'm not add you know I think this is a creeper this is what this is a creeper because it keeps on creeping up on me like I think this is the highest I gotta go and then I just feel even more higher you know what this dream reminds me of if we might smell Girl Scout cookies I haven't had that in the wild but if he Minds my girl called good news it's like a clear hi like I'm not getting like like he's creeping up on me barn I get it too high like I was stuck on stupid or or like no I mean my mind is clear like I could focus or something like if I wanted to do something I've been recreated but if I wanted to do some type of drawing or something I could easily do it right now without fitting night I'm sleeping over on feeling like which is gonna weirder because you know indie guys might put you to sleep and this is an indica hybrid you know is the dominates 55% indica grant takes only five percent more then that's a T beside but still in liquor and but it doesn't feel like it I have a clear head I have a nice body relaxation like most of the candidates and I smoke but I don't feel heavy I don't feel like I should go to sleep I mean it feels really good it is really good that's why it reminds me of Girl Scout cookies the taste was really good I like those two things you can taste and when you start burning them the smell is great I really like it no I just packed a new bowl because she's so good tastes so good if I have to give it a rating let's just say I'll give how many leaves would I give it yeah it's not give it start let's given leaves I'll give it a seven I give it seven leaves because it's not bad at all it doesn't cloud your thinking so if I want to draw something will be good it's a nice clear high my body is relaxed it's pretty good for a lot of things in between PMS ladies so if your girl is saying in those days and she's really pissed off just give her a joint that should help it's her there we go but he said we win for everybody he said we would so you know what seven point five we've done it I bring that up seven point five silver and I have leaves just because is that we went for everybody all

hemp was a crop that was grown here back in the 1800s we have over the years bred something that has the stability the tenacity the output that we're looking for in the Northeast what it does in the field in a hundred days is just amazing it was this like glorious start to finish [Music] our extraction process is quite different in the sense we take a whole plant and extract the way nature intended it to be and so the plants need to no treatment no pesticides nothing's added or removed I think this is a historical moment it's about time for people to have this choice again [Music] you", "lVZPJ_Gn-Bk": "I have a saying is that we will never say by way into a profit when you start cutting things and you start cutting things out and not not trying to go to them to the next level and sit still you will be a path that will leave you behind it is very important to me that my family continues to this farming operation for years to come if we're going to stay in this business and we're going to be competitive in the world market we have to move our farming operations to the next level we cannot stay at status quo with commodity prices the way they are we have to make more bushels to the acre in order to make money that's what Genesis AG is about it's more bushels per acre and the same applies to our our Tabaka operation we're gonna have to learn how to make more pounds per acre and make them economically and Genesis AG is helping us do that [Music] my name is David Haight Genesis AG is one of the best things that's ever happened to the bike industry far as I'm concerned so we've been using these products for three years we have seen higher higher yields go up by five to six hundred pounds per acre we've averaged right at three thousand pounds per acre in the back of when the county averages or twenty four to twenty five hundred pounds silicate makes it in do a stress better and made a an awesome Proctor by spraying of silicate and carbo's can let us harvest tobacco fifteen to twenty days ahead of normal we we see it speeding up the maturity or century it's been instrumental in helping the farmers in eastern North Carolina fight pitting we had some of the best plants we've ever raised with the healthiest root system we did not have to treat for Pythian because the century took care of that the liberator product it makes our tobacco grow faster and it unlocks the phosphorus that we have stored in our soil reducing the amount of phosphorus we have to apply in season [Music] as far as the people that are set in their ways about farming I think that they just need to have an open mind and just give Genesis AG products a try on a little bit of acreage Oh a little spot and just see [Music] I sit and analyze the the things that I put in my front

are you ready I like weed I really really really like weed so much that if the moment arrived I gladly beat your ass for one ball even though you're my brother I like weed I like balls I even like the leave those games and seeds coming out I still have to see welcome to between two strains uh today we have Josh which is one of the originators of the og movement strain that we all love so much thank you for being on thanks for having me on my pleasure man and tell me something about yourself man where you from I'm from the east coast from New Jersey but moved out here to San Fernando Valley and when I was 14 that was in 1987 and grew up basically here in the valley until about 91 and moved over into Los Angeles nice no how long have you been taught to beg for been doing this better part of 20 plus years I know we're sitting next to one of yours I think you're sitting next to one of yours this it is this is the club 33 what does that streaming to you this strain is defined my life you know where I've moved my work getting this strain out to people so they could have this I always believed that it was some of the finest smoke and it's been a pleasure being a part of it this long I feel I mean I feel blessed to absolutely for crossing paths with this strain when I got it and that was at the very beginning so extremely fortunate to still be working with her and in that now more than ever people get to enjoy her all over the world I get to hear about it and just I take great joy in that oh now you know when I started when I started growing too basically the game was people grew in soil and there were people growing you know indoors in Los Angeles but really I think the hydro game in the mid-90s is what really changed things including this strange so this strain hit the streets at the same time I believe that a new way of growing was developing indoors in Los Angeles let's let's let's get to this the og story how did you get well um in 1996 I had been looking for a place to live and I had two buddies from Florida an old friend in the new friend moved from Gainesville at just finished school at University of Florida we ended up moving into a town house in Silver Lake California at this point I was looking for a house that I could growing for the first time and one of the guys his name's Matt Bubba people know him as and he was one of my roommates so together we kind of you know started growing into this house and he at that time kept talking about this strain that was in Florida and at the time I was growing no5 Hawaiian and l5 purple indica and all these other strains I had gone from Marc Emery up in Canada so he you know I tell him there's no way that you have something better in Florida that we have here in Cali already um so I kind of like edged him on and egged him on and he went out there and he went out there and got some cuts flew back with him in his pocket on the plane and brought it to our place and then showed me how to how to clone and we ended up getting a couple of those plants to root one of them was a cush and there was another one it was a Bubba and there was another variety too that ended up getting phased out did you think it was going to be as big as it was absolutely not oh there's no way like any of us could know what we had right you know though we were of course searching for the best I mean that's what growers do and when we first harvested and had the first taste you know then we knew as we sat there and I mean that was a most stoned I think any of us had been at least for me you know it seemed like somebody forgot to pay the rent for like two months and we smoked it all until it was gone and then it was like wow what the hell was that you know but I had clones of her so we already had another room going and and we were really excited about really real excited about it except that it didn't produce very much I don't that was not you know that was that was the big that was something to be conquered later on you know yeah yeah you definitely conquered that one well I see a lot of people have yeah yeah it's pretty it's pretty great to see what other people are doing I mean I was never I never considered myself you know like a top grower it's been fun to watch now like other communities and other people I know take it to a whole new level and then everybody's sharing the information I mean the the amount of good information now out there that's being shared is incredible I mean I think that is a basis for people to be enjoying you know enjoying this plant at its top form and all over the place I mean that's kind of a new thing right oh geez still hard to come by she's hard to grow right I'd love to light one of these up with you man I got this one you got that one let's just let them both let's just let it both yeah just swap that because it's forever that one's one the other ones the other so just be appropriate so as we light these up man I I think this is the most common question anyone gets asked sure they're in the industry and they're like a budtender you know rowers and all this other stuff that do grow oh gee what does og stand for okay Oh G stands for original okay it was to me it was original to my small crew here that were growing it it was original it turned into original gangster because we live Los Angeles I believe though that the original gangsta wasn't the first name that was added to it to to define this variety you know it was like imagine going around and after the first year of its existence after it had got around town a little because before this strain came out of our crew it was not in Los Angeles so this was a new thing for everybody and people of course started calling um I'll take this yeah we do like that um it was the first time people started calling other varieties that they had cush to sell it so here we were trying to like you know say we were like what kind of cush is this that was the first time it was like well it's the original cush and then you know there are some guys in my circle who were like is the og cush then it turned to the odors and then that was kind of something well we all know that there are different names for this variety as it travelled to different hands to different houses to different counties different cities you know people call it ocean groan I hear that a lot people like it that's cool if it's grown by the ocean for them and they want to call it oh gee ocean grown I mean that to me is fine but it's also to our original circle conative it kind of funny you know because they're claiming in a way as if they had produced that straight they had created that stream and in no way shape or form did I create that strain I was just lucky that it came into my hands here in Los Angeles I was a dedicated grower and I was dedicated to getting some good flowers out there I was happy when I came across the cush I mean it changed my life it created a whole movement out here know the fact that it was oh gee cush after a few years of that then we walked in it's like well what kind of og cush is it you know that it's like you hear all these different varieties coming on talked about this club 33 right next to you actually this is your cut but it is also same as the Illuminati cut right that we do it to coast right exactly it's the same thing the club 33 is just another good example of the plant being cared for by somebody else at a different location and it's with their personality and their style of growing changes the plant in ways because the plants adaptive the resin profile usually stays the same oh but you know the structure and the overall I would say you know quality of the plant and changes you know from from different hands so you know you would expect that right now if you gave the same ingredients to different chefs it would come out you know the dish would always come out different you know and the plan actually adapts to different environments it's fun to watch different the same cut that I had go to different parts of the city even the world and seeing you know how it comes out in different areas different altitudes it's pretty awesome yeah where else can anyone else get you know good if you want the original ojika you can come to coast-to-coast it's the club 33 and the Illuminati this is the this is the same strain that's been going on for 23 years now and if anybody's interested in getting touch with me they can go to my Instagram which is the real og cush story also I just like to give a shout out to the bakery in Seattle my good friends out there and to Oregon kid he's up there and making his way and give a shout out to Soto hydro best hydro store I've ever been to and if you want to see some of my product and it'll be at the bakery in Seattle um and dude I like to thank you very very much too for sitting between two strains with me it's been extremely informative and my head feels very heavy yeah great thank you so much man yeah not so sure thanks for having me on again please thank you this song's done so excuse me while I smoke some weed you", "Uti2Yq-HMvM": "good morning good afternoon wherever you are when I welcome everyone to the American cannabis I'm your host Ellis Smith we want to thank our sponsor cannabis tech and today we're going to be talking about a hemp X or international hip exchange with Mike Lee a go the topic is planting season is approaching are you ready and I've also have John workman from American cannabis as well who heads our hemp divisions and I'm going to kind of give a lot about these two gentlemen before we dive into this this is going to be a very informal conversation today with these guys as one of know Mike Diego for about 15 years and John obviously worked for us for a couple of years and a longtime friend of mine as well and so Mike is great to have you on John great to have you both on thanks for getting on today thanks for having us absolutely thank you so quick little background and that Mike about 15 years ago working in the ski industry he and I both were living in a little small ski town in Silverton Colorado and he was building skis and I was in a pathway trying to be an avalanche forecaster mountain guide and over the years we remained friends group cannabis together watch the industry evolve in front of us and have kind of gone our own ways in the industry and it's cool to see that coming full circle and to really see what you're doing Mike you know you started international hip exchange you're a production specialist at HGH seeds you're co-founder of zoko a co-founder of mahalo wellness and founder of Liberty tree CBD cool to see that you've really taken this direction in him so if you could give me a little background on some of these things that you're involved in and what and what and what they do sure well I appreciate the intro and I jumped into the hemp space out of the marijuana side of the industry in late 2015 started farming quickly rise there's a lot of disconnect in the industry and that people I was going to for advice and know how you know we're uncertain about you know the buyers and the supply chain and the price points and market stability and out of that experience decided to create international hemp exchange and we we founded it as a platform to connect buyers and sellers all across the supply chain we started with a retail platform more geared at companies that we're trying to get their finished products and goods to the market when it was pretty hard to find retail or online presence for CBD products from there it expanded into quite a bit of all sale activity we were the first licensed bonded hemp broker in the United States we started a wholesale exchange which we're going to be relaunching this year and we've been brokering and connecting the dots all along the supply chain ever since and so some of those other projects that you heard about have stemmed out of international health exchange that's really at the core of what I do every day you know the production specialist with HGH seed we're a production partner for HGH up in Oregon hdhd for those of you that don't know is the original when it comes to high CBD hemp seeds particularly feminized variety HGH and Bodi are the original breeders of cherry wine berry blossom trophy wife a whole bottle full bunch others and we really found them to be the most reliable consistent and high quality product on the market and so we do produce seed for them we help them sell seed both nationally and internationally the other brands that you mentioned Joko Liberty Tree mahalo wellness are all different brands that were affiliated with that have different CBD products both functional and not and when I say functional I mean formulated with other ingredients for we've got an energy product to zoko that has some natural caffeine and other herbs we've got some topicals geared towards skincare and things like that but different brands aimed at different niches that we are partnered with one way or another so yeah it kind of come full circle here with you Ellis since we first met and got involved you know I think I was calculating this morning twelve or thirteen years ago we got it did some cannabis together and since then and kind of seen a lot and bounced around and landed in amp and kind of be happier that I did and I have a pretty big reach across the supply chain right now so again happy to be on the call thanks for having us excited for this conversation I appreciate that explanation great to see what you've been doing there come a long way from making skis and doing this and so cool to see the evolution I'm going to turn up with John real quick John appreciated getting on the day John's got a unique background spent many years working the finance world but he's a fourth-generation farmer and brings that kind of caliber to our business for ACC he also does a lot of our financial modeling and business plan writing and just our technical side on both sides of the business and so I'm very grateful to have him on my team and super excited have him on the call today as well as he runs our hemp program so John if you would tell us a little bit about your background your history with the plant I know you had cancer at one point and it was a integral piece to your healing and being where you are today and so give us a little history and background of where you are how you come to help your and acc2 thank you else appreciate it my background is pretty simple I come from reader foundation of being a row crop farmer fourth-generation row crop farmer Wayne Arkansas where we farm for rice soybeans and wheat because currently of 7,000 acres I took the opportunity to move to Los Angeles about 25 years ago while work in the financial markets and with a corporate bond trainer in Randolph it's income trading play a large regional broker dealer in Los Angeles or managed about four billion dollars of securities while I was there I had a snowboarding accident broke a rib in the while they were ready X rating the rib they found a tumor I have multiple myeloma Stage two building their cancer and we've given three years to live at 35 I just passed my 20 year anniversary and cannabis was a big part of the reason I was able to make it through that during my - bone marrow transplants but I speak with a lot of passion about about the hidden effects the medicinal qualities that marijuana and hemp bring to the to the table and the holistic viewpoint is a much better route than the or good approach um as far as my involvement in the hemp industry I was lucky enough to land with American cannabis two years ago where I began as a strategic business consulted writing business plans and pro forma financial models for those wanting to enter the legal marijuana space since then I've been promoting the vice president of business development in the North America and replicated the suite of offerings that we've done for the last six and a half years in the middle in the marijuana industry in the hemp industry so we will they be able to help farmers growers determine what it's going to take to be successful where the risk and how that they can implement a successful program we are currently working with farmers in over 20 20 different states as we help to help them to ascertain cultivars that will grow Stane ibly in their region regardless of climate in soil type but there are lives that one of the biggest challenges we face as we enter the 2019 crop year great well john appreciate getting on and give that explanation as well and super excited have you both on today i'm going to dive in here there was a good introduction let's get kind of get this party started here and talking about some him we've got the great turnout today quite a bit of people have logged in so we want to thank our audience for coming on today the kind of starts us off I want to really dive into the history hemp let's kind of start from where this all begins and so John only you kind of talk a little bit about the history of him from what happened in the 30s the 40s and where we are today with this with this plant cheers well you know the fairies in thirties and 40s are actually implement around long time before that it has been around since 1700 throughout the thousands of years actually um and it's been grown primarily for its industrial applications however in their in the relay Sperry specifically 1937 pimp's being grown in a lot of states the united states for fiber applications and along comes the marijuana prohibition tax and now this mist this became began the beginning of prohibition for marijuana in here it's ironic five years later after we were pulled into mold war ii by the attack on pearl harbor the efforts for the war effort in the following years brought him back into big tent back into production the usda in 1942 contracted over 50,000 acres attempt to be grown by kentucky farmers and there's a real me video called hemp for victory that you can live on youtube and watch it's about 15 minutes long it'll give you a good insight as could be its to the history of health at that time in our country inputs basically grown in 1942 and 43 in 1943 they increase that acreage to approximately 300,000 acres and since that time after the war was over the production of hemp has been reduced to nil until the 2014 farm bill opened up opportunities for pilot programs yep it's a shame to see what our government has done to us and we're learning a different timeframe today to really see things moving forward and so i appreciate that kind of little background in history here that kind of sets the stage of moving forward Mike policy if I go ahead thing L is the point it's interesting to point out everybody remembers the term reefer madness well it's no one has noticed why yeah this thrown out as marijuana was but it's largely due to the lobbyists I feel like in the cotton and timber industries because it was seen as a correct for other industries who were viable or this country and that not happen to leave it in a lot different situations a but the opportunity there lives with where we are in the Dietrich Crowe agreed agreed all right well let's let's uh it's kind of that in the meat of this what is industrial him Mike just give me a quick little explanation of what industrial hemp is okay I'll try and be quick but these days it's gonna work you know industrial guy in Duluth you know right now the technical definition is cannabis sativa L that's under 0.3% THC that's it that's the distinguishing factor between what would be considered marijuana from cannabis sativa and what would be considered half now when we talk about today versus you know the forties and earlier than that industrial hemp at that time was typically food fiber oil it was a fibrous plant it grew tall and skinny you know mostly stock with a little bit of leaf feed and flour on the top of it these days industrial hemp means both that but what's really driving the industry is on the CBD side and high CBD hemp varieties are pretty much indistinguishable from what's known as marijuana and it's going to be grown like marijuana they're going to typically be female plants you're growing for oil and flower production you're going to harvest it a little bit differently and the end product is going to be a little bit different but when you look at the definition by the government its cannabis that's under 0.3% THC now these days we just have our portfolio that is a heck of a lot larger than it was in the 30s and 40s of grains of cannabis that fall onto that zero-point-three definition okay cool thank you for that explanation so that being said you know we with the 2014 farm bill really come out and kind of allow pilot programs to start to happen how's the history that really improved you after year and where are we currently compared to where we were in 2014 as far as acreage coming online to where we are today we're leaps and bounds ahead of where we were jobs in 14 both in terms of acreage in terms of the genetics that were growing in terms of efficiencies and procedures that are in place for farmers to get plants in and out of the field more efficiently we've got you know exponentially more capacity when it comes to drying processing manufacturing but we're still just at the tip of the iceberg so I think we've got some stats here you know 2017 there are about 25,000 acres registered across the country in 2018 that grew to almost 80,000 acres the last stat that I heard for this year is that it's three hundred over three hundred thousand acres have already been registered and that was over a month ago so I really need and we're growing over half a million or at least registering over half a million acres this year for production so that's just a phenomenal feat in such a short amount of time but it's still just just starting to be a blip on the radar when you look at you know overall acreage that's being farmed across the country across different crops that's pretty wild to see little bit just from 2017 to where we are today I mean 25,000 acres to now over 300,000 and you're going to see you say up to happen' million this year that is just absurd to really see the how this is growing leaps and bounds of those numbers how much of that is for CBD production how much do you think that is for Phi and food and these kind of things that's what it might be questions I've always I've always asked how much is it you know divided how divided is it well I think there is an old saying you know follow the money and right now the majority is on the CVD side and so that's kind of where the acreage is going to follow but you can do a lot of green and fiber acreage more efficiently than you can do CVD so there is you know there's there's going to be probably you know I'd say 20 to 30% of that probably grain and fiber we're also at a point where there's a you know there's not a ton of seed that farmers have been used to growing on the grain and fibre size so a lot of those guys are easing into it and then also there's not as much attention and focus on post-processing for that material so there's limited use when you look at the overall abundance of options that M can offer we don't have the capability to utilize a lot of that yet so that's preventing some farmers from jumping in but yeah we're seeing the majority of the acreage that's being registered it's for CBD production I also think it's important to note that even though 500,000 acres might get registered this season that doesn't mean that 500,000 acres gets harvested and that's that's a really important factor I mean this year of the 78,000 that were registered I would be surprised if more than 40 or 50 thousand made it to the finish line I know a lot of acreage that never got planted a lot of acres that you know didn't make it to the finish line a lot of acreage that you know had one problem or another rotted in the field whether so just because acreage this register doesn't mean that it's all getting brown just wanted to clarify that fact those are great points to make so that everybody is aware and in tune that it's not a it's not a you know get-rich-quick scheme it's not a hundred percent success some of these guys probably sealed growler skilled farmers and they may have had their own obstacles of why they didn't make their money or get to get to market with their product so I'm glad you kind of pointed that out kind of thing that the 2018 bill was just sigh and is really kind of driving force now moving forward we're seeing states like my home state of Alabama getting into the game and getting a program started that's super exciting to see they're going to be releasing the awarded order applicants this week and we're super excited to see who was going to be qualified and going to be growing down there and I think we're going to see a lot of other conservative States as well as other just open-minded states in general coming on board and involving the suit so I think half a million acres this year at the pace we're moving out with a farm bill really getting in place and the federal government state you're really putting guidelines in place I think you're going to see this you know explode rapidly pretty quickly in all facets so any comments on that John or Mike I think the 2018 farm bill and I think this year is going to be a USDA vaccine re come out said that they don't have regulations till 2020 crop year so that being said this 19 trop year is going to be driven off this current state regulations with States and so you basically have two different types of states yet states that took advantage of the 14 farm bill when the pilot programs were allowed to be started up and then those are the states that have that the big head start those are the Colorado's organs Kentucky's of the world and then you have the states like Arkansas and Alabama which you're getting ready to launch programs that weren't quite how to put a scene in the ground and so those states will still be operating under most of them under a pilot program so be limited acreage while the other states that were in the 14 farm bill it took advantage that have large large acreage plans for this year and particularly in the states like Kentucky it's interesting to note though how fast on these states can ramp up is 17 for instance Montana had a really small acreage a little around 500 acres the very next year last year they were the leader of twenty two thousand registered acres and and just to support what Mike said it's the number of acres that actually made it to harvest from more lot more mobile most likely less than that and and it's it's always interesting when you get to peek behind the curtain a little bit and we've been in the fortunate position to do so over the years and HAMP and you know the Montana story is an interesting one because a lot of farmers you know someone got duped up there into growing what they thought were high CBD genetics they were going to have a pretty good payday they all signed some pretty similar contracts with pretty much the same group and it turned out that they were growing a fiber variety or a great variety I'm sorry out of Canada from hgi who the investor contract guy was coming up short most of them didn't get through the season with what they were promised I do believe you know most of them were made you know partially or close to full after the season but that was a spike in acreage that you know really didn't affect the CVD market whatsoever and I don't know how much of an effect they had over on the grain side either and I know that it left a sour taste with a bunch of those farmers but we also learned a lot about the Montana growing season and I think there's going to be some great opportunities there but just because they became the leader last year I don't think they led in any other categories in the hemp industry and that statistic on people so that's it you know that is it yeah but going back to the farm bill this year I mean it really blew things wide open for us and you know it would be you know would it be fair to say that it was a hundred percent victory because there are some you know some uncertainties that this brings but it's certainly two steps forward and maybe maybe a hesitation backwards but making tremendous progress and so when I sit you know touch on the uncertainty you know that the farm bill really put some of this into the hands of the FDA and depending on where you are in the industry the FDA I you know has a lot of good things going for it they also have some ties to you know other groups and other industries and you know might not always be looking out for the best interest of the farmer or consumer at the end of the day all matter of perspective but we're working on you know trying to establish between the USDA and the FDA what they're calling in you know regulated pathways to introduce these products into market where I am excited for them to get involved is on the manufacturing side there's a lot of product going into the market right now that isn't what it is claiming to be is putting claims in their marketing saying that it cures this heals that fixes this relieves that there's there's people that are making product in their basement and their bathrooms in their garage you know a lot of that needs to be cleaned up but I'm crossing my fingers that you know the industry and the FDA are able to put our heads together and figure out a path for farmers processors and manufacturers to get this product out to market and not to just buy its hands to pharmaceutical standardized to everything it's got to happen it's there's too much snake oil being being sold out there and we as a company have literally got lots of product and tested it we were looking to white-label something and we just couldn't find consistency and the different vintage we're looking at and to see the test results come back the test results are all over the place and so I know exactly what you're saying and I'm excited for that regulation to come into and clean this up and you give quality product to the end consumer I mean that's what it's all about well none of these farm bills are in place and we've seen this huge spike in an acreage going you know up or planting let's dive into kind of the the meat of what hip farming is and let's discuss kind of you know your background what you're doing Mike now with with seeds and in clones and starts and kind of educate our audience a little bit about we don't what's available to them what are their options and what to look out for is you mentioned these guys in Montana I got the wrong kind of seed and you gotta ensure that you've got some type of Co a some type of proof that you're what you're getting is exactly what it is because I don't walk our audience through kind of the different options for getting seeds you know clone starts and what's what they all are and kind of how that works all right I'll take a stab at it I mean it's all over the place right now and that's why it can be concerning for a consumer for a farmer to jump in because there's a lot of noise a lot of static out there in the market right now and you know I I started saying it last year you know we we were working with hdhd last year to get seeds to farmers we were kind of bombarded out of left field with the demand for feminized seed as we were gearing up for more clone sales last spring there were a lot of farms and a lot of groups looking for feminized seeds so we already had a relationship with HGH started sending some business their way they weren't you know prepared for the overwhelming demand at the market either so they didn't have enough seed - to meet all their demand we started working with a few other groups and seed providers almost all those backfired one way or another when we went outside of our HTH relationship and we had farmers that ended up not getting feminized seed that didn't get the genetics they wanted didn't get the germ rates they were promised you know we worked really hard in HGH came to bat for us to help make a lot of those deals right at the end of the day but those farmers had the seed and have the start that they needed but we made the decision right then like we're not going to keep it messing around with the genetics if we don't know exactly what we're working with and you know doing our due diligence and being where we are in the industry we knew that HTH was one of only a couple companies out there in the marketplace one of a handful that had trusted reliable seed that have been proven from coast to coast basically in every state that was growing hemp HGH had seeds planted and had compliant quality results at the end of the season the farmers could count on so we we became a partner with them and are doing quite a bit of production with them up in Oregon helping them keep up with the demand all over the all over the country and all over the world but that's that's kind of a summary of how we ended up there and why people need to be where is even even leads that come through trusted networks and you know established relationships these genetics are new so unless you're really working with a breeder and a company that has proven results year after year you don't really know where you're going to end up and you're going to be taking a pretty large financial risk and a lot of time and energy to take on a one-time shot each season at this harvest goal and if you come up short you can you can not only lose some of your investment but you lose a huge opportunity cost with where the market is right now and so you might you know some people are looking at save a couple bucks on the front end not realizing that that's you know potentially risking you know six figures on the back end we're talking to you know per acre costs potentially so it really is you know important to know who you're working with be able to vet them and you know follow their reputation they're certainly going to be new providers out there that season there's a lot of new feed companies and some of them are going to do really well but not all of them are and a lot of farmers are going to have to learn some tough lessons and face some tough losses as a result and I don't want to be a part of that our company didn't want to be a part of that and so that's what we're you know educating groups on and you know we're going to we're going to be sold out of seed so we're happy to talk with others about you know you know trusted in reputable brands out there there's another great group up in Oregon called Oregon CVD those guys are super trustworthy and bedded over the years but then you know there's not a lot of others on that list so it really puts farmers in a particular position of you know trying to go chase down one of the big companies like ourselves and get some seed or you know reach out to their own network and find out who's been who has actually worked with people and can vouch for them for hopefully more than one season go back you know two or three seasons and some of these states that have been around for a bit and that's what we're finding with genetics is it's really the the older states that have more established programs Colorado Origin Kentucky Tennessee Carolina those states have more roba networks and infrastructure of people that have been growing quality of genetics found out what is working well in their you know local regions and that you know help identify a successful path the last thing you want to be doing is risking your farm on you know a first-time clone producer a first-time seed producer or worse yet by some conceived it was accidentally created in the field last year that the farmers now trying to monetize so there's a lot of things out there to be aware of you know I've been saying for a while you know see is the new isolate if you've been paying attention to the CVD isolate market it's been crazy over the last two years that's putting it lightly there's a lot of nonsense a lot of BS and a lot of people that probably don't belong in deals trying to make deals happen and see it is going to go that same direction this year and there's going to be a lot of brokers a lot of middlemen a lot of people that are in this to make a short-term gain and bounce out and not be there in the long haul and be responsible and trustworthy to the farmer so yes that the long winded way if and you know be careful hundred percent you know I think John Europe yep John you were telling about a story in Oregon which there's a twenty million dollar lawsuit that's pretty crazy crazy if you want touch on that real quick yeah you know it's a UH some fellas it lately they they purchased about eighty six thousand dollars with the seed um it was a some varieties called special sauces in some s GMO strains they had and they were supposed to be feminized they lost a lot of money because the seeds were basically packed with pollen and needless to say they weren't feminized he resulted with some low performing flour it was worth $12 a pound instead of his expected $60 a pound he also he lost also off there were five is his inferior plants cross-pollinated and damaged nearby marijuana crops so it's definitely something a risk that you have to be aware of and what Mike said it's basically two words buyer beware make sure who you're dealing with is recommended great what they said and has kept referrals ask for referrals ask for testimonials from referrals if it's very important that you dig your [ __ ] 100% and so as this is scaling up you know we've seen clones being sold for $2 and $3 and $5 and $6 and everybody selling clones and you know some people are obviously selling seed that's a big market as well in the future this is going to change right now because it is kind of a boutique cottage industry is we're kind of evolving and clones can't be put in the ground but as the scales it's all going to go to seed at one point and even right now we're seeing the cost of seeds I'm $1 to $2 a seed when you're doing you know two thousand twenty-five hundred seeds per acre that adds up pretty quick and so over time you know we hope to see these prices go down get more affordable for farmers to get in how do you guys see this this clone business and the start business in the next five years you think it will all go to seed what do you think the ratio will be with that I can hop in there I think you know like I said last year we were gearing up for clone sales like we had in previous years and we're just bombarded with seed inquiries these days it's it's 9 out of 10 inquiries are for seeds or seed starts versus clones some new farmers are asking for clones and as soon as they get up to speed on seed availability and seed starts most of them you know sway their opinion that way for me you know this it's one thing to do clones for indoor cultivation marijuana size is breeding small scale but when we're talking hundreds thousands of acres it's really hard to create a cloning operation that can produce those produce healthy of you know stock keep pests and disease out of there and then when you factor in from a farmer's perspective trying to purchase and take possession of them you need to know where you are on that person's priority list I mean most of these corn facilities I know of are either trying to sell all the way up to their capacity or actually exceeding their capacity and crossing their fingers that they can produce more if anything goes wrong along their way their mother stock isn't growing fast enough they don't have enough sunlight it's cloudy for a week they get some sort of pass or dizzy pathogen or bug in there you know all these things are going to determine how healthier plants are and when you get them or if you get them at all you might not find out until June they it's not looking good for accordion operation we're going to be coming up short and then you're left scrambling at the last minute or you're sitting there on June 15th when they're supposed to be delivered and you find out that they're running a couple weeks behind schedule and then if they do get disease you know you show up with a bunch of plants that have disease that you may or may not know about and are dealing with that in the field the final point that kind of helps us distinguish between seeds inserts these have that that powerful tap root and doesn't make a difference in every region but in most regions having that stronger more vigorous plant that's going to go dig for water and nutrients results in a hardy or faster growing healthier plant I know that's not always the case but we have found that to be true you know often well as they look you know there's the breeders all over and there's cultivars being grown in so many different geographic regions and not all seed is created equal meaning they all can't grow in the same environment and so in this year in Arkansas in Alabama some of these southern regions high humidity pathogens and molds or just ramp it down there I mean it's hard to get away from a lots or lots and lots of rain you know so it's really important to to really find cultivars that are going to work well areas and it's going to be a kind of a trial and error some of these farmers they're going to have some success I don't think they're gonna have a 100% success because the project we're working on we will be you know doing a lot of trials on a lot of different varieties to see what's going to work in the hot humid areas the pests are out of control a lot of these areas and so it's going to be very important to you know work with breeders very closely see what variety is going to work in these regions because a lot of these seed portfolios eat breeders have not all of them you know will work and so make sure you you you ask the right questions you work with them to tell them what you're trying to achieve and if you are doing a pilot program for the first time in a new geographic region do your home or try many different varieties to see what's going to work for you except snot you know you've got that work you're going to not find the right buddy that works for you you can have uphill battle the next year so okay so how do as we look at kind of you know the industry these these these these farmers are growing they've got this up in the field I want to kind of jump down to kind of the technology aspect of this industry and John this kind of leads into kind of some of your background a specialty and one of the things you've really taken on is this is not just now planting you know a few plants outside and watching them grow this is now looking at acreage large scale and it can't all be done by hand and so even with putting seed in the ground what are some of the ways that you've seen the seed get into the ground I love to hear Mike and John both perspective on this and kind of we're going to work our way through this process of getting seed in the ground prepping the soil understanding how the best way is to plant it with the spacing all the way through the maintenance of it through the season and then obviously how do we get out of the field and do with it after that so it's going to start with the first part of you know prepping the soil understanding that perspective and how do you get the damn seed in the ground and what technology are we using I'm sure I'll make the first first thing you need to do is with any any crop being grown this tester so long know what you're dealing with there can be some heavy metals in the ground that we pulled in as a his campus a bio accumulator and retaining me within the plant but from a standpoint of what you behalf what you know your soil is good from a from a cleanliness perspective a lot of the traditional farming row crop farming equipment will work for a pre plant tillage things like sub solutely roll-aboard plows discs to basically work the tillage I work the ground up so that it provides a good seedbed after that it really depends on what you're growing the crop for what what segments is it fiber is it alone it's a boil you're most likely going to use a raised vegetable SuperBetter and lay down plastic mulch is one of the ways it's currently been grown however that's uh that's quite a large task when you're talking about doing large acreage laying down plastic it's not exactly a rapid process although it says in comparison of what traditional farmers are used to and planning on a broadcast basis like you would for a profile and grain in that case you might use a narrow row drill a 5-inch drill you might even broadcast from the back of a bud fertilizer value and then bisque the diff to see then of course that's going to be all most softly active we see seed costs come back in because is LS alluded to the capex of of planning the seed cost is if somewhat prohibitive cost prohibitive for large acreage in that broadcast planning method okay and then as far as just all pressed I mean you know building things up in rows it's just very very traditional to how it almost grow strawberries and in the field what do you seeing as far as you know using those tools to get the you know that type of stage setup for planting well the years of years of raised bed raised dad betters and shapers which is traditional in me as you said the strawberry market is already industry the a lot of these vegetable industries where they do use a classic mulch to provide weed control and then they come back in with a some type of transplant or planner and poke holes in me and the plastic and them either transplanting clone straws or seed into the into the ground their enzyme is a rate that laetrile hold the beds so it's important to know that in that in that application that are lay down drip lines within the underneath the plastic so that they can provide irrigation and nutrients through the drip line during their getting the groceries Mike what kind of spacing you recommend with the with you with the seeds you guys use what's your normal kind of acreage and spacing per plant that you're going to recommend you know I'd say if there was a standard right now would be around a five by five spacing but there really isn't a standard right now and when it comes to irrigation when it comes to planting density when it comes to harvesting you name it people are trying it and so when it comes to getting it into the field when it comes to urinating when it comes to pulling it out there isn't a perfect system yet it's really trying to figure out what your end goal is what your plan is at the end of the season and then start working backwards if you have to ask me and you know that more acreage you have the tougher that harvest is going to be the tougher that drying is going to be in so it's really about how can you get in there and get it out of the field most efficiently into your drying situation and then once you know that that path you can kind of work backwards and say if you know we're going to get it out of the ground this way we've done it this type of irrigation available on our property our planning density should probably be something around this based on when we're getting it in the ground you know similar to the the indoor variables that you and I know there's a lot of different things that you can do in a twenty by twenty grow room or a 200 by 200 grow room the same thing applies out in the field and so there's you know I know guys that are doing as few as twelve hundred and fifty plants an acre we know people growing those same varieties at almost 5,000 plants an acre we've got some auto flower varieties that are a lot smaller that we tell people you know ten thousand acres the recommended planning that we'll be in so each one of those is going to have its own set of variables when it comes to how you're going to irrigate it how you're going to get out of the field sometimes farmers don't have you know options a lot of times you know this is what they have for water how do you make the most of this this is what they have for implementation you get it in the ground how do we utilize that how do you how do you make the most of this opportunity without going out and buying a whole bunch of new equipment or a whole lot of new infrastructure for your property I always you know to do so and you know that's what I'm more interested in helping farmers do is utilize existing infrastructure then try and reinvent the wheel yes and then so we control I mean I know this is kind of one of the biggest parts here we hate to use pesticides and spray things or in the field I know we've looked at different types of mulching biodegradable mulching shading from the plant to help do this even cover crops what's works what's what has been proven I know it's a pain in the butt to pull plastic up every year out of the field that's no fun that's an extra cost to add in I like the bottle gradable ones but even the shading that's even a lower budget cost approach what do you see is been working with you know what is that are we still is trial and error trying to figure else I think we're still trial-and-error because all those things you mentioned are working and there's pros and cons each of them and you know I think it's rare that I see a farmer that does something and then says they're going to do it exactly the same the following you know most of these guys are tweaking and optimizing and improving each time I I see a future where you know you're there's dense planning and that's suppressing the weeds and we're we're not trying to grow it as much of a row crop as it is a full canopy probably smaller plants where you can come in and take the whole plant down and not have too much wood out there have it be more that the fleshy soft material that can go into processing and that's where I'm seeing the most excessive farmers particularly up in the northwest guys that are going towards higher density higher planting density smaller plants you know even canopy and then being able to come in there mechanically and get those plants out of the ground real easily I need to they're drying whatever that's going to be all right with with that kind of being said let's lead into how the hell do you get this out of the ground you know john has been telling me stories about these large coal mines gone in the fields and get clogged up and it's taken five days to get them on clogged up because it's so fibrous and what are what what's being used what what has been proven because it's hard to go out and do this by hand is just you need an army of people and laborers and it's just not cost-effective so what's working how are they getting this out of the field John do you want to do it and talk about some of the equipment there yeah you know there's I think it meant comes back into what Mike said there's a lot of different things that are being used there's everything being used from a full plant cutting and then hanging like them like it has been done in the tobacco industry all the way to combines that you know it did that for like CBD oil production where you're cutting the whole plant down at one for drawing pre-production I learned what you're going for of fiber and grain you have the opportunity to use combines and more mechanical mechanical rip harvesting things like a there's a machine called MC 15 it's been made in Belgium which allows simultaneous cutting of tops for grain and at the same time the bottom shatters cuts the rest of the stock it conditions the stalk and it wind drums the stock for later can be bailed for the removal of the field from the field to the processing plant for things like livestock feed supplement so there's a lot of different types of harvesting equipment that's out there and I think that it's still at a point where we're figuring out what the best methods are I can't wait for big AG and when I say big bag I'm talking about John Deere and Caterpillar to get involved because there's a lot of them Bob the company so far have not really not really seen what I think they can bring to the table and provide you know equipment that's able to harvest thousands of thousands of acres in a single season ok and so the nice thing it farther ahead but not going to do this John Deere has some implements that they're going to be introducing soon and I think all of these companies are paying attention and and trying to help figure it out right now I think part of the problem is that farmers in the industry haven't necessarily told them what the standard is going to be at or what these plants are going to look like you know like I said there's some guys that are growing 2 foot 3 foot plants you know 5,000 an acre there's guys in Southern Oregon that are growing you know huge plants still at a much lower density per acre and all those have have different harvesting demands and bigger the plants and more fiber in that stock and the more likely you're going to run into that issue that you mentioned in filled John we're equipments getting jammed up we can't deal with the plant can't handle that fibrous stalks so there's really a balance of you know trying to find out you know what that that common ground is between how the farmers can produce that at a affordable cost per acre and then get in there with the right equipment that's still being developed and perfected I get it out of the field but you name it they're trying there right now we'll learn a lot more this season I'm sure that's what's so damn exciting about this is there's no true playbook yet we're still finding our way there's a lot of great minds kind of attacking this to figure this out and resolve it and over time we'll really get this refined and so so so these farmers got us out of the field and you know there's there's all aspects of drying it getting it ready to go for processing and so even some of the drying techniques are still a little archaic or we go from the binder way I'm reverting back to my experience working in Humboldt County and drying product in the middle of nowhere with no power and you're seeing this quite a bit with him still today using these be big pull barns and lean tools and lots of large fans keeping them dark and just being able to get air through the space and over the plants to prevent mold and mildew so that it can be packaged up to go to market for extraction and so who's buying this how do the farmers get tied into the supply and demand side of this if these guys are just growing it for biomass to sell how do these farmers connect and how do we help give these guys an outlet understand that they want to get into this game where can they find good contracts and relationships for that that aspect to take that product off their hands I'm happy to jump in on that I just want to touch on drawing real quick because sure a lot of people are hang drying and air drying that is is simply not scalable with this acreage agreed and so we are seeing a lot of new options hit the market a lot of new equipment to help drive stuff we're seeing tools that were used for hops drying and other agricultural goods being repurposed over the hem foot is going to be a huge bottleneck this year with the increase of acreage growing up you know 10x we did not we maybe saw it 2x increase in drying capacity so that's going to be a huge bottleneck and I encourage all farmers to think about that at a time and not wait till the end of the season to figure out how they're going to dry this stuff assume it's going to be raining when you dry it and you'll you'll be in a better position come that time of year so just think about that for farmers and then going into you know supply and demand let's assume you got this stuff dried and now it's time to hit the market a lot of farmers are looking to land contracts at a time as they do in other industries and right now we're not really at a point in stable marketplace with him for a lot of futures contracts are being written the ones that are typically being written to companies that already have a working relationship together not a first time farmer or a new relationship so a lot of this is a little bit of you know risk reward and rolling the dice to get that at higher valuation right now I mean we've worked with farmers that you know make $250,000 in acre this past year and while that's certainly not going to last there's certainly room for a lot of compression there and for this still to be one of the more lucrative crops on a per acre basis but the more the more certainty you want in that sale the more upside I think you have to give up so farmers that are interested in locking in a buyer today are most likely going to have to play you know to their needs and they're probably not going to be offering you a very high amount you're going to give up a lot of that upside if you stuck around and play the market held out for you know when the market might dip back up there are some groups that are willing to you know make arrangements ahead of time there are processors that might be willing to do splits but finding that path to market is that million-dollar question quite literally and so there isn't you know a go to an easy solution a guarantee that I know of I mean our business has been filled and being being in that brokering position connecting the dots on the industry finding out where the supply needs are where the demand needs are and matching them up but as the thing scales and you know let's say we do get 500,000 acres to the finish line that's a lot of hemp that's going to hit the market all around the same time you know it's going to be quite quite the circus out there and if you're looking to recoup your money right when you bring your crop down and tap into the open market you're probably not going to get top dollar if I had to listen to my gut I don't think that we're going to grow enough hemp next year to meet the global demand for American product and so I do think that if farmers hold onto their crop and waited out a little bit and get past that huge influx after harvest that there will be a strong market but you know you know we've still got those variables we've still got the FDA you know lingering out there that could potentially change the supply chain dynamics you've got other global markets I mean unlike marijuana this is this is a global market now but we have to take into account Canada South America Mexico Europe Australia Asia you know China is coming on and the kind is always led not always but it's been leading hemp acreage for a while now well they're ramping up CBD and minor cannabinoids production - so the world's going to feel that right now that we don't know how that's going to affect the US market if USDA and FDA are going to have our backs and protect the farmers and protect the supply chain if they're going to allow a big influx of you know global CVD to penetrate our market who knows but I do believe this you know firmly in the American market in the American farmer I know that we've got you know the best genetics we've got processing facilities and infrastructure that's scaling up really fast really efficiently so we're going to be in a really good position but it's not going to last forever you know on farmers need to be aware of that that this might be a short term window of a few seasons while the getting's real good and you know they have to make that decision of where they want to live if they want to play the market go for the most upside do they want to take a reasonable contract and shoot for more of a long term relationship or some combination or space in between there but unfortunately no guarantees right now in the market but you you can go ask you know farmers that have been growing hemp last year for a few years how they've been doing and you know if they're willing to tell you they're probably going to share some some interesting stories and some significant games with there I'm glad you broke that down for our audience to go this is one of the big things that one all these farmers understand it it's not that gets rich quick thing when all this product comes the market is everybody coming at once having those relationships for distribution is going to be key and so it's it's still there's no 100% guarantee here so I'm glad you really explained that guys I'm we're kind of running out of time here we got about four or five minutes left I want to kind of dive into some of our questions from our audience before I do that is there anything else you want to kind of touch on just to kind of wrap this up on our end before we dive into Q&A here I would I'm good on by Alan right John I just want to point out something that most every farmer I speak to ask about and that's crop insurance is that crop insurance available yet most people will tell you know there is some limited underwriters that will insure cannabis and as well as HAMP outdoor crops so that they said it's a big concern performance good yep one other thing I want to do address real quick ellis is when we were talking about THC earlier there's some discrepancies on a national level of what's being measured for THC and it's just something that farmers should be aware of when you're talking about GAC you've got you got various forms of the prominent two are the Delta 9 THC which is the THC that that gets you high gets intoxicated and then there's THC a the acid form in the plant and that's typically what's fine that found in much higher when it's when it's on the plan hasn't been heated or decarboxylated some studies are saying that it's the total THC so it it's those two combined with a little bit of calculation for loss some states are saying it's only Delta 9 THC and so it's put you know States and farmers and consumers in an interesting predicament where it might be legal in one state you cross over to a state line it could be perceived as illegal what's compliant on a federal scale versus what's compliant on a state state level and I'm not seeing one side is right or wrong I'm just saying that there is discrepancy there and it's something for farmers to be aware of when they're shopping for genetics and thinking about where their end consumer is going to be okay that's great input as well one thing we did really get to touch on the day and you guys okay to go over a few minutes and then this that like by up after the hour you guys okay with that I wanted to make sure we can touch on some of these points here make sure we give our audience but you guys have to color quit okay cool so make sure we can kind of cool we have adjust on the extraction side yet as we know we thoughts about you know obviously having that supply chain understood but let's talk about these the the end products with the isolate but just a little what you know what are the different uses and why you know so many different uses for it and and just the whole extraction side of it I see it very fragmented I see so many extractors now coming into the CBD space in Colorado and now getting set up all over the the US and so how do you see this kind of coming into play now as well it's a great question and like so many of the other ones we've touched on there's a can of worms when you try and answer it but there's you name it right now with the extraction people are trying to do it with hemp when you look at marijuana extraction versus hemp hemp is just there's so much more volume so we've had to take everything that was developed on there's a kid in the marijuana side of cannabis combine it with industrial extraction that's happening in China and other parts of the world and other industries and form some you know create some new equipment new technology new techniques that we can process you know thousands to tens of thousands of pounds a day versus you know 10 to 20 to 100 pounds a day in so ethanol co2 hydrocarbons like propane and butane oils like MCT oil water heat steam you know all these things all these methods are being utilized in different capacities to extract I think ethanol is one of the cheapest did more efficient for people to get into it also leaves you with probably one of the more you know truly crude forms of extract you know most of these processes co2 ethanol hydrocarbon is going into post extraction refinement where that crude oil is being maybe winterized decarboxylated distilled maybe people are taking distillate and removing the THC they either get it complying or get a KC free distillate can then be refined into isolate so there's there's an um a lot of different paths to get to any one of those final products and what's happening right now is that in my opinion there's there's a lot of room on the margin side that a lot of these new facilities that you're talking about that are coming online aren't very efficient you know they might be able to make a lot of money right now but as this whole market compresses and efficiencies become critical I think we're going to see a lot of those extractors fall out and not be able to keep up and you know that's going to give a lot of room for really efficient processing techniques material handling is a big piece of this I tell farmers and processors you're not really in the hemp industry as much as you're in the material handling industry when it comes to getting the product out of the field getting it dry getting it store getting it into extraction getting it out of extraction it's just it's a lot of material to move around and so that's where a lot of costs are incurred along the way and so the people that start to attack that whole picture from out of the field to an ingredient form and when I say ingredient form it's that crude oil that distillate that when your eyes that I select how do you get it get that whole thing handled with as few people as possible as little equipment as little manpower so that you can truly have a consistent facility that's taken material inside and spitting it out the other trucks dropping off biomass trucks taking you know pelleted or you know post-process material out of the facility that's going to be the critical component that's what I'm really excited to see unfold are some of these you know true processing facilities that aren't just somebody taking you know a bag of hemp dumping it into a machine and then coming back four hours later emptying that machine and reloading it in doing that every day day in day out I think there's going to be people that lead the way where you know a truck really you know drops it off on one end and you know equipment brings it through the facility and takes it through every step of the process fitting out oil on one side and post-processed hemp hopefully in another usable form pelletized for you know burning in in wood stoves or animal feed for cattle or livestock horses that sort of thing but that's where I see the future of this thing and so as those efficiencies become critical and people you know this whole market compresses dramatically I think that's where the winners are going to come out of extraction great answer John you wanna add anything on that I think you pretty much covered it soup to nuts that's a great machination perfect all right guys I'm going to wrap this up here by trying to plow through some of these questions we've got a handful of them I won't be able to get to all of them to our audience I will say to our audience members I did answer to you the questions through this Q&A as well so you can go back and listen or see them but just kind of rock into this real quick when gentleman's asking where can you find a processor in cultivator in Massachusetts I tell them to get online and look at your state's website for hemp applicants who've been awarded the license and those will tell you directly who will be in the space is that right guys yes it's a little bit different depending on the state but I think that's a good starting point and then you know Google Google's your friend right now network and you go to your local event or if you don't have a local event start a local event you'll meet a lot of great people in your area as a result okay here's another question do we do you have any state or federal compliances or any resources we can recommend it will be good for these folks every state's going to be a little bit different I talked to your Department of Ag if it's not on their website easy to find most of them pick up the phone after a couple rings every Department of Ag I've ever worked with seems to have the best interest at our farm we're at art and is usually a plethora of information yeah that's good too directly right see if your local state plant more it's going to be your friend okay perfect I know John you work with them quite a bit so here's another question are there any other methods to harvest large plants besides cutting hole and hanging dry I think John touched on a few of those but do any other options yeah you know it's a little bit it's what John mentioned and it's you know kind of working with what you got I don't know if he wants to go out and buy an expensive new piece of equipment if you want to try and retrofit something if there's still time to plan your field out to make harvesting easier find out you know if there's any other local farms in your area of people in the hemp industry that might have equipment that could be utilized for both your properties or for a number of farms in the region but I think that's critical right now is not every farm is going to be able to afford all the equipment and so a lot of it is about sharing resources finding those other people in your community that are trying to do something similar or have that piece of equipment sitting stagnant in their field from another project that might be able to be repurposed again great all right I got another question here and I've got me into all this this morning and you may have some recommendations as well but they're asking for a small scale down mobile decor Decatur for purchase or lease they're interested in some hip stocks and doing textile in LA and this morning I was actually looking at a there's a polish him expose iam going on in Maine and there's a gentleman there by the name of Chris tops has you spell at Kri staps his last name is eg Li T is and he's a developer of a micro hip to tour Decatur so for that person look at this gentleman here he's out of Latvia JA John or Mike you guys know any of these little things that may be useful in viable and accessible here in the US I don't know of a small mobile one off the top my head one other thing that we that last comment you just made made me think of is there's an amazing event here at the end of March in two weeks in Denver called Naoko hemp Expo as far as I know it's the largest most established hemp expo in the world and it brings people from all over the world all over the country most the experts are going to be there there's going to be a lot of new equipment to check out there's going to be a lot of new techniques there's gonna be a lot of shared knowledge if you're if you're diving into hemp this year and have a bunch of questions there's no better place to be March 29th and 30th than Naoko in Denver Colorado so there's no point for those guys ok also I've got one real quick a gentleman out of New Jersey is asking how many plants per acre with it earlier about a 5x5 footprint anywhere from about 1800 or 2500 plants you're seen depending on cultivar Mike mentioned you can see up to 10,000 if using these Otto flowers and so yeah any comments on planting four acre for this guy in Jersey big big questionnaires not only your spacing but when you're putting them in the ground you know that plants going to be a whole lot different if it goes in the ground during seven then July 7 so that's spacing and yield play a much bigger role when you combine them with timing than just looking at you know the genetics on their own or the spacing on their own perfect there's a question here says what types of challenges have you seen in the North East any types of genetic profiles or specific genetics that have success stories specifically in the math area I'd recommend reaching out to one of the seed breeders you can call us here at ACC we can kind of walk you through the different varieties we know they can work in that environment as well as reach out to Michael Diego as he can also give that information I'm sure - that would probably work well in your environment absolutely yeah we've got some rare I'm doing great up North East perfect so if you would reach out to Mike and he can definitely walk you down that here's another quick question can you use a sprinkler system I have the big wheel total around with a tractor I think you can water and get water to your plans ever you like right you mean it's yes sir okay all right I'm going to wrap this up guys as we're going over about five minutes already is ten Apter there's still a handful of questions up but I think most of these were touched on during our talk but guys just want to thank you for getting on the day we could talk for hours about this it's great to connect any last leaving comments you want to make Mike know you know I'm happy to be here and I wish all hemp growers a really fantastic season don't hesitate to reach out questions use us as a resource that's what we're here for awesome and then John do you have any comics you want to mimic here to kind of wrap this up yeah I just tell everyone thank you for helping to push the ball down the field this is a great opportunity for our full growers and farmers around the country but as Mike and Nellis alluded to I do your homework and we're here to help you if you need all right well I want to thank our audience today for joining to speak with Michael you go from IMX planting season is approaching are you ready I want to thank John for getting all from ACC and just our audience in general for getting on and last and final I respond Cannabis text for hosting this today for us could do this without you really appreciate audience getting on and we look forward to hearing you on our next webcast thanks again everybody have a great day appreciate your time", "4MWYIU2Kfp4": "while hemp products have been gaining a following in Montana and today producers and processors came together to talk about the changes in the hemp industry MTN's Jennifer Houseman has more from seeds to oil to fiber there are a number of uses for hemp montana farmers union held a meeting Tuesday for producers and processors of hemp products to come together along with a number of presentations the event allowed different businesses to discuss the constantly expanding industry of hemp Kerry Kolstad a fifth generation farmer started with Montana's pilot program in 2016 to start growing industrial hemp but he hopes the industry continues to grow in Montana what I'd like to see is something happen with the fiber I'd like to see Montana bring in some processing plants and start utilizing that because that's where the most most of the uses from hemp actually come from the stock and no one's really using it Morgan Elliott IND hemp VP of Operations shared with me some of what they will be doing at IND located in Fort Benton and you know we produce wholesale products to do wholesale oil and wholesale protein and so you know our finished product is going into salad dressings or topical treatments as well as protein bars or protein shakes and so hemp products have typically been associated with marijuana and that just isn't the case anymore Eliot says it's important to make sure people are aware of just how much can be done with hemp so advocacy is a big part of our job getting the the information out there that this you know commodity plant is available and that you can have it in your household the Montana farmers union has plans to host more of these types of events in the future to help increase awareness and have farmers share their information that they have about the hemp industry in Montana there's a lot to learn I'm still learning even after growing it for three years in Great Falls Jennifer Houseman MTN news MTN also spoke with organizers of the events and will have more details on that tomorrow in our Montana AG report tomorrow night at 10:00", "YANxK3ZcFng": "back at Clinton farm sometimes electric farms and I'm here to show you that we've hit the flowering stages here at Clinton farms and we are going to be making some wonderful and/or flower and not just a little but a lot and this is aquaponics so we are using a great sustainable method in the form of Agriculture to cultivate this cannabis crop here he's got ten strains and we've got a lot of variety they're very bushy - tall leggy and I can't wait to show you let's give you a good view of acquitting farms into flowering stages so temperature is 69 degrees in here relative humidity 62 and the co2 right now is 410 so looks like co2 is a little low humidities a little bit high temperatures that's pretty good but they make adjustments and everything changes just instantly he's got good environmental controls here at Quintin farms and that makes a difference since we're in the first two weeks of flowering we're going to be able to see at each one of these nodes there's going to be a calyx that holds two pistols or it's going to be stamina so it's salmon bearing which is a male and it's pistol bearing if it's female and you're going to be able to see that right there see a lot of plants here at Clinton farms [Music] [Music] take a look at the roots in this bed here large root systems as you can see stocks are quite [Music] [Music] we're still at Quentin Farms well we're at another location that they have and this is a grodan this is a building where they've got around a thousand plants that are growing out and as you can see these are flood and drain tables so pretty nice pretty excited to show you guys all of the plants that they're growing cultivating and I think it's going to be a great year also they got some prey of Madison here I'm going to show you some praying mantis as well his root systems look great I've got to get this guy praying mantis my guy is ready to attack you're

the bat the bat like okay that's like five times already this is some fire man some fire chem dog boy breath just the fact that they got the [ __ ] I don't have it in the case yeah to ask so when I ordered it it came like this right straight for me shout ease ease if you guys want to sponsor this man let us know let us know down below yeah it really just came like this this box right here so clean huh I should have bought the second mixtape classic X chem dog for what about oh we just opened it over like gonna smoke that joint gonna smoke a blunt and we open that shadow to have a mixtape in there yeah but the packaging is [ __ ] sick I've actually never bought anything like this like where it just comes in like in a little package and [ __ ] yours actually looks like 3.5 grams mine yesterday it didn't easily I should complain huh damn this tastes good dad because love you guys ass Marcus up did sparking it join the sash that's some good [ __ ] man ease does not disappoint never do what do you thing about that [ __ ] bro did it take this firehouse on fire 6x I'm not surprised this can fire you know it's a pricey as a traitor Nina sweet is not nostalgic because like it's kind of this age when we went when we first started smoking you know I back and it's have a good he'll like something kids would smoke you know how we're just smoking kicking this money powerful start book definitely I miss my strength like this the chem dog the og the the Girl Scout you know like okay I'll throw back and stuff I wish I'd like a throwback series where we smoke like maybe like a throwback stranger go back Thursday's throwback Thursdays that'd be sick maybe even on Thursdays we can start uploading like you know stories and show you I will smoke like an OG s you know I don't want to smoke some pipes again yeah herbs oh oh yeah perks for fire back then like that's what I that's what I started smoking so I started smoking with my cousin like back in high school in shape her and he'd always have perps or his connect would always have perps you know he would live in the valley and [ __ ] and it would be purple you buy like wow yeah well they would say is hella good or some green grapes oh I remember that some green crack but that crack in your crack what else there's so many strains we tried it's funny it's like damn imagine we we were able to record all the sessions you know we were able to do it you know what we should do bro have a jar every time I come every time you come we'll link up drop a nug in there and we'll fill it up and we'll roll a fat ass more than just different strains every time we could just record that is some fire see so again a little bit about this tree it's an indica dominant dominant so it's a hybrid how much the indica dominant [ __ ] 25 percent THC and zero CBD I've noticed it started to add a lot of CBD CBD you know you guys don't know I do have a chest injury it's not like two years ago I saw my chest at the gym and ever since then bro like it just doesn't feel right you know something I try to work it out and I should kind of aches my dumb ass fall it didn't really like I stood I stood and all that stuff but I didn't go to like the doctor because I thought it was just like a hold like a nerve or some [ __ ] yeah but uh so sometimes you know I gotta burn for the pain and [ __ ] you know definitely camped out for is a fire a straight man right now I am [ __ ] lit we're only like the bro that's the beginning with the joint bro terminator my friends just be like good like 5 minutes 10 minutes and it's still going bro [ __ ] man that cam dog is some some loudness man it is it's some guys some guys huh just gotta make sure the cameras are hey but it's crazy I'm looking at this camera bro this cameras pretty lit and the bullet is on point it's just the other one is about a lot more complex if that makes sense in it's a little complex and [ __ ] that make sense now this one there's a lot smoother like the g7x you can actually see yourself yeah there's a billion and this is this is the first one to I'm trying to sell this one and get the second one imagine cycling the same the quality was just probably just a 1 so [ __ ] makes you guys drop a like though let's not mean what you guys cuz right there man y'all take it take it so you sure not like y'all can't even [ __ ] stays on your face [Music] Oh blow he's not disappoint bros there ain't nothin but the thing is like the tree is on point and it's a fire but it is a little bit pricey you know you know like for this he gets like a 40-yard eight but I thought you got to deliver to your house and it's in fire but you know that's tag so that's tax and we also offer instagrams on our twitter is down below so if you guys want to hit us with the follow you know hey just what to follow but that's text uh-huh $40 for an eight yeah bro it might even mean $40 because I remember this one I seen the chem dog before before yeah it was on it was on sale pretty much those like I sell before the sell I seen that it was like $39 so $39 he's starting to do the delivery and the taxes yeah there's still that's gonna be leggy almost as close so $50 a dance we're just being real with you guys man but usually with the front yeah it's worth it you know one you know got a drive through the club it comes to you so it's ready to go and it's some fire does not disappoint so if you guys have the cash man then too you don't have to deal with them shady as neither's that'd be skimming you yeah no that's your five point at the little baby blue cute little baby later it's on fire I wouldn't show the light I was like this - look at my hand I had nothing once okay I she's fired we should we should also react to something like funny house videos or some [ __ ] on them down some head laughs fine I imagine doing like a [ __ ] scared video tonight we can have a label you guys watch some scary [ __ ] have a question for everybody that's funny though because all the videos that I'm uploading this I guess but you know later on there's gonna be coming to shame I have a light switch coming in right now talking it into existence because you know the universe works that way whatever you thinking in mine whatever is in your head is your reality so I said yeah our mind is like our conscious and our subconscious denied everything up here it's connected to the universe yeah we just don't do it oh how to control it that's why they say man you just gotta think positive and work hard every day because we were good we're good Italy hey which one is this one other relax you guys watch it in our previous video so again make sure you hit that subscribe button cuz and let us know in the comments on below if you guys want to see anything because we are gonna be doing the loud challenge we're gonna be doing the loud challenge and then we're gonna be reviewing a shitload of trees you wanna head oh that's all the relax yeah always I'm gonna try this one too the Viper is can I double hit it yeah is it on the bill up Dan that tastes like relax and my bleep it's actually they're forbidden free so they got the bad boy cam down huh Dan it's some fire bro cam dog for I should say fire look at that yeah I switch the camera too god damn let me know what quality looks better then this will look better or the other one I think this one does this is the 4k when it's up front it's always a 4k when it's from like a side or anything it's like the g7x yeah that's actually taste good no real what maybe it's just depending it has to be different oh shut up damn low Fang it makes you guys watch this last but the previous videos we uploaded you know yeah let us know if you guys watched a game of Game of Thrones or Avengers endgame oh yeah I still need to watch your fingers in game see I got it spoiled to me you already watched it huh yep it's only someone just came on to me like a [ __ ] there wasn't a my red eyes was like god dammit does that even true though you can't believe that I can't believe what she well believe it you know just that you guys know we are gonna be dropping some merge some in the cub merge you know can you see like a hat like this and it just says indica and because I was a sick-ass fall if that makes her so let us know man say we just started this brand / channel so we're gonna cut it we're gonna get a poppin guys it's [ __ ] been like a good a solid 30 45 minutes 3045 minutes as long as this video a little longer than this video cuz usually when I edit I kind of cut some parts out but uh we're just looking for a minute so the joint damn lastly no huh so fat well I am [ __ ] loaded I'm nice loaded cam dock for man loaded and blow this [ __ ] is some fire sob arrow straight young people and like always

years I'm getting kind of bored so I decided to change it up and what better place to go then cannabis the Green Rush all the excitement there's only one problem I don't know anything about it so come along with me as we learn about cannabis together [Music] [Music] [Music] we're at the kind buds farm in a fellow Washington where we're gonna learn from Frank everything we need to know about cannabis [Music] hey Frank what are you doing over here well we're filling up these pots with soil so that we can transplant our girls into their final resting place for the season when we came in we saw this great big mound of dirt what's all that about yeah we just got that delivered in from Canada and it's what we're filling all these pots with it's a very porous soilless mixture so that it's really good for the root zone so we're getting all these 50 gallon grow bags filled so that we can transplant our other plants into their final resting place for the season so there's a special quality about this dirt or bug free or yes it's very very clean very sterile clean very professional business and they bring some excellent excellent soil it's peat peat moss and perlite and there's really no dirt in there so it's just a good neutral real porous so they get a lots of oxygen and so using this special soil you can control the nutrients better yes exactly because we're not putting it in the soil and hoping that we've done the right mix and make a bio available at the roots we're putting a very neutral soil and then we're adding it when we water them we're just adding our nutrients to it so we have complete control over what it gets throughout its whole life is this a common way to grow marijuana outdoors yes I'm gonna thought people put it in the ground well it depends on your soil and the soil out here is real agricultural so it's good for a lot of agricultural crops but it's real sandy not very porous it also has a lot of parasites in it that we just don't want to deal they're clients so it is pretty common outdoor growers even on the California they didn't put him in the ground they put him in the ground they were just digging a hole putting their soil in there and probably would have been happy to do that except for the parasites that are in the soil here that we don't want to have to use any massive pesticides or anything to control anything so or controlling the soil is that right there's plastic on the ground that and help keep dust down and help keep these weeds that you see or her fair ubiquitous around here out from away from our plants yes excellent thanks Frank since I'm investing in the farm would you like me to get my hands dirty absolutely we can always use help out here I better not break a nail no I'm fine until I start complaining about it right and you'd be like I told you oh you want me to help you [Music] and I kind of swing it into there I just you want to try to pull it I think I can I think I can that's how hard okay haven't gotten to the hill yet [Music] we'll move it after we move the car pull that car forward for me that'll go down don't worry about it run right over [Music] what's next well now we got to get the water lines in the water emitters in so that we put the plants in we can give them some water I said a more efficient way of watering them than just oh yeah hand water in just this many plants that would just take forever I'd have a watering system so that's what Mike and I are going to get going on now so first you want to make sure the pot is situated and sometimes they get a little jumbled kind of flat and yeah dig out a hole big nice and flat then you come over here first just quickly go from the bottom here and just kind of pull off in either the brown leaves don't get too concerned about it will do that plenty more you can even get the ones out of there and then you just take that bag rip it open all the way down to the bottom it's heavy man you kind of ruffle the bottom a little bit [Music] one two so it's like a full terms like two efforts see I'm sir just put your fingers on either side one pull around yeah and then put it pretty close off the center there but you don't want to just shove it right there then you might get here if you feel big pressure from roots stop mm-hmm and then just put that in there about an inch up okay move on all right let you do that one whole little dead pieces what are we planting here Frank what strain is this this is OG k v7 and I do not know what that stats a hold it just buy that stock like that it's not hey Frank what's with all the security cameras well marijuana is a pretty valuable crop so we got to protect it plus the state mandates it not just not just cameras so that we can catch anybody breaking in and stealing but also so that they can keep an eye on what we're doing and they can always come and request footage if they have to suspect that maybe we've done some kind of violation of the laws so it's mandated but it's also a good practice because we want to protect our my crop have you ever had anything stolen not from here no this one's wet okay little girl oh girl yeah and why is it important that they're all girls because if we have males in here they would pollinate the females and then they females are developed seeds and we don't nobody wants seeds in there bleed I don't want seeds in my weed so this is the dosatron that's actually what it's called I don't know if you can hear it as well as I can but it's got a nice beat and you can dance to it hey Frank what's behind me this is our storage connects and processing facility climate control is where we keep our product in the pristine condition until we actually package it and send it off to the retail stores so in plain English that's where the good stuff is let's go check it out so here we have air conditioning and humidifier or dehumidifier so that we can maintain it below 75 degrees and keep the humidity around 50 percent is that important for the storage yeah that keeps the product in pristine condition doesn't get too dried out it does it's not too moist where it will start the mold so you keep it right at that perfect spot so it doesn't get too dry and it'll be perfect when you smoke it what's this thing this is the green rose trimmer it's a trimming machine you put the bud in there spins around and comes out mostly trying to sell not a good hand trim but yeah there's no perfect machine solution yet for trim when it does come is going to be into the industry because labor and that hand tremors it's a real bottleneck in the industry because that Americans really like that hand trimmed flower like in Israel you know they have the government medical program and the government does all the growing and they only way you can purchase cannabis is either an oil and a hash farm or in a joint if you want flour you guys smoke a joint cuz they're not going to process it and trim it all the way down they just grind up and make the joint out of it so but but the American consumers so used to hand trimmed perfect little flower they've not settling for anything less so what you have to do it what are these boxes for a frame well this is where we're storing all our products for example this is some product harvested from last year that we haven't quite a process yet so we leave it on the stem in the climate-controlled environment until we can get to the final stages of processing and trimming it as you can see it still got it holds its shape so it's not too dried out and it's a good way to store it leaving it on the stem if y'all can get to it to get it all trimmed up it's just easier for it to dry out so some of these bins have the trim in them some of them have our lotta deflower already we have just the old just this is what we call rough trim that ones so that's just stuff that's gonna go to an extractor and be just turned into oil and this is the stuff that comes off in the machine no this isn't even from the machine this is just stuff like when we're harvesting just all this stuff but and it's it's no great glass material but still got value so you said this is various products what is of the approximate value of what you have in here I think I've estimated it quarter million and before marijuana was legal in the state of Washington what would this have been worth street value approximately [Music] double that bus without any taxes the difficulty that farmers like Frank face trying to raise funds in order to grow the size of their business really emphasizes the importance of the cannabis investment group like Michael Gordon over at cush that bring the producers and the retailer's together on couche marketplace really is needed in this industry to enable that growth so people like Frank can fill this whole farm full of plants this is a platform that facilitates large school sale transactions between producers processors and retailers it makes what they do every single day faster easier to ensure fair market price so explain maybe the struggle that a producer or processor would have to get their product in a retail this is such an old-fashioned industry when you're a producer you've got your where say you've got your cannabis and you literally knock on door after door after door and you say hello my name is Michael I've got the best cannabis product but you're one of 200 and to differentiate yourself from that market it's tough to even get a meeting and into the door of a retail store as near impossible for these small and medium-sized farmers so with our relationships with retailers we can help break down those walls and ensure that that they're able to make sales is there anything else you'd like to say oh that's that's what an opportunity to talk about the cannabis industry social change is coming with probably 60 or 70% of the United States being in support of legalization I think it's important to talk with like it's a regular thing learn a little bit about the difference between indica and sativa visit illegal stay walk into a store and see what it's all about we're literally making history here together and to be able to participate in that as a special thing that you probably only get one chance in your entire life to experience such a change like legalize cannabis that's one thing that I have found as I enter the cannabis industry is it's really a community it's a partnership between everybody involved yes I was actually pleasantly surprised by how the industry shaped out because of course you know I was a grower for 15 years in the medical market and you know we all kept to ourselves for the most part it really wasn't everybody kind of had their own ways of doing things real secretive by nature and once the industry started is really really pleased to see how a lot of the growers were helping each other out giving secrets talking about how to get through the inspections with the LCB etc it's really turned into a group a community that you know everybody seems to really care about the other guy there's so much room nobody really has to worry about you know seriously you know the competition real hard there's room to brand and to expand and to grow in so many areas that you know it's still really open I hope it stays that way because it's a definitely a fun crowd I agree the community aspect is one of the things I like most about it it makes it fun it really does we've had some fun at some of these events at way yeah speaking of the Warren G concert right that's that was a fun night I was not expecting to attend a Warren G concert in Bellingham of all places I know it was uh yeah some partners of mine put that together and it was a really fun time it was mostly an industry event we brought a lot of retail store owners in a lot of growers together so it was just a good event to really mingle with the industry plus you know just a bunch of people got to see some brand names up there on the on the sponsorship so you know get some awareness out there to have our companies yeah I think brand awareness is something that a lot of the cannabis industry is struggling with right now absolutely absolutely there's not everybody that's in this even once the branded there's guys out here they just want to grow it and sell somebody else and they just want to grow it they don't really care about that but I'm I'm definitely about building a brand because I'm very proud of my product and I've put a lot of time and effort into really making a high quality product and I'm really proud of it and so I I only wanted to get in this if I could build a brand if I could grow it and put my name on it and say this is my product that's what I didn't wanted to do so the industry has a long way to go to to get all that dialed in that's for sure the wild weird wonderful business of growing pot stickers lots and lots of stickers actually this is important this has a barcode on it and this barcode is required by the state of Washington they track from seed to sale and so there's actually a lot of information on this t-rex one gram that tells you the string t-rex the weight one gram says grown by beacon buds with his license number where is it going the gallery with their license number it also contains the harvest date and Frank referred earlier that you have to do testing on it and so it tells you how much THC isn't it and how much THC a and how much CBD and then the barcode which the retailer uses to scan when they make the sale and one of these barcodes has to go on every single package and it has to be straight right Frank [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hi I'm Matt Lewis I'm the producer of legally Simone that was our first

"LuZtODhMpqs": "[Music] [Music] during the course of the season your crops will face several challenges before harvest time arrives how your crops are able to handle these challenges will determine the kind of yield you get at the end of the season among the challenges your granite cow pee and soybean crops can face are pests drought diseases weeds etc in this message we are going to focus on weeds and the practices that can help manage them to reduce the negative impacts they have on your crops other messages will talk about the other challenges and how to address them accordingly after sowing seeds on your field it does not take long before you see that it's not only your crops that are growing on the phone about weeds to weeds come in different sizes and types but they all cause harm to your crops it is therefore very important to learn how to effectively control them to ensure that they do not harm your crops and reduce your harvest four ways to establish on your field they need a few factors to thrive like all other crops the unique space moisture and new chance to grow but unlike most cultivated crops they are much more resilient and tolerant to lest unfavorable conditions this means that if they are allowed to coexist with the soybean cowpea and grounded crops your crops will be overcome this is the reason why we control measures have to always be timely in cultivating grounds coffee or soybean you have an advantage of other other kind of crops if you use the recommended planting distances you will be able to considerably reduce the amount of space available between crops for weeds to be established weeding activities are very critical in the early stages when your crops have not yet formed a canopy to suppress the of the weeds we didn't shall therefore be done regularly from the second week after planting until the canopies are formed we then shall be done with hoes and not cut classes to reduce the damage to the crops another method of controlling weeds on your farm is through the use of chemicals you can apply pre-emergence with the sides before planting or immediately after planting before any weeds appear on your field with pre imagines with the site you will not need to read your farm regularly because by the time the chemical wears out on your field to allow seeds to germinate your crops would have established a canopy which will make it very difficult for weeds to grow if you decide to use post imagines we decide to control weeds on your farm as you see or inputs dealer for brands of selective breeding sites these kinds of we desires will only kill the weeds and will not cause any damage to your ground Nets cow pee or soil plants weeds crowd our world space crops and prevents them from getting enough water and nutrients from the soil some types of weeds send their roots into the roots of our crop plants and rob them of the up food resulting in very poor growth and development weeds may also carry diseases and pests that cause harm to your plants in total you can with your farm about twice before the plants form a canopy and suppress the growth of weeds on their own the first reading can be done in two or three weeks after sowing with a second one in another two or three weeks after the first reading remember that all weeding activities might must be timely to minimise competition and avoid irreversible damage to your crops chemical weed control saves time and involves less labor costs however if you cannot afford to buy weed decides to fight the weeds on your field make sure you carry out your manual weeding safely without causing any means to the crops in the process by properly controlling the weeds on your field you would have removed one of the challenges faced by your crops in achieving a good yield there will be other messages on pest management and water management which will also address the other challenges thank you [Music]", "-8fVv_oLhro": "sup YouTube here J boogie

have to turn you still have to do this because this is what's going to pay the bills for a while and even if we're well established in the cannabis deal and then even after that we still have to do

series in the history of broadcast to focus on how wonderful marijuana is over the next several months after its debut the series began airing and a variety of cities across the country and within a few short weeks was airing in 103 cities Willie Nelson was on tour that year and noticed that the series was playing in many of the town's that he and the band were singing at and when will he got him to Kentucky and decided to roll up his sleeves and help the gate with Galbraith get elected to the governor's seat which unfortunately that did not happen gateway Galbraith was nice enough to introduce me and Willie Nelson by phone and when he did Willie made a commitment to be a guest on the series and when he came into Los Angeles will he gave me a call and kept his word and you are

about the difficulty of trying to reintroduce it to the economy what do you see hemp actually taking the farmers that they were start being allowed to grow it do you think happen itself could be the the crop that would say the farms for America in a state of Kentucky when the leading agricultural crop there in 1937 was him when they took that away from the farmers it was like it would be like taking we away from Kansas cotton away from Texas okay cattle you know away from it's just devastating what has happened to the farmers in that area since they're leading agricultural crop which as we've all seen is a very beneficial not only beneficial necessary plant that the earth needs if it wasn't supposed to be there the big guy wouldn't put it there mm-hmm you know he didn't make no mistakes so he put him here for a reason one of the reasons I believe is that the route is like 10 to 12 inches long which literally holds the planet together now what happens when you eradicate a plant from the planet if you check history every civilization that has gone under since the beginning of time has gone under because of soil erosion and the inability of the people to be able to feed themselves now is that a serious problem today look at bangladesh look at the places on the planet where hip has been made illegal to grow in the state of iowa that state in the last hundred years has lost over fifty percent of his top soil wow so we're talking we're talking about farming areas that are going down the drain because of some stupid not stupid some very well planned conspiracy to take the hemp plant off the planet to keep it from being competition to the other products that it would be competition to your petrochemicals your paper all the textiles now business is business as they say and anything is fair in war but when you start taking something that valuable away from the planet you're affecting other things other than just business associates you're affecting the our children who eat and where you're affecting yourself and me we're taking food away from healthy food away from our families and we're taking the healthy soil away from our planet what do you think it would take to get the farmers to rally around this plant and to unite across the United States and say give us the right to grow this plant so we can set utilizing it for industrial purposes well the biggest problem is knowledge education I think this is the first thing that has to be done the-the-the American farmer has to be made aware that 50 years ago this was a legal crop and why was it taken away I think he has to start asking himself why is this hidden from me let his but his curiosity start growing why did my grandfather plant him and why can I not plant here now I've heard all about the big scare the marijuana thing but most people who have lived any length of time at all and have been around anything at all in this on this planet knows that if we have any serious problems in the world which we do marijuana is not one of them oh no not really not one over when you start listening our serious problems its way down on the list somewhere and it might be even one of our greatest assets that has been discouraged to make appear to be a bad guy so I think what the followers should do and not only the farmer every taxpayer out there everybody who's affected everybody who eats food should start wondering why are we so kept in the dark over this one plant the hemp plant yeah do you get any slack or difficulty being a performer who advocates the really cool is it really was a shin of him do you I get into a lot of things that I get to lack for yeah I know hard to say where my plaques coming from okay if you had the opportunity to express yourself at any one point in time to the American people and and deliver the message of the farmer what would you say well first of all the fact that you're able to do this show and I'm here talking on it and it means that this idea has come it's time for people to consider it and make a decision one way or another and it's a question you have to ask yourself is it important is the planet worth saving can help really save the planet if it can why is it kept such a secret from us ask yourself these questions call around to some research and make your own conclusions I'd say we are facing a world that needs medicines we are facing a rule that needs food and we are facing a world that's rather stubborn when it comes to dealing with the topic of drugs they seem to overlook the fact that marijuana is a plant that can be ground for as we've said paper fiber and fuel we have people overseas who are growing it for just that is there anything that we can learn from RS our brothers and sisters ever sees do you think that would help we're gonna do this into our economy well you must remember that our brothers and sisters overseas are controlled by the same people who control us here they're planning habits hemp is illegal in many parts of the planet and it's been made illegal by the same people who made it illegal here the oil companies a petrochemical people who are the paper industries the people who own trees on this planet would rather see us chop down the trees and make paper rather than use hemp which could save all the trees there's great there's a lot of opposition here so with this is a war that we're just only beginning stages of and there will be opposition from a lot of people there will be a lot of people throwing a lot of accusations at you at me so you better be ready for well it has been a joy to have you on our program today you know to have heavy honor of you coming in here and speaking on behalf of the farmers I mean you have a voice of authority you know as you've seen it and you've been there and we want to wish you all the luck on what you're doing is there any place that anybody can write or get in contact if they want to get participate in farm aid or if they want to find some way of helping the farmers in their states is there any organizations that you can think of that might benefit from there are many organizations formated funds many different organizations agricultural movements in all the states all the areas and it's very simple to find out who in your area represents the farmers of the farmers alliance or whatever there's there's many many organizations and you can look in your phone book or ask your neighbor and find out who or you can also call one eight hundred farm eight excellent thank you very much don't", "5glF0c3WX_w":

hundred and fifty thousand dollars where the corn growing out here in this field 150,000 that's a pretty good paycheck if everything goes right irrigated it be but you do understand or I'd like you to understand if Nebraska would make marijuana legal legal the drug marijuana legal a medical marijuana this field instead of producing 150,000 would produce 15 million dollars worth of medical marijuana think about that at the same time say you want to grow marijuana but just hemp the hemp version the non-drug version which Canada does at the tune of a billion dollars a year Canada grows hemp if this field was hemp we would be able to make three hundred thousand dollars compared to 150,000 with corn and do it with a lot less herbicides and pesticides and fertilizers now who's Shafton who and who's blowing smoke in whose face and who's stopping the farmer from making a living and who's always stepping on people's rights who hidden in plain sight right off the side of this bridge there's a ten foot plus tall marijuana plant along with dozens and dozens of other marijuana plants why the government doesn't utilize these and get us out of debt I'll never know not for the people to use but for the government to harvest itself and profit by itself with this to the states that simply already have it legal sell it to the states that have it legal and let our own government harvest it you bet why not a lot better idea than raising our taxes in my opinion you know me you know I'm mr. bill you know that I've spent 32 years of my life year-round mind you for nothing on the streets preaching common sense and when the Holy Spirit so who moves me I preach a little religion but be that as it may I preach against any kind of drug use be it cigarettes booze or marijuana and any illegal drug out there I preach against it at the same time I as a taxpayer do not want to have to pay massive amounts of money some thirty thousand dollars a year to keep someone in a cage just because they used marijuana I think that's a terrible atrocity and a waste of tax dollars when our roads our bridges or dams our inter structure in general needs so much help you bet so I would finished with this though until it becomes legal don't do it don't break the laws of this government that only promotes them that only allows them promotions that allows them to eat lobster and brag how they destroyed your life help change come but don't break the law until it does rate this film here in Southwest Nebraska we have a lot of low maintenance roads and hear some of them caved off you barely have enough

Montana and is growing in popularity through a pilot program sponsored by the Montana Department of Agriculture the crop is legal to grow under certain conditions unlike marijuana which is still illegal under federal laws industrial hemp has been given a narrow legal approval under the 2014 farm bill so CBD is what makes the difference between marijuana and hemp hemp grows the CBD where marijuana grows the THC well with that there's no psychedelic effect by using hemp where marijuana you get the THC high and that's that's pretty much the main misconception with it until the early part of the 20th century farmers across the nation grew hemp before 1930 1940 every farmer had to grow hemp it was ordered by the government that every farmer had to grow a certain amount of acres until some lobbying groups from the paper company and newspapers they saw it as a competitor so they started doing the reefer madness and all that and put him with marijuana for farmers like Colby Johnson diversifying the crops he plants helps reduce risk now the farmer I love to grow different things you know it's got to keep farming exciting and with low commodity prices it's a perfect opportunity for him to come into play here obviously it grows really well here and obviously we have a lot of acres to grow it so if we can build a market create a market place we can help out farmers and help out Montana just like other oil seed crops growing in Montana hemp is harvested with a combine while the crop is still green with a moisture of 11 to 17 percent so yeah there's a few different ways to harvest it for different different kinds of oils so when you harvest it for the grain it's just like any other oil seed canola or flax or whatever and so you can just it just gets crushed and that's where you get the hemp seed oil and that goes into foods and topical creams and stuff like that other products made from hemp include fiber paper fabric biodegradable plastics and

also think it's the custody smile our packaging that the flower got kind of smashed a little bit on the road to me that's why I'm a huge fan of the glass jars or those little uh pop tops because they

"Iky_UJzJDxs": "[Music] welcome back to the cannabis male I'm your host Andrew Friedman we're here in beautiful Bowness Calgary to check out beau cannabis beau cannabis is a brand new cannabis store and I thought it'd be really cool to show you guys we're buying legal cannabis in Canada is really like see what the selection is see what the menu is the prices you can have an absolutely candid experience with me let's go check it out hello how are you I'm absolutely wonderful Andy nice to meet you Jason so we're buying cannabis we're doing a video for everybody internationally this is for anybody and everybody to see super exciting you know most of these people have never actually bought legal cannabis and what I do is review cannabis but I try and find the absolute best canvas I can so we chatted a little bit and I was looking for absolute premium canvas so could you tell me a little bit about the menu and then maybe some of the stuff you recommend Primo so I'm gonna start everything that you're seeing that's pink is a sativa and everything that's green is a hybrid and everything is Harper's an indica we've prices is going down that way we've got a beautiful style two categories the crowd-pleaser like the bangin strains and everybody likes the smell along like the flavor profile right now all the crowd please just going down that way we've got some tasty ones like Helios flowers now allowing with a new name and there's only so many strains that actually entered the legal market so it has probably been exciting to learn that solid three-year 500 strains that are in the system I thought like years like independence world but it took me so long to realize it's like ignore everything that you thought you knew and just pretend like this is all totally so producers are kind of similar with producers that's there isn't a huge batch variance between even strains a producer is pretty steadfast in their ability and what about pre-roll Zac there's the other side pre-rolls times of four-year-olds we've got individual four-year-old so we've got past these top two 1/2 gram year olds the rest of bull Graham's awesome we've got packs of either three two or five are you finding anybody getting the pre-roll packs is having a better experience in the singles just because of the moisture that's contained in there and their little half gram joints - as opposed to a 1 gram joy because I noticed that they sell a lot of one gram joints but a lot of places in the world don't actually smoke a 1 gram Heuer cannabis joint right can I can I touch any of this cannabis or do I only get a picture unfortunately it's just pictures ok we can't open nothing so even in the back you can't open something in the store the only way that you get to experiment with the products is if you buy it take it home Wow can I ask about sampling what's it do can you get a sample from a producer can you take anything like is there any way that you're able to give like a clothes recommendation unless you purchased it how quickly does things get rotated in the sample jars do you find anything goes stale because I know Alberta where we are we're in the mountains 0% humidity is that a challenge when actually making the sale oh cool okay Oxana they do so there is an actual supply shortage that's limiting the ability for you to actually assess product in at a store level yeah let's say like our wedding breath compressors are we can put it in like five cases of 24 please and we'll get to it just right you'll get as much as they can give you and kind of cut off the liner that's like the joke so we have it burns clean white ash they put that rate in there which is a big bold statement especially that's a bullet saving because I've had the majority if anybody's watched the channel so far there's been a lot of cannabis that hasn't burned white so that's amazing to see they write burns clean white ash in well we got to try something from them without a doubt that one they're super heavy indica dominant very nice I like that one it's not quite as sleepy as let's play the ice but that one there it really is best with Donna's campus the wedding cake and gelato 33 what we did just have gelato 33 at West fest when the the whole competition it was the number one in to catch a lot of 33 oh I'm and of course I'm forgetting who grew it but I you know what I think we need to try the ice cream cake something I'm super familiar with it's an exotic how they got it into the system I'm confused by but I wish we could see them both it's killing me I like the I kind of like the terpene profile more korabik rofling is my favorite terpene love piney and this one sounds a little bit more gassy where this is a little bit more fruity wedding breath you have two single gram four year olds 442 pounds that's enough it's an expensive but I worry that the pre-roll I won't be able to give the watcher the same experience just not being able to look at the bud time that's the only thing that that's my new like Cuban cigar in the breast pocket when you go somewhere and you want to impress Oh Karla Canyon Tamala slabs I would like I'd like a pack of the that analyst oh Willy oh I didn't notice that there is both from Tantalus oh I want the I want the Blue Dream I'm sorry I want I want Blue Dream for sure I would have been upset if I had the CVD cannabis to be super honest on lots of people love it I'm just not in camp CVD I'm yeah Diet kinda miss exactly yeah well those prices are very equivalent to California $69 for a premium eight is exactly what would translate from a California dispensary so I just hope it's good cannabis is there anything you really would tell customers to stay away from if they're you know the Aurora there's a lot of people in their name they have no section where it's legal for instance which is also on there like similar tier they believe rapid steps to change ours they've increased their humidity like Integra on the inside and one thing I'm a few know but Aurora did poison Sarah my fiance when we first started with them in the medicinal system 2014 there's actually really quality cannabis and there was this crazy quick art where the supply didn't meet the demand they started buying it in they started rushing things and they bought cannabis for morgana gram that she smoked two ounces of it actually had a foliar spray on I believe it was Michael of butanol and and and poisoned her and she's still dealing with the repercussions so you know as you don't suggest Aurora just because of quality I've also seen repercussions on the medical side so that's really really interesting so under Dallas do you have to suggest where people go to smoke cannabis right for a recreational patient what does a medicinal patient I have all the right to go five meters from the door and consume okay no big deal if you're a municipal patient go get your medical card tax benefits and you can smoke cannabis anywhere you want that was a pretty great experience so far I'm excited to see the cannabis and we'll crack it open and really get in on it love that there dog-friendly a lot of other places were really upset about me trying to bring the dog we've got three and a half rounds of the ice quest awesome the Blue Dream by Tantalus labs these guys are real really nice with the tail in here illegally can't much we'll open up some stories and let you smell it I thought it was up to me Oh even though I paid for it I can't open it in here even though you pay for it I can't let you go but it's just the way that it goes we can't have the open stuff without having suet regularly right okay can I so can I share with you in the store like if I was like here's some cannabis is that illegal it has to be destroyed on camera in Canada thank you very much I appreciate you great seeing you always easy we've made it out with cannabis to smoke a strain that I didn't think was gonna be in my hand as we left absolutely fantastic ice cream cake pre-rolls here we go time to go smoke are we heading to Bowness park not on the trolley so we headed down the street to beautiful bow nest part after our wonderful experience at beaux cannabis jason was an excellent excellent bartender a wonderful host he was extremely knowledgeable and I thought it was really interesting to be able to ask him questions about actually sampling the cannabis and his amount of experience the amount of experience that the budtender gets inside of the store in alberta what was crazy to me was the fact that the budtender can't actually touch any cannabis all the samples are leashed in loft you can't open the cannabis and if I purchase cannabis in the store I'm not legally allowed to open it and show the person who just sold it to me even though they may have been incorrect in the way that they sold it very very cool so we're down here we got some pre rolls we got some ice cream cake and I think it's time to have a free roll been looking out for Tantalus labs for quite some time now I've been following Dan Sutton on Instagram he's the founder and Tantalus labs is all Sun growing cannabis they're grown in a beautiful big greenhouse and this is blue dream we have three half Grand Prix rules eleven percent THC this cost me $26 break the duty seal crack it open it does smell nice right off the bat it's almost like a blueberry laid in a bed of spices a little a little bit of ground black peppercorn blueberry some creaminess doesn't that it does smell like blue dream and I like the size of the package because my three pre-rolls fit perfectly in there here's my three pre-rolls the tops are twisted a little bit haphazardly I could say it doesn't really look like this was done by a human and one of the things I could mention actually for a novice consumer is this tail doesn't do anybody any favors for lighting the joint so you could in turn just remove it pack it down like I would and then I would probably just remove this little tail to be super honest because that paper is making no friends while we're lighting our joint but I can understand why they might not do that because now my joint looks very very small I haven't had a half gram joint since I was 14 years old not that I'm advocating for teen cannabis use but that is when most of us have our first cannabis experience so we'll light it up smoke a little bit see how it it's bone a spark beautiful place so behind me is this cool Hextall bridge and the guy that developed all of Bowness his name was John Hextall and this was supposed to be a luxury community outside of Calgary where the rich and powerful would accumulate and they built this beautiful park and one of the things mr. Hextall did was build the crazy bridge behind me to get people here an iron bridge built in 1908 still standing the big thing was was convincing the City of Calgary to bring the trolley to Bowness once that trolley came to Bowness by mr. Hextall actually trading two islands to sit in the middle of the Bow River it became a huge tourist attraction and it used to be filled with Fun Fair every day of the weekend it was the very last stop on the trolley ride and people regale these amazing stories of whipping through tall prairie grass to get to this kind of hidden sanctuary along the river so we can see already my joint burning white haven't even had to smoke it yet and it and it's burning down just as I talked staying lit so that is a really nice sign white ash is something we like I am a medicinal patient so I can't consume cannabis anywhere as long as I'm five meters from the door but if you are recreational patient in Calgary Alberta make sure you're on a private property the cannabis itself has a little bit of that terpene profile to be honest a little bit of blueberry a lot more black peppercorn it's not dead and it's burning white I'm definitely gonna smoke the whole joint which is exciting because if you've followed along I've had a few free rolls on the channel already and a lot of them haven't been very good so to see this no it's son growing delicious tateleh slabs I've overly impressed so as we think about buying legal cannabis in Canada I think there's a few really big standouts one is just the idea that we can't touch or smell the cannabis in the store before we purchase it two is the fact that our budtender can't touch the cannabis or smell the cannabis unless they've purchased it and taking it home and made their own opinion about it it is an amazing opportunity to be able to buy cannabis at a store we have over 70 retail locations in Calgary net right now rec and walk in and buy a joint to my choice go ahead and smoke it so as far as legalization goes that is pretty awesome how can I complain I would definitely check out both cannabis and go ask for Jason he was a great guy happy smoking make sure to LIKE share comment and subscribe Cheers [Music]", "gX2hVSzMcRw": "coming up next tonight one local farmer is breaking a 100-year old tradition in the hopes of reviving the business generations before him have harvested we'll show you some of I witness news reporter Taylor Epps explains why Tony Weiss is now trading in berries for buds it's time to harvest at Weiss farms in Eden we're kind of known for strawberries and then we raised a lot of green beans sweet corn watermelons cantaloupes but this year Tony Weiss is focused on a new crop I'm kind of known for raising something new and different every year and this fella came to me and he says would you like to raise some marijuana gneisses no I says I don't want to get involved I don't want to get arrested but he says what the right license growing hemp is now completely legal in New York State it kind of looks like Christmas trees out here yeah but they don't smell like it Weiss now has 60 acres of the plant there's proof that medical marijuana can help some people with a number of medical conditions people with arthritis people that have seizures people that all have Parkinson's disease and it's endless Tony says all the hemp plants are harvested by hand and then hung in a greenhouse the ones you see here behind me will be ready to go in a week and they'll be shipped off and turned into this this is the cream for your hands Weiss expects the hemp industry to grow throughout western New York and he plans to release his own line of CBD oils and cream and why is this someone who knows what can happen hemp helped him deal with the side effects of chemotherapy four years ago he was diagnosed with lymphoma and now that he's cancer-free he's out at the farm every day checking in on his hemp crops figured good Lord had something else for me to do and he's keeping the business all in the family and now it's going into my son he's in the process of taking over in Eden Taylor EPS 7 Eyewitness News", "fkf7i0fx3Bw": "[Music] my name is Dustin Fox I work for an innovative organics we're here with Yeti farms in Pueblo Colorado this is a recreational and a medical grow and a MIPS processor that you know make chatter and concentrates and what we're doing today is actually putting plants in the ground into our amended soil we brought in a several hundred yards of concentrated compost with biochar and crab shell kelp meal and you know some some of the good organic and probiotic amendments and what we do is we treat the land the way it should be treated we stop all use of synthetics no man-made artificial fertilizers no chelated nutrient salts they're all organics and probiotics and everything that you know that we use comes from someone else's trash it's all waste product from other companies and you know for example the biochar is beetle kill pine from the mountains here in Colorado and the Bocage ET and the you know it's the basis of the Bokashi soils that we produce and what they're you know it's made of fermented trash really and it heals the biology and the native soils and it restores life and regenerates this land like I mean it's it's an amazing process to get to witness you know starting out on these farms and seeing the cracked barren soil it's just sun-baked and then by the end of the season it's it's just amazing what you can witness in one season when we're not putting these synthetic chemicals on on the field crops like like we have been for years and you know this way is it's it's a really you know this is the beginning this is a the revolution is beginning for all of Agriculture this isn't just about cannabis either this is all the way back to every crop and this is the way it should have been for years [Music] hi everybody i'm john from yeti farms i'm the grower here and these are our babies they're going out in the field now at the end of june we just did a large expansion and so we're delayed on getting our license or modification of premises so we're getting them out a little later than usual so they're a lot bigger than we really want them to be when we put them out we're this is our mix these are pretty much all the recreational x' that are going to be going out we're planning the medical field today and tomorrow and that should be done this goes into the new field and there's 1,800 recreational and the thousand medical and you can see they range out the range in size from Dixie Cups with young clones and I'm all the way up to five six foot plants and they've been planted in some very fertile soil it has probiotics in it it's all organic we don't use any chemical fertilizers we use like wonho's and things like that which really helps because we don't end up with having a salt buildup and a problem for plants that are of this size we haven't had to flush them they use up the nutrients and they let you know when they're hungry for more we have done a lot of transplanting as much as we could we were limited on space to have 2800 plants all in veg at once we the greenhouses is pretty loaded we've already taken probably 400 or so plants out of here and we still have the balance of our medical field to go and we'll have a medical and recreational field is the new addition and we can go out and take a look at at the medical field as it is right now these are our the medicals that we've just planned here over the last couple of days these this was just planted today and what again they're a lot larger than we would normally be planting outside because of of our delays and be able to plant so we're trying to get them all in in the next couple of days both medical and recreational this is our Jackie white we have 15 strains on the medical side and seven strains on the rec side plus we just obtained some new genetics so if we added about another 5 strains to our medical side so don't put us about 20 on the medical side four strains as you can see they vary in size the netting will keep them give them a chance to adapt to the wind in the climate because they're out of the greenhouse now and it'll let them grow up reinforce them help the branches develop we'll be able to pull the branches through the netting be able to clean them up so they can go into full veg and flower all here we do only do outside planting we don't do indoor grows at all we do maintain our genetics from one year to the next and then we just transferred the clones to the greenhouse to harden them off to get them used to sunlight so we can bring them out to the field and each roll is grouped by its strain and so we have 21 Jackie White's which is what this is and then we start with our next drain down there and they proceed all the way through until we get all the plants in of that strain then we start onto the next one and these ones as they're being transplanted they're being being given a nice organic tea along with some Bokashi which will help with the micro production in the soil and help them grow into big healthy little girls since this is a we've gone into soil this year we're actually laying down a brand new irrigation system in previous years we actually planted in smart pot planters that work one to two hundred gallon and now we've gone into the native soil and amended it and so we're actually putting an irrigation system that's underneath the mulching plastic and that way I'll keep the moisture in and it'll help spread evenly under the for the roots so the roots can expand evenly throughout the whole growing area and we'll be able to send the nutrients right through the irrigation system so we'll be able to water and feed them at the same time it makes a lot less labor-intensive [Music]", "20JJgYranM4": "hi this is marcona Verde in another edition of investing in community where we cover the amazing organizations and events happening around us and today again I'm with the lovely Jenny ala hey everybody so we're going to be covering this series for six months and we're gonna be watching this cannabis garden grow in a really beautiful setting we're at an undisclosed location for up for obvious reasons so it's gonna be a great series gonna be a long shot long film so we're ready to go right yeah we are and what you can see behind us right now is the where the future garden is going to be and as you can see there's a lot of fava beans growing a lot of wild flowers that's gonna help with the soil I think it's gonna be a great series so has a lot of economic impact in the county as well a lot of benefit so we're I think we're gonna just go ahead and do it yeah let's see how it grows see our girl wildflowers surrounded the field which brought in beneficial bugs bees and the rest as you can see here the garden is planted with fava beans of which will be plowed under later for nutrients these long Gardens with the walkways in between is where the marijuana blue-blue planted these are the clones taken from last year and they have those breather pots which help the clones grow as you can see they're only three or four five six inches high and those will be the plants later this is a view of the field from far away as you can see many of the fava beans so here we are one month later one month later back again and what we see is that the fava beans have died down and are becoming part of the soil so it's feeding the soil for the next crop also the plants have been planted so let's go take a look at the garden see what it's looking like this month and then we'll be back next month in July July is the big month so stay tuned stay tuned now that the fava beans have been plowed under and the straw is also plowed under the small plants are planted and the water supply the water supply uses less to grow marijuana the you would have in a large field of grass or a golf course it's very water efficient here is a pairs of view of the fields now as you can see the fava beans are gone and the straw remains and here are the little clone plants planted in the fields to begin their growing season this is a view of the same field you can see the clones in the ground and the walkways clearly visible here's a side view of a small little clone and as you can see once again they're not very big so we'll be back in a month and take a look and see how much they've grown on the third month we brought our film partner crystal Highline to see the plants and as you can see she's seeing all the beneficial bugs in the soil the size of the plants we welcome crystal to the shoot and you can see lovely crystal with the plants as big as she is in the background so the last month has yielded some tremendous growth it was very hot the day we were there and you can see that some of the plants are even bigger and the native plants and flowers are still there to help with the beneficial bugs and our final shot here is crystal all the way back in the back of the garden you can see that we've experienced quite a bit of growth so we are here on the end of the third month shoot in July with the cannabis farmer and crystal there's pretty incredible plants here they're amazing and I had a great time learning about they have some native carrots Thanks all right yeah for the beneficial bugs yeah and he keeps the weeds down to keep the pests away and it's all done organically sustainably and so it was a pleasure to be here yes okay so that does it for this month shoot of the cannabis farming near the rich and we'll be back with three more shoots to conclude the shoot in October so my name is Mark Kuna birdie I am crystal highlight thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time sounds good sounds good so here we are in mid-august at our grouse shoot again yeah welcome back crystal thank you Mike happy to be here happy to be herself as you can see behind us what once was small plants where we started the film quite a while ago and then there and then last month of course you and I were here and they got even bigger and now I look behind us they're 6 7 feet tall yeah twice as big so three times as big that's right so cannabis is a unique crop mm-hm and tell them about the input and the output of this crop it's amazing well cannabis is a low input you get all your energy from the Sun and it's a high economic value output crop that's right in other words in other words a little bit of labour and a little bit of water and these plants just take off now we had an interesting conversation with the grower about where he supplies this cannabis pharmaceutical grade medical producers are where he provides this crop to and he was telling us about his testing report right this test for any sort of pesticides chemicals they spends a pretty good amount of money on this report yes and it's pretty sophisticated so we were really impressed with it so there we go we're here in mid-august and we're gonna come back when next month next month so we'll take some photographs yeah and they're gonna pick in October mate okay so crystal and I here at the grow again at an undisclosed location we don't even know where it is and we'll be back but meanwhile we'll give you some photos and continue our long series of medical cannabis farming in our fourth month you can see the plants have grown quite large they're 6 7 feet high the Sun again was quite hot today we were there and you can see crystal dwarfed by the plants now there's the same shot we've used in previous videos and the plants are indeed robust in green and there she is overlooking the field made of plants still they're bringing in the beneficial bugs and the water consumption was a lot less than what you might see so the grower tells us and there we are dwarfed by all the plants and now all the clones of this season will be used next season and there's crystal overlooking the field again was quite an interesting last two months the growth so here we are back in the fifth month of our small-scale commercial grow of ganja here in Nevada County and I'm with again a lovely Jenna yellow that's right so we're here and as most of you can see we've got these big plants behind us and we've got about another month to go before it's harvest time so we'll be back another time before then so the grower wanted us to emphasize that the outdoor environment is superior in producing higher quality of medicinal plants than indoors and she's very beautiful out here the medicinal qualities include a treat pain and inflammation address and treat opiate addiction and withdrawal anxiety disorders sleep disorders epileptic seizures and cancer that's right so you know it seems to be the opinion of most people that this area of the you know geological location is too marijuana as maybe Napa might be too wine so you know plants love it here the gardens really thrive here and these outdoor grows you know the emphasis is that you know with a healthy environment you have healthy plants it's pretty incredible and in you know it is pretty incredible here we were last month we didn't see almost no flowers and now it's just yeah looks pretty incredible so we're gonna take some photographs should want to add anything before we move on to the next month you know I did see this interview and I hope I don't say this name wrong but dr. Sanjay Gupta he was saying that it's proven that marijuana will treat pain in fact it will also help in opioid rehabilitation so it helps with opioid Reap withdraws and then it also helps the brain to recover from you know being addicted so these are all facts that you know we said I saw that on CNN the other day sure sure okay so where to take some photographs and then we'll be back here in a month to witness the harvesting yes I'm excited for that early morning morning really morning shoot and then now hopefully we'll also wissinger witness the processing of the of the medicinal products that we put out all right well let's take some pictures of these beautiful plants and then be back here next month okay we'll see you in a month and in the fifth month we welcome is Johnny alla back to the field she's stunned at the amount of growth we've seen the plants are six seven eight feet high as you can see she's dwarfed by the plants and the amount of flowers on the plants are quite incredible she's pointing out some of the thickness of the flowers and again the outdoor grows so says the grower are superior to the indoor grows producing a much higher quality crop and you can see the flowers the native flowers are left to remain and there's the field against the tree backdrop you can see how big they are and in our next shot you will see the concentration of the flowers that have really taken hold in this fifth month and the lovely miss Ayala is dwarfed by the plants in this fifth month shoot and another shot of the flowers in the field and it was a little bit cooler than a that we took this shot and now she's holding the fava beans which will be used for next year's crop so good morning so here we are in our six-month shoot of the small commercial ganja grow in Nevada Canyon with jenny ology yep so we're here early in the morning because this is the time when the plants are going to be the freshest so this garden right here is getting ready to be harvested and the reason why they do it so early in the morning is because as soon as the Sun hits then these plants kind of open up and they want to get it early in the morning so we got this early start as you can see there's a couple of different varieties here that I have in my hand and they're beautiful and impressive they are beautiful impressive I mean take a look at that you could see behind us there's an amazing amount of ganja here this outdoor facility so says the grower is far superior to growing indoors so we wanted to show you the final stage of this grow and we'll have some more information at the end of the video so I hope you've enjoyed the series Jenna and I got up early to be here today what else we want to add well I mean I just want to add that you know this this whole garden and growing marijuana its kind of viewed as a second class sort of agricultural thing and as you can see there's there's nothing violent there's nothing criminal there's nothing dangerous going on here but it is very criminalized and you know we just kind of wanted to bring a different viewpoint out to this and show you how you know this is actually used for medicine and this is it's excellent for people who need help with pain you know we've we've covered the different medicinal uses before and and not only does it have a medicinal use but this also has a really strong economic value in our local common economy and a lot of those topics are kind of overlooked and not really talked about so we want to just bring up that there are other points to these gardens and you know like it's a really beneficial thing for the community this grows really excellent around here and outdoor grows are the best grow the best kind of marijuana and have the best medicine all properties and so you know this isn't a scary thing this is a natural thing and it's really beneficial for the community and for the people couldn't have said it better myself okay so that does that we hope you've enjoyed this six-month extended shoot from Jen and I it's been fun it has been fun that does it for this edition that's long edition investigate community where we bring the amazing events organizations and sometimes interesting things happening in Nevada County you can contact us at money matters at cave amara.org my name is Mark Cunha birdie I'm John Ayala thanks for watching and in the final six month you can see the flowers are quite pronounced the harvesting has begun here's the filled with half of it harvest and you can see the slag of the plants is left on the ground and finally into the drying room where the plants are hung upside down and that allows the resident to get down into the plants themselves you can see we walk through the drying room and it was quite a bit flying as well been an interesting shoot over the last six months and we hope you have enjoyed the coverage [Music]", "bbKzKJXuFZg": "back here kills his garden 2x4 10 kills was killed off it is officially week 8 day 56 see

concentrated right here to hold grow so well all the know they're still gonna smoke off some but still come dog are still going to drive is still going to rock up that's gonna do what it do once again this is kids this garden to my full update for kids let's come dog you can grow it signing up", "bxUCbe6M0Hk": "welcome back to the talking hedge I'm Josh Kincaid Capital Markets analyst and host of your cannabis business podcast today we're going to take a look at the hem farm in the UK that was forced to destroy over a quarter million dollars worth the crop due to a lack of knowledge really to help us kind of take a look at that law and how the police kind of fumbled that is katrina Glogau ski angel investor and attorney katrina thanks for being back with us thanks Josh alright so in case you haven't seen there's an issue here where in the UK you can grow hemp but you have to apply for and there are some stipulations or restrictions you can't have anything as green that includes Leafs or the the flower but you can't have seeds and press that into oil and you can have you know CBD and some other derivatives so that presents a little bit of an issue when this crop got destroyed apparently there's a Cooperative announced that it had to destroy 40 acres located in central England so the destruction means a lost revenue of quarter of two hundred thousand pounds and they were gonna use that exclusively to sell hemp seed oil and hemp protein powder without using the flour so kind of an issue because that would have generated 2.9 million u.s. and revenue at the retail price and about 586 thousand of that would have been in tax revenue but with it being destroyed not much you can do with it Josh this is a classic example of individuals legislators and governmental bodies writing legislation without understanding what they're legislating you can't have flour but you can have extract well you need to have flour to get to extract that is just basic and I really encourage legislators attempting to craft craft new statutes new regulations and rules to engage with stakeholders and this mistake would not have been made I just I'm stunned by by this destruction of an entire crop and I feel bad for this farmer because from my understanding granted I've only read an article he was growing compliantly this was he had a license he grew what he had a license to grow and when to harvest it and how to destroy it I don't I don't understand the totality of circumstances how we got here but the implication is you can't have flower so they destroyed it you know literal interpretation on the statute no flower but the practical implication of that statute is no CBD product at all because you need the flower to get to the product chicken in the egg this is unfortunate Josh it's very reminiscent of circa 2018 when Idaho confiscated about 7,000 pounds of hemp because they didn't think it was legal it's a yeah not kind of following up with the laws and so when you have these niche laws or exceptions or just a lack of uniformity I guess when you have your own individual state laws without kind of this federal oversight it makes it really tough so I'm not really sure how people can stay in compliance in England knowing that their flowers not protected well first of all they have to change the statute then they have to educate the officials but at the same time in Josh you and I talked repeatedly about the dangers of entering this industry and the importance of compliance and this is a perfect example again the article implies that the that the farmer was compliant with with the intent of the statute you know growing hemp he had a license and then it was destroyed because of misunderstanding and that's a risk in this industry if you're an investor if you're a farmer it doesn't matter you get an individual enforcement officer that says this looks like cannabis destroy it you get a body that says no no no a regulatory body that says no no no you you can't have flour because they don't understand that you need the flour to make the extract again these are regulatory risks that every business and this industry faces and it should be a cautionary tale to both investors and farmers entering this industry it's kind of crazy if you have to you know print out the law and have it handy for the law men when they come reminds me of you know of some conspiracy theorists who make note of the difference between maritime law and civil law so when they get pulled over they say I have the right to travel unmolested this is a not a car this is my property I'm not driving I'm traveling so when you have to kind of explain laws to an officer you kind of sound like a conspiracy theorist wackos I mean the law men should know the law but I think it does provide a possible opportunity because what they see is you can apply for a license for an exemption so you can have a novel food license now with the ban in Washington in California and basically everywhere now with CBD edibles beverages is this a workaround is there some sort of novel food license that would exempt some companies from being able to do that in the u.s. like they can in the UK there is no novel food license equivalent in the United States the FDA regulates food items the FDA has already commented on CBD in food items on CBD in any type of consumable form including tinctures and lotions and even in animal feed products but I think the the closest equivalent we would have here would be grass certification of the for hemp agricultural products that was granted some time ago with the hemp seed oil and the non-viable hemp seeds being marketed as like a fiber supplement protein supplement and so that would be the closest equivalent but again that's not really what they're talking about here that there's there's no novel food thing that has an equivalent from the UK to the u.s. Josh well I want to thank my guests Katrina go Gao ski angel investor an attorney thanks for helping us unpack this whole thing with the UK being forced to destroy about a quarter million dollars worth of hemp for absolutely no reason yeah unfortunately Josh it is unfortunate with that we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the Talking Heads don't forget to Like share and

it's your boy jake from over at j's place tv and hooked on autism and you know i got the beautiful black sheep with me i'm actually filming autism my name's nicole somebody didn't want to introduce me but it's cool it's cool you got your alabama tattoo vietnam brand new yeah wait that's another video it's all right so today today though we're doing this unboxing yeah can y'all believe babes we got content coming out this is seeping out back there man i don't know it might rain a storm or something here in a minute it's supposed to rain it is so let's go ahead because i'm doing videos but hey check this out the unboxing comes from my fam you know i got the grind already look at me got the grinder the tray the cigarette see i even do the um right it seems like some goodies in here from industrial hem farms you know what it is we're gonna get into it somebody told me a little surprise in here so i'm trying to see that let's get it crack i ain't even gonna waste no time y'all got stuff to do i got stuff to smoke you know i had a surprise before i even got in the box here uh oh uh oh what is this just so y'all can see let's see what this is let's see what this is pineapple express hey y'all i like the name though yeah me too oh yeah i picked this i've been fooling with industrial for a long long time right and they packaging though it's getting better and better oh man it's getting dope because now what you get is right there i know y'all can see it ain't gonna clear up but that's where the strand is written there if you ever order something from industrial prior to you know used to come in the tan little brown bag with the thing rolled up there look look at god boy look at it pineapple express oh and that's a 3.5 grams and you got the scan code for all your uh not thc but cbd uh information on there this is a uh seven grams right there seven grams and this is fruity pebbles fruity foreign [Music] this is 14 grams of jack frost cbg and a lot of y'all know that i've been doing a lot of cbd reviews i've only had one encounter with cbg and i found out that cbg is normally drier than the uh cbd strand so this is gonna be interesting for me um yeah this is an industrial video i'm not gonna go into the other cbg that i got but this is jack frost and that is a half ounce surprise all right so what i'm opening now is what i believe to be a cartridge yes these are cbd vape cartridges yes this is fly right here this is how your vape juice comes and here we go right and this one is look so i'm gonna say it's like skittles but it starts with a z i don't even know how to pronounce it but it's skittles ziddles concealed is right here little wayne the baby all of them people that's right up here that's that one this is purple punch and they are one gram each with the skin colored on it the back is plain which is great because once you take it out y'all look at the back no damn way right so we got that i have the battery that connects to the cartridge right here uh it says three clicks to adjust the voltage red is 3.6 volts blue is 3.1 and white is 2.7 being that i have never used one of these i'm gonna start with the white when i do the review on this because i don't want to overheat my juice and it tastes all weird because i like flavor um two clicks to preheat hold for 15 seconds so i guess um the preheat voltage is 1.8 is what i'm getting here five clicks to turn it on and off nicotine containing products and uh this is max battery so that is the battery that goes with the vape i told y'all we had some goodies coming y'all been watching these videos y'all know let's see it right there you feeling now they shouldn't i think they should wait till the video you think so i think they should wait for the parts for the unboxing yeah this this yo this is touching right here we go we're gonna put that over there because this was the unboxing everything but what y'all haven't seen um so these will make good for reviews i mean we still don't review yeah some yeah so i don't think you know we just try playing just wearing a science though yeah i never think that and even if you do who you gonna check boo uh let me go right here so i can try to run something off to y'all right quick uh i said fruity pebbles pineapple express jack frost right pm battery um i thought they were gonna have the uh what's your content on here you mentioned them how to enter the giveaway though i ain't even got to the giveaway i even got to the giveaway i think you should forgot y'all i forgot i ain't forgot but in this last little two minutes i got right here there is a 1k giveaway going live on my channel as we speak um um under 200 subscribers away from 1k when i hit 1k there will be a quarter pound giveaway um how many people though four people at first i was gonna do one person but if you've been following the videos majority votes came in and they said that i should share the quarter pound amongst four people so hey that's how we gonna rock it so when i hit a thousand subscribers hopefully you two let me go live the day i hit a thousand because i'm gonna be trying yeah i'm gonna let you know now i'm gonna be trying and uh i'm gonna have four numbers picked out in my head and during that live i'm gonna be asking people to guess those four numbers and whoever gets it right will have a dm me on instagram your information and guess what the mailman will bring you you got it the whole house so i'm giving back man it's the beginning of the giveaways because i'm pretty sure i can get with my people and we can get you some real real good goodies here so with that being said i appreciate you all for fooling with me this is my industrial hip forms unboxing y'all gotta stick around the next one after this is gonna be dope dope other than you know the og right which one are you most excited to try to figure out like man i i really i really got my mind on that fruity pebbles because i like flavorful stuff so not saying the pineapple is not gonna do it but i really really got my mind on that uh that fruity pebbles but i really think that jack frost is gonna hold a lot more flavor only because the cbg might be a little more potent so i haven't had a lot of experience with cbg so the vapes now those are you nervous about it because it's going to be out of laundry right yeah i've never yeah i never did a cbd bait ever so um anissa this buzz for you girl after you know we get into the og yeah yeah so yeah i guess what the face is going to do this video i don't know i don't know i ain't even going to line them up i ain't got a lot of y'all or none of that uh everything will get a review everything will go through the j score you know i mean that's something new that i'm trying to remember to do here's my j score so we're gonna score the unboxing right quick and we're gonna get y'all out of here so uh product-wise packaging-wise full-fledged 10 because i'm telling y'all if y'all been rocking with me since i started doing uh since i started doing damn this shade packaging-wise they get attended because i've seen it come from where it was to where it is and i love it um and that's really all you could do like the box wasn't messed up the information is a lot smaller the only thing that i'm missing is my letter to law enforcement to tell me to tell you this yeah that's the lab report but i like you know the sheet of paper to say ah me the hell alone this is not what you thought it was let me go so i can smoke my cbd in the park thank you you know but other than that it's cool because i got plenty of them from you know i keep one on hand in my wallet anyway but if you are receiving a package of your first time cbd make sure that you have the letter to law enforcement uh it will save you a lot of headache just keeping it 100. we about to move into the next phase of this unboxing the unboxing will drop first and this one will when i say be right behind it they might go up the same day because it's got it it's usually stopping father bro uh the industrial account phone where y'all can get some of these good little products will be down in the description if they remember yeah i got to go back through my videos and put the link in there so i'll be doing that tonight too what else you got a discount problem it may have some kind of discount too but i have never went there through the link you know any other way because i go into my side so i'll see if i can do that i'll work on that hopefully by the time i hit 1k we can come up with some kind of code but like i say all the time be easy and you can't be easy just be easy at it stick around for part two b and we go", "ebvfMbEnnyA": "hi this is mark cuna Verde in another edition of investing in community where we cover the amazing organizations and events happening around us and today again I'm with the lovely Jenny ala hey everybody I'm so we're going to be covering this series for six months and we're gonna be watching this cannabis garden grow in a really beautiful setting we're at an undisclosed location for up for obvious reasons so it's gonna be a great series it's gonna be a long shot long film so we're ready to go right yeah we are and what you can see behind us right now is the where the future garden is going to be and as you can see there's a lot of fava beans growing a lot of wild flowers that's gonna help with the soil I think it's gonna be a great series so has a lot of economic impact in the county as well a lot of benefit so we're I think we're gonna just go ahead and do it yeah let's see how it grows wild flowers surrounded the field which brought in beneficial bugs bees and the rest as you can see here the garden is planned with fava beans of which will be plowed under later for nutrients these long Gardens with the walkways in between is where the marijuana bloo-bloop planted these are the clones taken from last year and they have those breather pots which help the clones grow as you can see they're only three or four five six inches high and those will be the plants later this is a view of the field from far away as you can see many of the fava beans so here we are one month later one month later back again and what we see is that the fava beans have died down and are becoming part of the soil so it's feeding the soil for the next crop also the plants have been planted so let's go take a look at the garden see what it's looking like this month and then we'll be back next month in July July is the big month so stay tuned stay tuned now that the fava beans have been plowed under and the straw is also plowed under the small plants are planted and the water supply the water supply uses less to grow marijuana the you would have in a large field of grass or a golf course it's very water efficient here's a pairs of view of the fields now as you can see the fava beans are gone and the straw remains and here are the little cloned plants planted in the fields to begin their growing season this is a view of the same field you can see the clones in the ground and the walkways clearly visible here's a side view of a small little clone and as you can see once again they're not very big so we'll be back in a month and take a look and see how much they've grown on the third month we brought our film partner crystal Highline to see the plants and as you can see she's seeing all the beneficial bugs in the soil the size of the plants we welcome crystal to the shoot and you can see lovely crystal with the plants as big as she is in the background so the last month has yielded some tremendous growth it was very hot the day we were there and you can see that some of the plants are even bigger and the native plants and flowers are still there to help with the beneficial bugs and our final shot here is crystal all the way back in the back of the garden you can see that we've experienced quite a bit of growth so we are here on the end of the third month shoot in July with the cannabis farmer and crystal there's pretty incredible plants here they're amazing and I had a great time learning about they have some native carrots Thanks all right yeah for the beneficial bugs yeah and he keeps the weeds down to keep the pests away and it's all done organically sustainably and so it was a pleasure to be here yes okay so that does it for this month's shoot of the cannabis farming near the rich and we'll be back with three more shoots to conclude the shoot in October so my name is Mark Cunha birdie I am crystal highlight thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time sounds good sounds good so here we are in mid-august at our grouse shoot again yeah welcome back crystal thank you Mike happy to be here happy to be herself as you can see behind us what once was small plants where we started the film quite a while ago and then there and then last month of course you and I were here and they got even bigger and now I look behind us they're six seven feet tall yeah big so three times as big that's right so cannabis is a unique crop mm-hm and tell them about the input and the output of this crop it's amazing well cannabis is a low input you get all your energy from the Sun and it's a high economic value output crop that's right in other words in other words a little bit of labour and a little bit of water and these plants just take off now we have an interesting conversation with the grower about where he supplies this cannabis pharmaceutical grade medical producers are where he provides this crop to and he was telling us about his testing report right this test for any sort of pesticides chemicals they spends a pretty good amount of money on this report yes and it's pretty sophisticated so we were really impressed with it so there we go we're here in mid-august and we're gonna come back when next month next month so we'll take some photographs yeah and they're gonna pick in October mate okay so crystal and I here at the grow again at an undisclosed location we don't even know where it is and we'll be back but meanwhile we'll give you some photos and continue our long series of medical cannabis farming in our fourth month you can see the plants have grown quite large they're 6 7 feet high the Sun again was quite hot the day we were there and you can see crystal dwarfed by the plants now there's the same shot we've used in previous videos and the plants are indeed robust in green and there she is overlooking the field made of plants still they're bringing in the beneficial bugs and the water consumption was a lot less than what you might see so the grower tells us and there we are dwarfed by all the plants and now the clones of this season will be used next season and there's crystal overlooking the field again was quite an interesting last two months the growth so here we are back in the fifth month of our small-scale commercial grow of ganja here in Nevada County and I'm with again a lovely Jenna yellow that's right so we're here and as most of you can see we've got these big plants behind us and we've got about another month to go before it's harvest time so we'll be back another time before then so the grower wanted us to emphasize that the outdoor environment is superior in producing higher quality of medicinal plants than indoors and she's very beautiful out here the medicinal qualities include a treat pain and inflammation address and treat opiate addiction and withdrawal anxiety disorders sleep disorders epileptic seizures and cancer that's right so you know it seems to be the opinion of most people that this area of the you know geological location is too marijuana as maybe Napa might be too wine so you know plants love it here the gardens really thrive here and these outdoor grows you know the emphasis is that you know with a healthy environment you have healthy plants it's pretty incredible and in you know it is pretty incredible here we were here last month we didn't see almost no flowers and now it's just yeah looks pretty incredible so we're gonna take some photographs she want to add anything before we move on to the next month you know I did see this interview and I hope I don't say this name wrong but dr. Sanjay Gupta he was saying that it's proven that marijuana will treat pain in fact it will also help in opioid rehabilitation so it helps with opioid Reap withdraws and then it also helps the brain to recover from you know being addicted so these are all facts that you know we saw I saw that on CNN the other day sure sure okay so we're to take some photographs and then we'll be back here in a month to witness the harvesting yes I'm excited for that early morning morning she's really mourning shoot and then now hopefully we'll also wissinger witness the processing of the of the medicinal products that we put out all right well let's take some pictures of these beautiful plants and then be back here next month okay we'll see you in a month and in the fifth month we welcome miss Johnnie ala back to the field she's stunned at the amount of growth we've seen the plants are six seven eight feet high as you can see she's dwarfed by the plants and the amount of flowers on the plants are quite incredible she's pointing out some of the thickness of the flowers and again the outdoor grows so says the grower are superior to the indoor grows producing a much higher quality crop and you can see the flowers the native flowers are left to remain and there's the field against the tree backdrop you can see how big they are and in our next shot you will see the concentration of the flowers that have really taken hold in this fifth month and the lovely miss Ayala is dwarfed by the plants in this fifth month shoot and another shot of the flowers in the field and it was a little bit cooler than a that we took this shot and now she's holding the fava beans which will be used for next year's crop so good morning so here we are in our six-month shoot of the small commercial ganja grow in Nevada Canyon with jenny ology yep so we're here early in the morning because this is the time when the plants are going to be the freshest so this garden right here is getting ready to be harvested and the reason why they do it so early in the morning is because as soon as the Sun hits then these plants kind of open up and they want to get it early in the morning so we got this early start as you can see there's a couple of different varieties here that I have in my hand and they're beautiful and impressive they are beautiful impressive I mean take a look at that you could see behind us there's an amazing amount of ganja here this outdoor facility so says the grower is far superior to growing indoors so we wanted to show you the final stage this grow and we'll have some more information at the end of the video so I hope you've enjoyed the series Jenna and I got up early to be here today what else we want to add well I mean I just want to add that you know this this whole garden and growing marijuana its kind of viewed as a second class sort of agricultural thing and as you can see there's there's nothing violent there's nothing criminal there's nothing dangerous going on here but it is very criminalized and you know we just kind of wanted to bring a different viewpoint at this and show you how you know this is actually used for medicine and this is it's excellent for people who need help with pain you know we've we've covered the different medicinal uses before and and not only does it have a medicinal use but this also has a really strong economic value in our local common economy and a lot of those topics are kind of overlooked and not really talked about so we want to just bring up that there are other points to these gardens and you know like it's a really beneficial thing for the community this grows really excellent around here and outdoor growths are the best grow the best kind of marijuana and have the best medicine all properties and so you know this isn't a scary thing this is a natural thing and it's really beneficial for the community and for the people couldn't have said it better myself ok so that does that we hope you've enjoyed this six-month extended shoot from Jen and I it has been fun that does it for this edition that's long edition investigate community where we bring the amazing events organizations and sometimes interesting things happening in Nevada County you can contact us at money matters at cave amara.org my name is Mark Cunha birdie I'm John Ayala thanks for watching and in the final six month you can see the flowers are quite pronounced the harvesting has begun here's the filled with half of it harvest and you can see the slag of the plants is left on the ground and finally into the drying room where the plants are hung upside down and that allows the resident to get down into the plants themselves you can see we walked through the drying room and it was quite a bit drying as well been an interesting shoot over the last six months and we hope you have enjoyed the coverage [Music]", "frtCoP6TLas": "[Music] [Music] what's good YouTube family it's a boy CBG smoke doctor back with another review today's review

you're in a foreign language if you're a linguist you know study all the different languages that you that they'd have you know the different words for cannabis and him can't cannabis sativa sativa is a Latin word for useful so cannabis sativa a useful plant now they call it the devil's lettuce you know so it's it's really twisted the way they change that but we know it's useful cannabis the word canvas is actually derived from the word cannabis so the Conestoga wagons that explored our western frontier were covered with canvas made out of cannabis so it's really cool and this is the Chinese symbol for him it's a very straightforward symbol of a shed with a couple hip plants or cannabis plants hanging upside down to dry so I don't approve of tattoos however you're looking to get one that might be a good one you did so we have linguistics but there are areas if you're into biology or chemistry we need to understand the makeup of the hemp stock the cannabis stock is very complex it's got these long fibers that long bast fibers that run the entire length of the stock and then the inside of the stock is just woody herd material which is very high in cellulose and this is an electron microscope picture of a hip herds so you can see how you know it's just the pattern of it there's a lot of things we can do by studying this or study the composition of a hemp seed you know why does it have such good you know percentage of proteins in the central fatty acids and how can we make hemp seeds with better nutritional value so there's a lot of different areas in this this realm for you to look at if you're in engineering we need a lot of work in the engineering area thanks to reefer madness thanks to the fact that we haven't been able to grow hemp for 70 years in America the entire hemp industry has basically been decimated in America and there's been zero research and development into all of the machinery used to harvest and process him so we need engineers out there we need students to the new machines that process hemp fiber this is an old machine and the hip fiber would go in just like this and the wheels would crush up you know it's separate the herds from the fiber but we need we need people to look at that we need to look at the hemp fiber it grows hemp grows 10 to 12 feet tall in the fiber runs the entire length of the stalk so it's one continuous piece which means the tensile strength is very high which means it's very good for composite materials composite plastics so if you're into composites and you want to develop a green material look at hemp fiber and develop that you know document it so we can show that it's a great thing for composite materials and that our farmers should be able to grow it", "LUxkp8fFvds": "that's good you too it's your boy CBD smoke doctor I am back with another review and this review is from my people if you're still on quarantine if you're still staying home I am and if you're still you know needing some weight I got you if you need it for the low low - so these flowers that I'm about to show you we're not on my last Hinton farms flourless so this time I got three more doesn't need to show you guys and yes indeed the price is right guys they're gonna go on the site they got a new product list with all the information they have the CEOs on there and the price list okay guys so we're gonna start we got sour tea and it's the first new one I gotta slowly does so with the sour tea it has 14 point one to six percent CBD it has a moisture level of twenty nine point six percent and shout-out to miss Linda to always hit me up with all the good info I liked her a lot all right it's under the zero point three percent THC threshold that makes it legal okay then over here we got the t1 guys all right so this t1 is packed in fifteen point five to six percent CBD and it has eleven point four percent moisture level and again under the zero point three percent THC threshold that makes it legal then we got their stormy Daniels and that's packing 18 for eighteen point four six four percent CBP 10.8% moistured and again it's under the zero point three percent THC threshold it's legal guys so these are the analysis for those three flowers now I can't really give you guys the full prices on YouTube they are a mile behind they told me that that you're selling products and what I'm not doing is selling products I'm simply reviewing these flowers for you guys so you can see the quality of the flower well you but it's up to you okay guys YouTube why don't mess with me man anyway now let's get a look at these box okay so we got the sound with tea let's open that up call these black labels but this far over here guys this is what you're gonna get when you buy in bulk whatever you want you don't have to be big bowl not same pounds but let me tell you them cheaper to buy a bunch pounds so we're gonna take a couple of these out so I could give you our guys and look at it I have to save some room cuz I got my little tray out today guys a little [ __ ] I don't know why so that's a good enough time you gotta see this is the sour teeth removal nothing sour tea guys sour tea okay and ya already know y'all about to get the close-ups is the t1 we're gonna mix those up so we've got the t1 here okay so I have to tell you guys these these prices all right these prices are definitely right okay let me show you this knob this is the t1 okay that's the t1 now let's take a good look at this storm again now I'm a stormy damn uses look at one look at this so stormy Daniels thanks big Oh nuts all right so that's the biggest of them all so right now what do time guys some close-ups oh yeah I know exactly would it look like would you be receiving when you go check them out I'm gonna put the information on the bottom of the video so yeah guys take these out okay you two so Natalie back we got a look at the three flowers the sound with t2 t1 the stormy Daniels so I gotta let you guys know the smell these these guys have a earthy smell to them they have all earthy smelling flowers so the only difference I'm gonna be able to tell is in the smoke itself now the flowers they all three have different looks but they all smell earthy so we're gonna whip out the grinder now I'm gonna grind up sour tea has some nice red hairs on this our T by the way guys so some of the flowers like the sour tea is it's lighter than the tea one has the same amount of darkness as the starving Daniels and what the tea one seems to be more dense it's more tighter and store McDaniel's like leafy guys it's leave me that's what I see okay why look at that crushes up nice and fluffy that's the sour tea now we're gonna crush up the t1 because I want to get it all crushed up that way I can sample them all at one time all right how's the t1 now we're going to take a piece of this stormy Daniels we're gonna crush that up to like I said again guys all three DS have an earthy smell okay flowers kind of nice things on my brain okay I mean they all brined it up pretty nice too so now it's time to get some in the love and see what this be like remember guys this is what you get when you order your product and I know the last time I was telling you guys I think it was like 150 to 200 pounds so I can't give you the exact on these pants but I'm telling us around that so this one right here soured tea first guys let's try the sour tea is this our team of them try first choose it's time to be completely honest the flower tastes a lot better than it smells because to me I like the smells earthy earthy earthy earthy but it actually has a fresh taste [Music] a light smooth smoke [Music] and for the price I gotta say is pretty decent it's pretty decent for the price okay now this is where you're gonna get some weight on the budget and thin farms so it like I said tell you for the price this is good I'm always trying to help my fellow people out here you know what I mean we gotta stick together in this community [Music] so that was the sour tea we're gonna move on let me get this out of the pipe here next one we got is the t1 so we're gonna get the t1 in here and guys I gotta say had no seeds whatsoever unless you're collecting it's a plus if you're trying to use them and grow a little something in the closet or something so here's the t1 Cheers okay so that t1 is definitely different than the sour team now the t1 is a little stronger and it packs a little punch so you have a heavier smoke but it's not bad or anything is just a heavier smoke have an earthy and floral flavor with it but with me I like the sour team right to silent T so far I'm going to sour t2 t1 not bad but I like to sour tea so far let's see if that stormy Daniels take me by Starr all right so two strands in I'm filling this our teeth t1 is alright to meet you but I'm choosing I want to pick the sour tea I like that sour team as the stormy Daniels we're loading up and you see that sticky it sticks to my finger while I'm trying to match it inside of the UH pipe here guys cheers let me let you guys know was this bow [Music] okay that's different that's different [Music] different you see sitting here it's different it's like a floral fragrance [Music] sweet [Music] [Music] the smoke is a tad bit harsh dysentery so it's sweet floral smoke is tad harsh II may be to some people as you can see it doesn't have me coughing that much so you know it's not that bad but I'm giving you guys a description of the smoke the flavor and as far as the way I feel after the sour tea I was already feeling the effects they all three have a decent amount of CBD and so armed they are doing the job guys so the effects are all there all right right now I got this um I got this nice calming and it's mostly in the head so you will get effect from this and this is the nice moon once stormy Daniels this also smooth so I have to go one two three shower teeth with one stormy for 2 and T 1 for 3 alright so smoke doctor signing out I'll be back with another review soon guys alright these thanks for watching", "avkOv07pKFM": "what's up everybody this greca just wanted to show you this little outdoor grow i don't know how little you want to call this plant but yeah my my boy to the left right there six foot even so you guys can kind of gauge for yourself how massive this plan is its getting front of it open your arms yeah and it's not even in flowering yet though has about two and a half months left talk about a massive bush just so you guys know it's one plant there's the stock [Music] [Applause] and this is the original CEM dog bred in a beautiful state of Colorado catch guys later", "_KA29Ucc0aI": "[Music] it was of YouTube this is most of the CEM for these are just the tops these I didn't trim really because I'm gonna make a lot of them use a trim this one bud right here weighs 53 and a half grams just to give you an idea this one right here is fifty three and a half grams the one next to it is pretty chunky too they all are [Music] bowlful and I hate to do this but I got to show you this little one rock art sponging it kind of spongy yeah I have no idea how much is here these are the biggest buds I've ever grown so I'd be shocked if there's not at least a pound Kim for I'm gonna go get some new clones today I have no idea what's in stock so depending on what they have is what I'll choose when I get something really fruity to make good oil like lemon skunk or orange juice Romulan grapefruit maybe Sour Diesel a match actually it might be Sour Diesel this is all just like this one right here with the stab weighs 14 grams this here weighs 4 grams it's been in the tent for four days three days so there's probably about as much as is down here about twice that much more still in the tent to go if just crap that was all on the lower parts of the okay I'll show you [Music] still got all this work I basically just took the tops and left everything else it's probably another quarter pound in there all right I just wanted to show you guys [Music] alright thanks for looking", "Snsy_fWLEN8": "hello welcome to weed in the garage week 13 I wasn't gonna do a video today by that whale let's just keep on there so I'm consistent mainly I'm doing this for my own good anyway so you know today I was just kind of out messing in my field a little bit I took my skid stirrer and kind of went around this area on the outside of my plantings you can see the like the grass and the weeds were starting to kind of come back so I thought well before I plant in those areas I wanted to maybe try to get rid of some of those weeds try to control that the other thing I got going on is I'm I'm taking my plants here and I'm putting some mulch around them also taking the tags and moving up higher you know when you first put those tags on there way on the bottom so that's really the only spot you can put them but you know eventually they get kind of lost in the bottom of the plant so I just moved them up so they're higher but you can see the mulch you know I'll walk back to my mulch pile I finally found this sweet spot in the mulch pile which my mulch should I'm using here is just some decomposing hay with oh it's probably got a little horse manure and whatnot in it that was just from cleaning up the barns but it's you know mainly mainly hay yet but you can see it's it's quite actually warm and you know you look at it that's wet it's warm and it's makes a darn good mulch you know the purpose of the mulch is to a couple things that it'll kind of suppress the weeds around the plant it'll hold in moisture and also leach you know some nutrient down to the plant so you know as you you know they grow it to just good to have a mulch around I would say the biggest benefit is probably to hold the moisture in you know as the summer drags on and you know you're not getting rain you know most likely I'm gonna have to set up an irrigation system but so far I've been watering these all individually by hand so that that's gonna get old quick especially once I get everybody out here in the next few weeks so we'll come up with something for irrigation like I said before forest I always like to see how forest is doing and he's down here on the end he's got a few yellow leaves on the bottom and I'm sure what he's telling me if it's just time to give those leaves up or if he needs a little nutrient but you can see he's he's a nice plant he's doing quite well I might have taken a couple clones off of him but not a lot you know most of these other plants I did some you know pretty massive cloning off of him you can see some of those interior you know nodes are gone and on the bottom I've taken a lot of them off to get the the clones that I have but Bill though uh you know they'll continue to grow and fill out and I don't really think it's gonna even be noticeable to any degree by the end of the year that you took that step off but you know some of these plants have some pretty decent height to them already I don't you know that this one here is probably a solid two feet tall it looks to be one of the taller plants this first one we were looking at was a really nice plant this one I had cloned a lot I think I took 16 and clones out for this thing you know a few weeks ago but you know that's a nice plant right there I've got a couple of them that I just don't know what's going on with him certainly I didn't clone off of it like I really don't know what is going on with this plant it's been just a nightmare since the get-go I mean it seems to be growing and getting bigger but you know the leaves are all kind of curling in so I might have to do a little homework to see what that thing's problem is I thought it would kind of self correct as it grows but doesn't seem to really do that but other than that you know these are the first clones that I did that I have in the ground and you know you can see they're doing pretty well this one I kind of run over a little bit so he had a little beaten to recover from but you know all in all they're doing pretty well he's last - I just put in yesterday they were a little slow getting going but once they started to grow they've they've taken off and are going quite nicely you really can't tell the difference between that one and this one as you can see the rest of them down the line here anyway hopefully when I get this all done in the next few weeks we'll have plants you know pretty much this whole area filled up you know probably give or take 275 plants are better let's see exactly you know but yeah he might be wondering where my dogs are I was running my skit stirrer earlier like I said then when I I'm running that I just do not let him outside I would not want to run one over so I don't trust them to be out of the way they're generally pretty good but you know like I said a I don't always trust them to be where they shouldn't be so they're not out here with me now but I guess that just kind of reminded me it's time to go let them out and see what they're doing they haven't missed a show yet they certainly wouldn't miss this one

again another cannabis showcase for you guys um this strain is called Kim dog it is grown right around in our area and this is some fire right here eyes it does have a little bit of parp in it it does have some of the darker buds see there's one right there see the buds get really dark sometimes almost like a purple hint um you can definitely see that Warren chairs everything that you know is good signs a good weed but we're just going to sit here and admire this real quick in this video that's what my cannabis showcases are going to be guys we're just going to admire the strain that I have at that point in time or if I don't know what the strain is we're just going to admire the good bug because that's what it is I mean look at that stem right there just tracked which I mean that's not where you know of course you don't smoke the stems but still we're gonna get a know Gotye here guys and then we're gonna take a look at it oh let's back this up for a minute let's use well let's see here let's use this my great set this up right here prop it up I'll show you guys too snug you guys can see it is some good-looking tree you know it is some nice bud it is tracked up um definitely some fire it's real soft that's the thing that I'll noticed about this bud is that it is super soft kind of spongy but I mean not really I mean as you can see it just goes in but I'm let's put this up let's bust this open and look at the trichomes uh yeah those undisturbed trichomes you're looking real nice let's set that off to the side and just focus on in here see if it'll zoom in a little bit yeah you guys can see those try comes in there and that is the medicine that's what we're looking for and that's what we want here an hour an hour we eat on my channel mmm look at those trichomes in their guide some good-looking bud this is some Kim dog Kim dog is the father strain to some powerhouse strains like og cush and some other strain to I can't quite remember at the moment but it is a father strain to og cush and you guys all know gee coach everybody knows OG kush OG Kush came from this plant came from the string oh it's so sticky man okis and quit losing focus it's so sticky I mean just loaded up with trichomes guys this is the best bud I've ever had on this channel not gonna lie probably is the best about I've ever had but man just try it up all right guys let's get one final look at my sack here Wow I think we're gonna in this kind of a showcase this is cannabis showcase part two Kim dog oh man those trikes are just crazy alright guys I hope you enjoyed looking at my beautiful buds I got here and peace out you to stay smoking", "jIp8mNsjn20": "what's up YouTube this is oil derrick coming to you with an aggravator this is kim dog number four it's a mostly indica hybrid I'm pretty I think it's like 80% indica the smell on this one guys are so earthy so funky it's a very lemony and very piney its it's like you're in the forest it's really really funky it doesn't have a sweet or a sour taste it's it would be more sour than sweet but I don't I wouldn't really call a sour let's smoke some you break up some of these Kim dog nugs I'm just gonna bring up a boy and break nothing huge yeah myzel person whoops one can join outdoors do that you can tell it's dry this is actually really dry blood you can tell by the way the stems snap you hear that it's hanging else ready I don't know if the cameras focusing in very good or not but it's a huge nug very lime green it's got some orange hairs they're pretty light not the frosty us bud but when you get down on the interior you can see that the colors are pretty fat and it's pretty frosty like I said it's not the frost is let's see if she tastes like she smells like I said earlier the smell is really hmm it's really earthy really piney really lemony I personally am a big fan of that smell it's like really cushy not OG cushy but the real cush Girish has that real funky taste yeah that's probably not enough for a joy Hannibal it's probably enough for a joy and a little joy in a little old Rome fat mmm smell-o-vision get some of that mm-hmm it does smell a little sweeter now actually now that broken-up has a little bit of a sweeter smell but it still has that funky piney lemony earthy smell alright guys let them up oh that's powerful on the inhale it was like it was burning a little bit I swallowed I don't know if y'all saw it I swallow that's never good fighting burp that out later we had a taste amazing I had the real earthy taste real piney tastes even lemony I mean just like the

just put a few drops in there water yeah overseas it's used for human use but in New Zealand that's not at this stage [Music] we can produce it for about thirteen percent of what it costs to import the product at the moment at the moment a 30 mil bottle costs a thousand and fifty dollars for a family and it can last about a month which is a huge expense if that pathway opens up then it'd be kind of silly not to New Zealand could become world leader and weed farms in California there's quite a lot of interest I've had some issues with pesticides and other toxins in their product so they're very interested in a New Zealand product because we can do certified organic we're moving too slowly at the moment we need to accelerate that opportunity or we may miss the boat and I think the window was closing quite quickly on that [Music]", "uPfpjBKwnpA": "last November Colorado and Washington became the first US states to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Washington state legal

pot-bellied pigs are living high on the hog and becoming baked bacon but no matter what the jokes this is good business butcher William bunch Dino has experimented with feeding pigs everything from beauty bodka and now this part I know calls them his pot pigs marijuana became legal in Washington so sometime I met the growers I don't know how that happened but I met the growers you're actually witnessing history right near here hot pig pork shoulder chops and sausages has a little bit savory flavor Oh everybody's loved it I mean I'm getting stuff back on the internet now from things we've been shipping to people and they're like can't believe this that and the other I'm like wow okay Varnado takes to the streets to sell and cook his pot pig sliders amazing supporters of the pot egg

midsummer and got quite a bit of flowering out here the females have decided to make a full appearance and as I suspected some of the plants are full male like this one right here and some of the plants seem to be full female and some of the plants are hermaphroditic so we've got a combination of the 2 i'd say most of them armed aphrodite so looks like i'm going to get some seed out of this crop this year so that's uh that's making me happy and once again law enforcement is leaving me alone because I am a registered hemp farmer in this state and at the same time I'm harvesting the Rye a mano with a side old school that's the way I like things so crop is looking pretty good it's not bad for a pound of seeds got about a quarter of an acre I think I had the intention of starting out with an acre and a half but that was a little ambitious this looks more like a quarter acre so that's what I ended up with some of the insects that I've noticed so far Japanese beetles out here it's a number of other weevil like looking creatures but for the most part they just do a little bit of damage to the leaves and the plants stay pretty healthy and can withstand that level of consumption so not worried about the bugs and the deer certainly certainly been out here there's a doe with two fawns and they don't touch these things so my theory on that is a they don't know what the hell they are don't recognize them in their natural fauna and food stockpiles so they don't touch him additionally i think the the cannabis plant because of its cousin that it's psychoactive properties don't lend itself to healthy deer because a stone deer in my view is a dead deer I mean if you're a dear and you're high you're probably not going to be as worried about predators and running into cars and such not to say anything about folks who do get high he certainly used to be one of those back in high school so again just going through the field looking for anomalies plants that don't look quite right these all look like cannabis sativa hemp so far I haven't seen any plants that someone has tried to install in my fields as a frame job and some people might say well you're letting the cat out of the bag know people have been framing each other with contraband since the beginning of history so it's nothing new and I say it's going to happen and you just got to be diligent that's all because you don't want law enforcement to show up and say AHA you're growing marijuana out here disguised as industrial hemp so we can't have that so industrial have farmers beware and just be diligent get out there and be vigilant don't allow your crop to be contaminated as for the marijuana growers out there you certainly don't want any hemp farms nearby because the pollen spreads far and wide I think about two miles and sometimes bees can transport it even farther than that so if you look at nail plan i'll see if i can get this one too it's been windy so you don't have that much pollen but boy do they produce pollen anyway that's the report and get some seeds in the ground people so you can have a nice harvest later", "ziYUN64x6WM": "welcome to smokey Aston Dorgan and I am here at Ashton

friend was just texting me um you know since that one slow where I guess we'll just start on the review of that I'll put the name in the thing but this is on FX Corp or something that FX rx or whatever you want to call that company today I got some of their napalm well while ago I guess continuity doesn't exist here but um got some other napalm tangerine napalm sugar on half G I'm not gonna lie this one was very interesting in the color being really nice and on the smell definitely a nice one it almost reminds me of um sour tangi mixed with something else you know the consistency is mmm not a typical sugar it's not very granulated it's very microscopic granulated so there's a little more give but on definitely like not bad clumping on it or anything definitely easy to work with get this device turned down quick and let that cool off on its own because that was in the heating cycle got my diet dynamap right here on the d-dave mods water pipe adapter for it though that nice little glob right there on oh and if you're wondering who made that tool its use brand I guess they're very popular in the UM circle of user devices and stuff just general all-around I just cleaned this so I'm trying to make sure the outside ain't too sticky and saliva is a good breaker down a THC and all that so it's not like anyone else that's using this crap right that's set in there and this is the CEP j-hook for the diet a neom which we're going to be using and a bed once it cools down just eat this sucker up I'll say this it's very tangerine on the smell if I had to give it on like a sprite chin it tastes almost like this sour tangi on sugar like you know something like around there and it's very clean ah to say the least definitely ani it is an indica so definitely hits like an indica I mean in my testing there's really not much I can say about this like I said I paid 55 you know if you want to consider it 35 I guess because that disc kind of got on whatever item you want to put that on whenever I bought this you know that's really all I can truly say about it honestly it's not bad it's not good either it's clean so if you're looking for like one of those it's almost hits me like a hybrid but more of a sativa leaning and how it goes about hitting my body but anyway enough about this stupid thing locked the clip so that we can use the titanium just sitting right here but on the titanium going get a little more on here and I'm not gonna be lying to you guys and say I always kind of mix my stuff so like this I have like greep what was it like no nice unsaid sherbert uh-uh yeah

Solomon's lotion the extra strength one yeah that's about all I have to do right now late but I've pretty much given my some ups on those the lotions gonna probably be the last one I do because that

that's time number four hemp com please tell your friends to check it out and with that said I want to make a wonderful presentation of the interview i did with Willie Nelson back and i think it was may of nineteen ninety one so pack a bowl and enjoy today we are very honored to have a special guest on our program this gentleman has changed country music forever with his voice with the style with his singing he's also helped an awful lot of farmers across America with their plights and their heart aches and he's also brought to the public and message of hemp really realization that is backing people in Kentucky such as Gatewood Galbraith and their campaigns to just conversations on a daily basis and how we should save our planet our special guest today is Willie Nelson really thank you very much for being a guest on our show glad to be here well if you've had a chance to see firsthand the heartaches and the plights that our farmers are going through and a lot of people in their offices and driving to and from their jobs in LA in New York in Chicago don't see that the heartache that you've had a chance to witness could you could you share some of that well whenever I first started hearing about the farmers problems so i was born in a farm community in farm town a lot of my friends or farmers and so I started checking it out I heard these horror stories about farmers getting foreclosed dollar and losing their farms and bankers who were once friendly now unfriendly I heard all these things and I said well something's going on that not aware of so I started checking it out millions of farmers all over the world this country had been losing their farms at the rate of a million a year occasion phone informer's you know at one time there was eight million working farmers in this country American family farmers down now we're down to probably less than 2 million the big corporations it's the old story of the big ones eating the little ones and they're running the small farmer off the land and when that happens the farm town closes down the first thing the hospitals and the schools go and then what happens is all these people are now unemployed they move on to the next big city which causes the same kind of problems in that city I think that all the homelessness alcoholism insanity all these things that we experience unemployment in our country can be traced back to the first time the first American farmer was forced off his land when he was unable to make a living off of a hundred or to a hundred acres of land and the reason for it is because they have asked him demanded or made it necessary that he raise a crop below what he costs him to raise it he loses money on for instance if he just example figures for instance if he word it it costs him two dollars two or three dollars to plant and raise and harvest a GABA she love corn and if he only gets two dollars and fifty cents for that at the market then he's losing and this is an accepted practice in American agriculture today for the farmer to get less than what it costs him to grow and they keep trying to justify it with subsidies and whatever but the American farmer would rather go out here and work hard and make his money the hard way the way he knows how to do it give him an acre let him do what that a juror can do let him do it without all the pesticides without only chemicals don't don't put his yield so low his money so low that he has to use every piece or every gallon of pesticide that he can find to port on that acre of land in order to get enough money out to almost break even they have forced him into this position there are even banks who will not loan you any money at all unless you agree to use X amount of pesticides and chemicals on your lingo really absolutely because they know that their only way you can make your payment is if you get so much off of that acre and the only way you can get that much off of that acre is to keep pouring the chemicals to that one acre what now when did you first become aware of hemp as a cash crop a couple years ago I read a book I think that a lot of us have read by a nationally the Emperor wears no clothes and it was in that book there was a reprint of an article the the one thing in in that book that I saw that could not be argued with was an article it came out in 1938 edition of Popular Mechanics magazine februari addition if anybody wants to go check it out that said a billion a new billion-dollar crop for the farmers do you think that farmers today would be receptive to growing hemp as a cash car because of all the propaganda we've heard over the years there are so many people now who believe that it's that it's the evil weed but we we kind of figured because of all the products that it can create that it could be a solution well definitely I think most most people that I talked to had no idea just like me that hemp and marijuana was the same thing we were ignorant of that fact also we were ignorant of the fact that hemp could be used as food it can be used as clothing the first Levi's in this country were made from hemp the first Bibles were printed on hemp

everybody I hope y'all are doing good staying safe letting your voice be heard you know how it is today we have a major review coming to the channel this is something long awaited a lot of people have asked me to do it in the you know year and a half that I've been doing these reviews at one point in time this vendor used to be one of the biggest one of the baddest names in the hemp flour community and industry I can tell that this vendor doesn't have the the same juice the same market share that it once did maybe two years ago I'm talking about tweedle farms now if you around my channel you're a hip smoker yep user you might have tried tweedle farm at one point in time it was probably one of the top three biggest well-known hemp companies that there ever was know we're going into this without a bias so I went ahead I had a coupon I ordered three strains from them and I didn't want to go with any organ CBS gentle lift her sour face candy super haze nothing like that so I went and got like the three most exotic things I could find on their website and it shipped in this little box discreet came with test results and the sticker right here flowered big comb so I got a gram of each string just just a sample effect their prices aren't the greatest not the worst but it's definitely not the graves especially considering that it is all outdoor flowers I got the link WA CB star I know nothing about this strain never seen it before and purple genius now I've tried blue genius imagine purple genius is probably just a purple phenotype of blue genius but I don't know either way these are different from like the Oregon CD strangelet the regular one of the mills stuff before I start this review I want to say tweedle farms has awesome awesome customer service they're super friendly basically when I ordered the first package that they sent to me it got lost in the mail I don't know what happened point is it never got delivered to my doorstep I contacted them about it I emailed them and they got back to me so fast super friendly they're like you know we aren't responsible for packages lost or mishandled by the USPS but we're gonna go ahead and do you this courtesy and we're gonna resend that for you that's a major major Uhl plus for tweedle for tweedle farms you know good customer services like 33% of succeeding in this business I'm just gonna go on the order of the test results so it looks like we're gonna start off with the CB star okay so the CB star total THC 0.52% total CBD 13 point 12 percent all right so like I said don't know much about the strain so here goes my very very first impression of tweedle farms and flour is has a okay well first this came with an integrable tank huge plus huge bonus I love that that really improves the quality of the flour when it gets you the smell the smell is just kind of man it's got kind of like a sweet kind of minty piney smell but it's very faint so there goes that the trim job leaves something to be desired and this is a graham so I mean I wasn't expecting any big nuts but it's just kind of like compacted small tiny nut a lackluster trim job it looks like it's probably machine trimmed at the prices that they have it should definitely be hand trimmed flour yeah I don't see any seeds out right but you know if they were in here I would not be okay so far I'm not I mean I'm just I'm not super impressed by what I see this is very like I'm not I'm not I'm not liking that too much two years ago when hemp flour first came out on the scene yeah this would have been great and unfortunately it's just the bugs are just too small for me to try to get a high-resolution image they don't look very good they're kind of compact they have this a little bit of a purplish hue to them dark green let's see what kind of effects this has you know we can't make any kind of final judgement until we break it down and we get the effects go I went to break it down and this just kind of crumbled into in little pieces which really tells me I don't know if they grew this or not but what that tells me as far as that not even about the trim or anything that is just poor very Airy blood structure let's smoke it we'll see how we feel taste isn't too bad it's moderately harsh there's that kind of really initial burn and then afterwards it kind of goes away I'm gonna give this about a 7 on the the harshness scale you know it's like if I got 5 on the initial inhale and then kind of once you keep going and exhale the harshness and the burn goes away I actually experienced that in another recent review and one of my viewers actually suggests that they had a theory that that might because that might be because of flowers too moist and that's actually the water kind of boiling out and that's what's causing that initial burn and that's a really cool theory and I don't know if that's logical or if that works it sounds plausible I will have to look back into that and see if it is it's a pretty bad burn on the inhale it makes it hard to smoke anyways let me um let me kick back let's see what kind of effects the CV Starr had died we need to lay tail alright I'm back so I could feel the effects from that CD star it's a it's a heavy hybrid not very sedate of definitely not uplifting at all it's just you have the spectrum of stimulating sedating and then hybrid so it's just towards the sedating side of the hybrid I don't feel sleepy I don't feel lazy or Kawasaki but I definitely feel more sedation than I do uplifting if that makes sense so the effects are good and they're really noticeable I can feel them I can feel them strong they came on fast unfortunately I just I don't think that going with that quality of flour to get the effects that it's not worth it I mean I know for a fact you can get you know just as potent effects from far better quality flour or for far cheaper flour but I was not lost let's move on next we got the aqua poop aqua poop Quantico comes in a total THC 0.6 zero percent total CBD 15 point 16 percent so good you know good average cannabinoid levels right there it goes it won't blow okay this has a different smell but it's suffering from the same problem cuz I see you sorry the smell is very faint but you smell this in the smells like plants no doesn't smell like hay or chlorophyll or you know completely uncured freshly cut flower it just smells like it's just not very good quality flower this actually looks just like CVG a very light color the trichomes on that very the heads are very white very light yellow very very orange pistols not red pistols but very orange light ones pistols this looks and almost smells like CDG it makes me wonder they mixed up the bags at all I don't know this well this note alright well here this nut looks considerably better than the rest the nub structure is different it's more dense it has more trichome coverage the calyx formations are more in there and keep in mind all of this is kind of has that crushed by shipping problem going on once again I'm not gonna be able to like give you what it kind of great high-resolution images of this that's why I'm really trying my hardest to showcase it to right here and I don't like doing that but if there's just nothing to work with then there's nothing to work where I can I can't take pictures of crumbs of flour I understand that you know this is only a gram and that's actually probably more than gram that's robbing like a gram and a half you know to that credit that definitely looks a little bit more than a gram I don't see any seeds in this but this one didn't come with a booster an Integra pack and this one is considerably drier well now that I break it down doesn't smell like CBG at all you know CVG no matter the strain kind of has a real familiar scent to it anyways here goes the hoopla from tweedle farm that's pretty harsh yeah that's gonna be like five and a half out of ten ten being completely smooth one being like fire down your throat that's probably a five five and a half that's it's pretty hard the tapes it actually has a slightly cushy taste to it hidden behind just a general not-so-great empty so that's interesting [Music] now I actually like that taste of madness it's that's harsh so this one does have some lingering residual throat burn that's kind of hanging behind let's see what kind of effects this has and give me a few minutes and I'll come back and let you know a few minutes later all right I'm back once again this flower has some pretty potent effects I can feel the effects and I could notice them when they came in they're very similar to the CB stars kind of a sedate of leaning hybrid feel this one maybe a little bit more excited too I do feel it in my chest a little bit more I definitely do feel cloudy and foggy up here I definitely feel with this one I feel kind of stuck kind of like that ultra focus staring at things and thinking way too long type of things all definitely potent effects so far you know two out of three the effects are really good but once again I'm gonna give this the exact same you know evaluation as I did the previous strain the poor very poor quality of the flower is not worth getting to the effects that you get and I feel really crappy you know coming out here and saying I'm not trying to trash the company I have nothing against real farms they seem like extremely nice people I actually hope that they watch this video and use it to really step their game up and catch back up with the hemp game that they were like you know they were a big baller in the beginning of and they just kind of fell off anyways we got our third and final strain the purple genius now purple genius comes in at 0.37% total TAC nine point four two percent total CBD so this one's definitely lower on the cannabinoid level what this has virtually no smell whatsoever I mean I literally think I'm just smelling this envelope I'm going to show you guys what I just took out of there danger explicit you know this might be damaging to your psyche I mean this that looks this looks like Bud that I used to get in my 2006 like we used to call it a Z it was the it was the step up from like Mexican brick weed this was a Z was it was it was just kind of like backyard boogie this has almost no smell whatsoever it smells like these little paper envelopes that they come in he goes the other note right there it's compressed slightly I they just there's I can't find anything good to say about this I found a seed there's a seed right there oh well I've seen an empty calyx right there so there was another seed so this is mildly seeded as well which sucks for smoking but that is you know kind of like the silver lining because you have some genetics to grow and play with if you so choose to do that all right he goes the purple genius that tastes terrible but it is by far the smoothest of the three this is I just smoked that with no problem the biggest thing was the incredibly if in almost hitting it tastes like dirt way smoother than the first two strains of wasting with this one I'm not struggling to get it down it tastes pretty bad though taste is not pleasant at all it's unfortunate I was really looking forward to this review I was really looking forward to trying the very famed and esteemed tweedle farms I'm gonna come back in a few minutes a few minutes lay down the effects on this one are actually I don't really feel very much at all as far as the effects on this I feel probably more clear-headed now that I was going in and I don't mean clear-headed isn't like smoke some CBG or a sativa strain I mean clear head it is and my entirely 100% sober look Twitter farms I hope you're watching i'ma send you this video so I hope that you're watching it I'm speaking whoever's watching this right now forward it to whoever this concerns I'm speaking directly to you right now step your game up for your farms I don't know if y'all are sourcing this flower or if you're growing it if you're sourcing it stop that's terrible if you're growing it stop I know this is outdoor flower outdoor can be great you know outdoor can be bombed this is this is um this basically Bioman all three of these strains I know you guys have a lot more than three strings but I pick three random strains I don't know where I don't know if you grew them I don't know if your source them if you source them from where I don't know this category this grade of flower is honestly 100% best left for extraction this is not smokeable quality flower this is just eat I'm pleased like I'm I have nothing against you I just I can't believe her name as big as you if selling stuff tweedle this stuff this isn't the most expensive by far but it could I mean this this this isn't even this shouldn't even be sold for smoking I don't know and if it is this is like dollar a gram type stuff honestly and I'm sorry that I have to say this I'm really but the whole point of this channel is being honest as being transparent I'm not being biased I want to see you succeed tweedle Farms please take my advice and consideration if you're sourcing a source way better flower I don't even mean kind of better way way better it needs to be trimmed better needs to be packaged better it needs to look better smell better be way smoother the cure needs to be way better you know and this isn't even really a case of just a terrible cure this is just a case of like this is poorly grown flower I'm genuinely 100% sorry tweedle I don't want to put up you know I don't want to bring a bad reputation to your business that's not what I'm trying to do here at all I'm just being honest this is not anything that I would want to smoke again at all tweedle Farms please come back with some fire grow or source whatever you're doing way better and if you're sourcing I believe me I don't know get in contact with other farmers wherever there is much better flower out there available you know even I'm talking about outdoor machine trim flower you could get bit as better than this and just trim it up and sell it anyways I know that's the review I'm done ranting I am wearing the merch

fruity pebbles from there we got some Blue Dream white widow mine and then start with D Z so him y'all didn't know which I want to see man I want to do what y'all don't want to see you know if it's a company you want me to try out let me know again I pay for all of these none of this was sent to me I'll let you know in the beginning of any video that I do if the product was sent to me and not

for y'all to see I'm just keeping it all the way real mad like computer down so my videos are not gonna be like my previous one who I had that nice little introductions with the music YouTube was kicking my ass about the music even though I was only playing it for a few seconds in the introduction they will still hit me up so I'm cutting out the music everything and also this is for people that of the age man 18 or older this is not intended for children I'm not promoting that you go by any of this I'm just giving you my personal opinion my personal experience you take it from there and do what you do I'm not including links to anybody's websites anymore none of that you so let's check out this outdoor cyberspace can you name the open I already see like the purple and [ __ ] here this was very very nice-looking product and yes they do include these boo boo later packs in there as well so let's go here busted open man is your boy first actual flower you being back one thing to I'm not one of those people that's like I'm gonna smash something until you oh this smells like strawberries and skunks ass and a dash of pepper and all that man now I will just tell you what it smelled like a lot of CBD follow for me for my past experience at the time was smelling similar Oliver had a kind of an earthy smell some of it different you know I feel like you really got to take the nut out and bust it open and then give it the smell to really give accurate description of the smelling it from the bag a lot of the [ __ ] honestly some ever saying to me so this does have like it's kind of kind of a fruity smell but it still has an industrial kind of earthy smell that's way let's look at a note I want to see if I can guess on this purple article out it's like it so I was looking back in that bag so we got a nice one right here nice see that this hand shrieked on really worked man this is a different phone different camera that I'm using for my previous so it doesn't very clear but still not balancing and you know the clothes looks like how I like how I used to be able to do things while I'm not do apologize for that but you can get the idea [ __ ] on my table I can see very nice still moist - dance dance bird to me this is how you really tell as far as your smell busted okay now is where you get that that kind of a strong pungent kind of a dank you Smith what I mean if you've checked out they website if you guys are familiar with industrial headphones I had some really excellent prices I mean somebody product I mean you got Alice's for $40 you got $39 on some of these stuff which I have some of those I'll review for you in the future is weird much I see what that looks like on the inside and no worries I'm gonna take pictures and everything is willing to give y'all some actual pictures of of what we sing matter of fact this guy want to burn with me we're just gonna do it right now let's let's move this around I'm still here don't go nowhere

rear camera but a we're gonna make it work for the purpose of these reviews let's get you back back in focus so let's go here break this down y'all know me I smoke blunts I roll my [ __ ] I'd like to be hands-on with it so we're gonna roll one up I'm gonna smoke it and hopefully get rid this anxiety so yeah go get your swab with me break it down and do what you gotta do as far as turning and breaking it nice and moist it's not not super sticky or it's just like you know kind of labor-intensive to even break it down with with your fingers you know it's not like this so it breaks down fairly nice still does have a nice speaking this and moisture to it uh as you can see I got see from my fingers so it does have a nice texture to it and again I appreciate everybody toning means checking back in with your boy over here live is smoke session TV I know I've been away for some months but I'm back and we'll try to pump out these reviews as often as possible man but unlike

saying I definitely will do that be where I'm gonna give honest opinion so if I'm feeling and I'm feeling and I'm not gonna be one of these people that see everybody trying a particular strain and everybody say smell like strawberries and I'm gonna jump on here until you smell like strawberries if it don't you know what I'm saying that's just not me I'm gonna tell you what my honest opinion is with it whether you send it to me I pay for whatever however get it I'm gonna live it all the way raw and keep it real with my viewers because I felt like God deserved it you know it's a lot other reviewers out here now doing reviews a lot more than what it was ten months ago when I was doing mine you know it was just a handful of actual good reviewers doing it at that time so now it's a lot of people doing it I don't know if y'all doing it just for the love because y'all actually doing it I love you trying to you know just get product whatever the man may be eyeing on my cam you know I'm saying I'm gonna just let y'all know on my channel I'm gonna keep it a honey and I'm gonna let you know I'm doing this because of my depression and anxiety I am a smoke also so never forget that you know I probably been smoking for 20 years THC so I had cut back completely was done with I dabbled on it every now and then dabble in it just because there's a lot of fruit going around you know what I'm saying and then I happen to be right next to a well a recreational state now in the state of Illinois if you're I don't know has recreational night so they boom and they selling millions they breaking records I'm with a recreational sales so if I hit up the dispensary at one point once these lines not a mile long and I get something our review that is weird you know I'm saying I'll show y'all what it is I know they taxing I know they busting heads you know they charge you 20 30 dollars a gram and then the tax on it the actual state tax cuz Illinois it wasn't such a damn deficit over there with a budget man they trying to fix this [ __ ] by making this we legally ain't fooling nobody and make tax in the hell out of it over there like I'm saying somebody come out with $80 worth of product and after taxes they in the hunt is like you know down there $200 just after all the taxes like they got my actual just 30 percent THC tax not to mention just the normal state tax the local tax all the day Uncle Sam's [ __ ] which to me is crazy but to each his own we don't eat this one day that you know Sam again this is gonna be some outdoor cyberspace candy from industrial here phone let's go and do this me get one of those hemp weeks might not be saying people using them so you don't get that butane lighter taste on that first pool so I'm not hungry yeah I know no instant rating off a day off of that first pool just cuz that's all later nice smooth meat I'm sorry man I got like LCD about my blunt burn it the right way I want my blood to burn even all the way around my OCD about my blood motto you ain't choking you ain't smoking your alright so flavor wise does half still they kind of once again that kind of to me I call it like an industrial type of a flavor in that kind of earthy kind of a taste to it I am getting a very slight kind of sweetness to it like a kind of a sweet kind of a fruity kind of a taste to it it's smooth I do like it this is my first time smoking I did this bag obviously so my bad definitely not bad for the price for the service I mean I placed this order they usually [ __ ] like if you get your order let's say like that night before or early that morning they usually will ship I've gotten stuff like water like late in the evening I said if I order bait in the evening like on a Thursday little ship out Friday you know what I'm saying I haven't tried to order like early morning to see if this ships out that same day normally I'm up like late at night after work looking through my phone you know or - it looking through ready there's something and see something I like that I want to try and in our place or order for most of these companies they usually ship out then they stay I really don't have too many people that you know don't ship out usually then next day and they you know they haven't been an exception they have shipped out the next day normally get my stuff within a couple days like let's say you are to Monday you're getting it by Wednesday a Thursday as far as the sour face candy and cell please forgive me if you want to know about the specs I don't know if you'd be able to actually pause your screen and be able to scan it if you want some details I did not bring the paperwork the COA anything down here with me in the basement today so I do apologize and of course since I'm recording from the phone at this moment I can't give you guys that expects its forth like the amount you know the percentage isn't honor this so forgive me for that but if you are interested just go Hollett industrials industrial hemp forms go to their website and you'll see that I'll do a cyberspace candy on there that was a nice nice sweet flavor on the inhale across my palate I did enjoy that one thing too I'm gonna start trying to fool with these raw papers man it kind of stepped away from the blast I feel like these blunts kind of affect the flavor a little bit for me sometimes they can take away from the flavor sometimes I can add to the flavor you know I want I want to experience it maybe but I am a smoker I do like actually having something in my hand smoking so that's why I haven't ventured off in the bones or vaporizers anything like that I do have a drier vape somewhere I got to dig up and find it and charge it but the outdoors I was face candy it's definitely worth trying I definitely recommend you guys try it is again some decent looking flower will hold that up there not allowed to see they don't have any seeds in that breakdown so it's not a lot of seeds it's not a very seedy far what did they send to you they're not sending you a lot of shake anything you know you get nice birds in that bag that is a 1 ounce 1 ounce bag and again one thing when industrial hill forms as far as your pavements you can't order using the via Beal process and split your payment's up in the floor payments if there's under $300 so if you want to venture out like I did and just order a bunch of different strains we just want to get some ounces or something like that you can do that and split it up into 4 payments I remember from my previous videos I am a golfer I am a coffee you know what I'm saying I saw Duke off quite a bit that's not to say that this is horses isn't horse at all that's not like a horse flavor it's my hidden you liked it I just seem to choke wear another stuff when you choking and you know you get mad lack of oxygen you're kind of boosting that feeling a little bit as well you kind of feel those effects just from the fact that you all kind gagging I'm saying so as far as the feeling let's get this video off I want here 25 minutes on that day feeling back here I honestly thought it my slow feeling kind of in the back of my head as not really feeling heavy I'm not really feeling too much of an effect up here but it takes a lot for me with my eggs and everything and the way my mind races it takes a lot to actually get me going mm-hmm but I am having a kind of a here feeling kind of in the back of my head starting to creep up on me a little bit and I'm feeling relaxed I'm milling what now you know what I'm saying if you all can tell just from watching me interacting with you guys in this video as I'm smoking I'm kind of starting to mellow out a little bit I'm probably talking to more [ __ ] much so it's working you know what I'm saying I'm not feeling that anxious racy bubble good kind of feeling you know what I'm saying that people that suffer from it will know what I'm talking about I'm not feeling that tightness in my chest you know so it it is you know it is helping so again check them out industrial hemp forms I do I saw was face candy I put some pictures up as well check out my Instagram smoke session TV I got some great pictures inside the bag of this [ __ ] looking extra purple man it's hard to tell from here you can kind of see it but it is a lot of purple in that bag if you found a purple like myself I don't know why I just love it if I feel like if it look purple and that [ __ ] must be some heat but that's just my opinion probably has nothing to do with it the bluntest one now so that means it's time to end this video as far as a dry heat though you do get that even sweet kind of the sweetness off of that soluble space can and that's why I really enjoy start with spaced handy as an overall strain it has a very distinctive smell", "bH7CuNhb3Ms": "now here's your farm and ranch report from the Montana AG Network good Tuesday morning everyone it's time for today's farm and ranch news and as we look to those AG headlines here on this Tuesday we see that Montana continues to lead the nation in industrial hemp production with more than 40,000 acres planted here in 2019 but there are still hurdles that hinder farmers in Montana and across the nation Senator John tester has penned a letter to the Financial Crimes enforcement network on updating its hemp related guidance testers demanding that they comply with federal law and cease prohibiting local banks from accepting funds related to hemp farming and businesses FinCEN is among the last regulators to implement year old laws allowing farmers to produce hemp their delay has prevented many financial institutions from banking hemp due to fear of enforcement action from that organization tester is urging the entity to cut red tape barriers for the nation's hemp farmers and businesses so they can succeed financially here today and in the future looking to other headlines now the explosion at Cargill's Dodge City Kansas processing facility that occurred last week has only temporarily shuttered operations at the plant the explosion was at a building that processes blood into blood meal a feed additive and not at the main facility two workers were injured in the blast but the company expects their cattle receiving aspects to be fully back up and running here starting today since the explosion cattle ready for harvest are being sent to Cargill facilities this does come as USDA continues its investigation into possible market manipulation after the Tyson beef plant fire in Kansas occurred this past September

the Census Bureau and asking to enter livestock and poultry barns illegally while census workers are currently out gathering information the animal Agra Lions wants producers to be wary real census workers should be willing to provide proper identification and should not be entering barns or other bio secure areas the census.gov website lists how to identify a rail census worker to further verify the visitors identity use the staff directory to find contact information for individuals supervisors or contact the regional office if the workers seem to be legitimate but asked to go into

smoky bar or restaurant or whatever and having to buy a bunch of junk instead they just come here they get seated opposite each other in a bed of vegetables and they weed together in that bed and for two to three minutes and then we stopped the watch move up half of them down the line the other half stay where they're at so they get hooked up with everybody on down the line I think I was probably a year ago I was in a National Public Radio and I heard a very small story about a farm and mean that started doing something called weed dating and there the idea behind it was that and their experience meeting they realized that you really get to know people when you're you know weeding a row together and so they decided to start something that you know was like the concept of speed dating and I thought what a brilliant idea so I have I'm friends with Lori Bevan and Casey O'Leary and they have Earthly Delights farm so I forwarded them the story from NPR and they both embrace the idea and liked it and and here we are so I work at a local restaurant that focuses on on using local food and and in connecting with our farmers in our local community so I personally by do all the food buying for the restaurants um I'm really connected to the local local farmers local producers I think it makes a huge difference especially during the summer when you have fresh produce it's just better for you it's better it's a better quality product you know something that comes from your environment that you're eating seasonally it's just better cutter for you you know we could get into like the the environmental impact of it the the carbon footprint the things like that but you know we really feel strongly about supporting our community supporting local farmers and getting back to

happy to be here with you again on a erratic basis and we're going to smoke up and chat about some cannabis subjects live for you this evening yeah thanks for joining us for another show Dunedin campus club and we're going to be covering all the news politics in views from the world of cannabis and we've got a special guest Angela here has a very good thanks for joining us so tonight we're going to be talking about a couple of different things we've got some footage from the hemp fields to show you it is hemp farming season and anybody who's interested in this wonderful resource can get their legal license from the government and get those seeds in the ground will be showing a little video of some of the hemp seed planting process a little bit later and we'll talk about the licensing process we're also going to be talking about the recent program looking at synthetics and the issues surrounding animal testing and human testing of synthetic cannabinoids and natural cannabis medical products we're also going to be talking about the shock decision to deny subsidized funding for Sativex all that and more coming up on Bonita in cannabis club but what is the main purpose of why we're here and why we broadcast Julian and one of the viewers going to see us doing in just a minute here well we're here to promote the legalization of cannabis of course it's a policy that's long overdue in this country and 10 all around the world and we're going to engage in some civil disobedience and we're going to consume some cannabis as an act of protest and you can do the same home if you want to join the protest and engage in civil disobedience feel free to smoke up while you're watching this and we're going to have an Ag review where we bring you a review of a different nugget show and this week's no different so we're going to partake in the hood it sounds the most easy approach testing of your dad I think mmm very easy protease yeah in fact it's a it's one of the few protest movements still very active a lot of other protest groups are you stupid or negative this one keeps his mask 82 Garrett well and it's not very well known I'm speaking of cannabis let's partake shall we it's not very well known but a lot of people lament the state of protest movements on university campuses around Anita University of Otago around New Zealand University of Otago in Dunedin is no different and there used to be a heyday you know sort of in every decade protests about a different thing the right of males and females to share a flat together against the actions of the vietnam war against the Springbok tour against introducing fees on university but you know since the 90s there hasn't really been a lot of high-profile protest activity except for one thing there's only been really one big protest of any size on the Otago campus in the 2000s and that was in fact a cannabis protest reacting against the infiltration of undercover police at the behest of the university to try to shut down the 4 20's and of course the 4 20's as a protest movement well not always huge in numbers persistence over a decade 12 years now as certainly yeah an achievement you can always find out more about the whole protest movement down the cannabis museum of ulterior [ __ ] mana and that is at 66 David street in caversham so plenty of information down there if you're in Dunedin she kept the cannabis museum now at the cannabis museum recently we have undertaken some creative funding attempts mostly in the form of a guest room on the popular air B&B platform and I think we can thank you for a lot of success there Angela tell our viewers you know what they can expect him speak well lately Oh was looking at Shea me when I first got here exercise but it looks really great now it's like a home away from home I'd like to say and you've got access to the risk of the building is a kitchen area and lounge obviously and big dreams got a lovely at to wrong man big beard it's got example bit and outside we have a large garden that you can have it wake it as well and what else is this quite a minute isn't really kosher this as a sparkle which can be used yes right home it's very large three gigabit broadband Wi-Fi Wi-Fi throughout the whole house dairies really close you've got the public you've got 15 chefs you've got a lot of great antique shop actually our most recent guess that's meant I haven't been a year yeah well it's new and apparently there's some great deals and caversham you know isn't underappreciated an historic neighborhood and denied a and we have had a lot of feedback from tourists now with the Airbnb with with the museum in the first place we were always New Zealand's only legitimate cannabis-based tourism operation and now we're at New Zealand's only legitimate canada-based accommodation operation and it's very popular and we've had a lot of feedback from not only the guests but the local businesses as well that we're bringing economic activity to de need an end to caversham specifically people have told us that they weren't even planning to come to Dunedin on their itineraries but because they saw the cannabis museum was there they had to make a stop and now that there's the opportunity to stay why not stay a few days and in fact our latest air B&B guests was going from Christchurch to walk the milford track and he wasn't even going to stop and de need anybody thought that the drive to Tiana from Christchurch was too long then he saw the cannabis museum and he stopped for a night but headed to way straight the next day but he had so much fun while he was here that he's decided to come back to Dunedin and change his itinerary book a couple of extra days spend time spend money in the caversham neighborhood and further afield and so on it's really a big addition to the Dunedin tourism portfolio there's not a lot of rainy day activities in donita you know for the adult enthusiasts but even this is a good place to just come and relax and chill out and just maybe take a little bit bright really well I've also haven't described to me by guests as a sanctuary a refuge a home away from home my new batch in Dunedin um it is that is a cozy place there's a crazy fights I like that and here's a good atmosphere chickadee on airbnb com and to search for [ __ ] amana the cannabis museum nice $55 a night which is a great deal you know not only for your own room and all these facilities projector Wi-Fi heaven by itself yes exactly yeah plenty of heat and and you get the place all to yourself and you know uncertain evenings you know you might have people like us knocking around in another room doing a crazy live talk show where we smoke up in protest or vaporized in this case hey you know hey baby with us yes that's right there's plenty of space for everyone but if you do enjoy witnessing those type of antics there's ample opportunity for that as well so let's move on to synthetics you know we hear a lot about them they're back their new they're worse than ever the gangs control them now they're even harder than they were in the past and this is all because well in the first place the government went through this convoluted process of trying to stop you know do anything they could to avoid legalizing cannabis even going so far as to legalizing synthetics you know to prevent having the discussion about legalization of natural cannabis now the idea was they were going to be tested for safety now instead the government just banned them very abruptly before the election and then they decided that they weren't going to allow animal testing now you know a lot of people are against animal testing for reasons of animal welfare but the problem is that the government basically created a catch-22 scenario they said you have to test these products to the level of a pharmaceutical but you can't use animal testing but if you are testing the fire Seussical you must use animal testing so we're in the strange situation now where synthetics cannot be tested on animals but the medical cannabis that they're talking about maybe allowing trials of must be tested on animals so you know if they you know if people patients want access to medical cannabis then they have to have it tested on animals but if you no synthetics manufacturers want to present other low-risk psychoactives they can't test it on animals and over in America medical cannabis products that are intended for animals are being tested on humans how is that happening yeah well it's so the pharmaceutical were raging Peter Dunn wants to follow here in New Zealanders is so strict and of course as part of us pharmaceutical regime they have animal testing and it's going to be interesting to see whether the animal rights groups kick up as much fuss as they did for the synthetics animal testing there could be a whole new round of protest to that save the puppies and you know Peter Diane's trying to kill puppies and TC drugs on puppies well but in this case you know this is something that could benefit them I think the problem people have the synthetics is it was no benefit and it was obviously harming humans with medical cannabis people want to give it to their animals you would like to give it the black community cares my case she's got very bad arthritis well that's right men where they have a much better system in the US where they are giving it to animals now and yeah I've heard a lot of read a lot of articles about people being having preparations to go to the animals I fan is great um she likes getting starring anyway that's a cover-up I she embraces them quite regularly but without having a stripper pharmaceutical regime it's a much better system yeah because humans can access medical cannabis straight away without needing to be tested on animals and animal yeah animals that use cannabis i first tested on humans it's just he's just throwing something else only we know it's safe because studies have been done but because I've been done overseas he's saying that they're not it's not enough information whereas other pharmaceuticals coming to the country and it's enough that without been tested overseas and he's just sitting up this ridiculous double standard there it's why should you animus be forced to enter the pharmaceutical so yeah brought out a circle system is a whole another system panetta medicines and cannabis could be treated as a natural medicine I think that's the interesting because it is recreational and pharmaceutical so some pharmaceutical preparations will be needed for people who don't want to just smoke or vapor or something well maybe they can make it more specialized with different thanks for the trouble is that the pharmaceutical companies have a vested interest in keeping cannabis illegal because it can help treat a lot of diseases that the other drugs are currently being used for so once they and I think that's still going to look at things and develop things not me so you can patient it you know but um I think I have a problem with that if they're going to put the hard weekend like there's some stuff we can't just boil up well I think the the interesting thing about the you know the debate that you're having gonna meet bars if you're left a guard plants and you think yeah and Keith exactly joint is not gonna be good enough fine but a few hey you don't want to go plants in your background you can and you need maybe need something a bit more specialized but they're not mutually exclusive and that's the important thing the debate we're having here in New Zealand is pharmaceuticals only yeah the expensive home growing and natural for those who have benefit more there's no problem with it and that way some people make money and some people don't have just been many before yeah I think you can have both what Peter Dunne's doing with the pharmaceutical regime is another form of prohibition he's using it to prevent anything get approved you know like he doesn't want people to use home growing up or try now over when the state's is a whole new industry of scientists developing each strength and cannabinoid preparations and there's a whole lot of scientific testing well I must not forget that most of the greatest scientific discoveries here in New Zealand have been in someone's backyard in their back shed including jet packs so you know let's not underestimate the key I why D the Kiwi DIY ethic number 8 wire especially when it comes to cannabis we know they've done well overseas in the Dutch seed banks and speaking of seeds hemp farming season is upon us and a hemp license is something that anyone can do you the viewer can do and tell us about the hemp licensing process how do people get ahem places and you know what are the basics and they can get in touch with us at the Museum if they're interested so you can apply for a license through the Ministry of Health and it takes about two months to get the license so you want to apply well before the planting season so hemp is generally planted and around the october november time so you want to be getting your license and around well before August or so and if you've got a good bit of farmland that you want to be grown in on then you simply fill out the form we want to grow it and ideally you want it to be hidden from public view in some sort of rural area and then it's about five hundred dollars to get the license and as I said it took about two months and the case of the one we're going to be watching a video of they recently got the license in the implant of the seeds straight away which were purchased locally so it's definitely quite possible when more and more people are taking up the opportunity of him because of its economic potential and we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of some seed planting and get to ride along if you will with a license holder and this local farmer and it was a really great experience it's a great craft just the the look in the field and the act of farming is very transformative and liberating but the crop itself has so many uses doesn't it oh absolutely yeah I mean the food the seeds are used as a food source it's very high in protein and meeting at my house shop and that I cancel so anymore that's right there's any one bag keep the seed or protein a departing the protein powder yeah yeah shops I think that's been selling that just don't like cancel so anymore and it's quite papacito yeah well the seed of course is legal for consumption of animals yeah but not for humans only in Australia and New Zealand blood it's illegal to grow hemp in America yeah in most states but it's legal to eat the seed for food and it's legal to grow hemp in New Zealand but it's illegal to eat the seed for food you know if if you press the seed into oil that's legal for human can sumption in New Zealand but not Australia but all of its legal for animals and these farmers that we're going to see they're actually growing the seed for pressing into oil and they're going to feed some of the seed to animals and some of the by-product to animals and of course you can also get the fiber from the stock as well as the herd material which is good for building products I liheap great and it's also useful for the likes of biofuel and even bio plastics and things like that so many advanced products can be developed from from the natural hemp plant so now we're going to take a look at a short clip of some hemp farming in action sowing the seed and hopefully we'll be able to provide you hereunder needing cannabis club in future episodes with some footage as the crop is growing and maturing and you'll get to see for yourself but it all starts out with planting the seed yeah great yeah yeah yeah then you got me show you the seat and we can ever about what we're going to be sewing rates when they will set stuff up girl every choice um I mean he's got the stuff you never write let's David yeah yeah yeah okay yes let's trip d t dress what do you mean well what's been done the to be run through a plot and all the rubbish is at all chaff at all the seed boys yep are you getting a knot on to exit well this is gone sorts of stay exactly where yeah so so small seeds we've all those little yeah it's got large sea and it's got other it's in between butters easy he really hasn't been dressed okay dresses nice Tony speaks that's fine suppose what you guys keep out help achieve ever it's basically the point but it's all I want Ron yeah mr. Grover commit yeah so and some through the stroke yeah yeah what on things like yeah calibration baby another good Thomas sorry give would be yeah maybe like it's not a notice oh we just do one rock yeah and then I don't think well we apologize for the audio problems that we had in the video but the audio wasn't the main part of it anyway you got to see the pictures of the heap being so in the air and you know it was really good experience being up there on the farm and just seeing the seeds go in the ground it's very very productive you know and hopefully there's going to be some good economic development coming from there yeah and um as you say you know it was just it was just a really fun experience like getting on the farm having stuff before not really i mean i've been on farms like as a kid but actually i'm operating the machinery and like doing it all from start to finish pretty fun yeah I'm have you been on you from love it I swing down a trap right I've seen a large one in march away Carrie and I've seen a large one and the Waikato region and I've been involved with growing hit myself as well and the small scale and to it this is the second time I've been directly involved you know I mean not yeah not as the licence holder but someone who's given advice and so on oh cool and just like tell us about your farming background angel oh my family background uh my parents had deer found at one stage that was pretty cool what's it to you nice watch this is not that was a lot did you do any like cropping though like no I'm sewing there's really running your hands through the seed yeah miss Adams I'm feeling yeah scatting really that piece you getting such as well but now I am pig cropping well that brings us to a favorite part of the show the Naga reviews and it's a bit difficult to do consistent nug reviews in Dunedin and we're going through a bit of a dry patch at the moment but um we did manage to sort of squirrel away some tiny tiny morsels at McKinnon Jay where were you and this comes from the central north island region yes really and hey let's just give it a go hmm we would you say fancy if you like fancy areas well it's all about who you know you know every every region has not like someone was fancy marijuana yeah and if you can meet them or a very lucky person oh yeah it shouldn't have to be that luck question it really you should just be able to go look but I must say to all of those you know all of the viewers out there who may be that that person in their region who has the good stuff um as New Zealand's only cannabis museum at sort of our responsibility to sample and get along all these different varieties so we can only encourage you to you know submit your samples we excited well academically preserve them in the historical place they deserve taipei maybe the beasts paper toy review tables wait you mean using well I'm not going to say we're the best but I will say we will do justice to historical archive of the you know importance to cannabis culture that um you know New Zealand home cultivators have provided over the years thank you can provide in it that trust yeah give them that trust in your good confidence oh we're talking to each other yeah we will responsibly review responsibly just as you see here and so what are your thoughts what are your thoughts on that durban poison i believe from the central north island during i see it's very smooth tasting and obviously being durban poison it's a strong sativa dominant and very uplifting you know i'm a big fan of durban poison so it's really good yeah I always appreciate it because it's not not every day you get to smoke Durban what would you give that out of a 1000 no I have another Pam just to make sure maybe an 8 out of teen direct dep have you guys been taping and okay well you know we're always open to suggestions and we do want to develop this professional nug review service I'm gonna end up with some kind of winner at the end of the year mmm that's right and we can join in Detroit pitcher well I don't race you know I don't think today yeah they might be able to claim it at the Museum or we might just display it at the Museum you know with an engraving yeah they might not want it to be one group of students write the name of the tip of the necklet one yeah that's really pay too late yeah well it's been a while since New Zealand has had a proper cannabis cup of course I'm the now defunct normal New Zealand organization used to host a cannabis cup and the Hauraki Gulf you attended one of those never know you never attended us but they used to have a boat they went out on it sounded very nice I mean the cannabis cup on a boat so maybe we'll have to look into that idea and get the cannabis cup revived because you know there's plenty of potential to you know get it hit me much time true that well let me just pack up this other little portion here and we'll see if we can come to a consensus so what else has been happening in the world of cannabis and cannabis lari from what can viewers look forward to Canada has sort of our guarded the wheels in motion hmm that's right yeah the Prime Minister and Justin Trudeau has issued a directive to the Minister of Justice and instructing them to start a process of legalizing cannabis so formulating the framework of regulations and how it's all going to work in it's great to see the ball is rolling straight away as promised by the Liberal Party to legalize cannabis nationwide on Canada so are sticking to that promise in legalization is beginning in Canada and also in Mexico beautiful look right they already have cancer in the active engine but south of the US and Mexico there's signs of legalization as well yeah stirrings I think if you will the am supreme court and this guy has come out and see it cannabis is a human right and it's a human right to grow it but they need this baby skills they need five more people to bring similar cases and I think that won't take long yeah that's a pretty groundbreaking decision by the Supreme Court and Mexico that canvas is a human right not only to disease and use cannabis but you also have the right to grow up because if you're going to if you're going to be given permission to use it you have to have a legitimate way of obtaining it so it's great that people are going to be able to grow it on the near future over a mitigator did we talk about the cervix pendant yeah we don't and I'm really back and disappointed about it so sativex is a pharmaceutical preparation of cannabis but a whole extract of you know purebred cannabis strains that have a known ratio of THC and CBD formulated into a mouth spray delivered kind of by asthma inhaler under the tongue I'm just like like I'm mouth spray like mens rea Lee yeah yeah um and it costs a thousand dollars a month yeah to use it hmm and our thousand dollars a week approximately fourteen hundred dollars a month it depends how much you're using how much pain you yeah and pharmac was looking at subsidizing it so that you know people who really needed it could be getting it hang the five dollars yeah great that's been taken seriously people made does medicine and there's a lot of people who do need it and could benefit from it but they don't bother applying because they know the columns dan has come out and bein lat well no one's applying for it so obviously don't need that back people don't apply for it because it it's like it's yeah a lot of hurdles of Peggy work and no one wants to [ __ ] take it i was going to apply for something they can for them something that you can fall in the first place so but if i were to be subsidized then a lot of new people would apply for it oh my god Ben large be ripping one of the only very bad new paint in my face and nerve painter is one of the things that we know our cannabis is amazing for and so I have very bad side effects from the opium medicine I feel visit ah nope it's obvious that i have to take to control my pain so i could take a cameras product instead and not feel awful and but still have my pain management lee hmm why how do i do that yeah well it's a real catch-22 situation because if it was legal you could just produce your own set of X alternative yeah there's mcdonalds Fallon that's the reason well that adds efforts money the reason why as mine education free and what was the decision that was handed down it was looking like they may actually subsidizes and Peter done it himself trotted out this argument in the media just a few years ago saying canvas with preparations and if its safety yay and don't you know and don't make the argument that sativex is too expensive because we're looking at subsidizing it right now yeah what decision today please come back when oh well I don't think me that the people not viewing it came back with that um people who want to smoke it recreationally might get their hands on it and how's it and therefore go get a thousand sighs it's okay and this is the sixth expert advisory committee to farm active strongly come out against subsidizing it because it has the potential for recreational yourself extremely concerned just pray that to tell me that I can do something is gonna change my life quite dramatically well them good to tell me I can't use this just like [ __ ] you I just can't play someone else yeah because some junkie might abuse it instead you have to stay on which has never ever been which has never ever been recreationally diverted yeah they want the junkies to stay on the opiates they don't want you know this increased access to medical cannabis and the thing that people don't understand you know when Peter Dunne talks about specific products when it comes to medical cannabis any product any medical preparation can be made out of any cannabis transdermal patches Oilers space it's the strain it's the strain of canvas trying to see is the product so any of those products can be made they can may be made in the pharmaceutical lab they can be made in the home in the shed maybe your shed is a lab and maybe you would make it into a lab if you were growing cannabis what set of Excel strain of waiting is onion going to be one strain it needs to be mostly dry mission we go back why should it baby any option well in the US models in the mini states that allow medical cannabis the doctor prescribes it and they prescribe specific strains and then the patient can take whatever product whatever form of ingestion suits their condition suits you know where they have the symptoms the delivery method that's best very and the one that agrees with them and it's the strain that is the product and you need to know the specific strains in the best way to have the best access to strains is to allow that you know boutique niche organic home growing individuals entrepreneurs at every level and that's what they've got over there that's what I think we should have over here and you know it sounds like the people who are putting pushing this pharmaceutical agenda you know may have finally come to the end of that mission so let's hope that that's true and let's hope that we can move forward you know with a holistic meaningful change for medical cannabis and you know that might just have to come about via a referendum or something like that but uh it's been great being with you we've smoked a lot of cannabis we've talked about a lot of [ __ ] and we're going to smoke a little bit more cannabis and now you know to sign off the show we're just going to have some parting words and a parting cone and we'll show you our favorite our favorite tourist advertisement for a [ __ ] amount of cannabis museum you know and if you you like what you see if you like what you hear visit us at [ __ ] went on a cannabis museum down there in Dunedin 66 David street caversham have you guys got any parting words for the viewers hmm garlic at the facebook page [ __ ] argument w wh AKA ma na yep and keep up to date with the news from cannabis called da teensie bit wwan organs ed have you talked about that what happened with kelly going what happened le van gallon yeah no one knows no I reserve but they want well right exactly we know that the judgment was reserved how long ago this is this was over a month ago and we were supposed to hear about this and nobody heard about this so what options does that leave right i mean presumably there's been suppression quite obviously there's been suppression because you know if it was a normal reserve judgment we would have heard within days and since we haven't heard in a month it must be suppressed and if she was still in jail I don't think they would suppress her and if she was out of jail and it was just they had decided to free her I don't think it would be suppressed either because she would be free so what do you think well I think that'll the only option left is that they're somehow its ongoing that they plan to relitigate it and they don't want anybody talking about it that's the only option that I can see but we don't know and we'll never know I mean we've got to find out where is the media on this chinen with your conspiracy theory free Kelly and check out Pokemon a cannabis museum and check out this ad for our latest edition and thanks for joining us on dunedin cannabis club club stop by

marijuana when of dunedin first Kendra's law reform movements in the mid-70s this collection of vintage rolling papers is a must see so stop by the canvas museum in Tunisia and", "I7plEJHP3WI": "hey guys welcome to the Washington State cannabis review I'm gypsy [ __ ] and today we're gonna be talking about Cedar Creek cannabis now Cedar Creek cannabis is a farm located out in Clark County in Vancouver Washington now these guys were voted the best growers of Clark County in 2016 and in 2017 these guys are an indoor grow facility they Institute an organic pest management system so these guys in other words are using organic pesticides and predatory insects as well to protect the crops now there but is pot soil grown now I've said this in some of my other videos but what I mean by that is there but is grown in a type of a potted hydroponic system and they also hand trim all their bud as well now the strain that we're going to be reviewing from this particular farm is going to be called the chem dog now its lineage has been a mystery due to continuous breeding and crossing of the strain over the years but what we do know from this strain is that it's highly sought-after in the medical community for daytime relief in strain in stress depression anxiety and lack of appetite so with all that being said I'm really excited and I can't wait to see what these guys have to offer so we'll get right back to you [Music] hey guys welcome back to the review portion of our segment we're gonna crash through the four basic food groups of our review the smell look taste and overall hi now to start off with the smell I gave it four and a half stars they had a sweet and earthy and it had a hint of pine to it now for the look I gave it five stars it had everything you were looking for in your butt it had nice density frosty trichomes inside and out and had beautiful orange hairs all around it for the taste I gave it four and a half stars it had a sweet and piney and a hint of earthiness to it so it kind of you know it would have been a five it was a little more sweeter now for the overall high I gave it five stars it was very creative I had a nice mental relaxation it was I would say it's I had a nice subtle body effect and you know be something I would think would be great for camping or hiking or even working out or something like that or even homework or things like that if you have to do schoolwork or things like that so anyways I'm gypsy [ __ ] and I'm signing out", "mJr2_Dj3NrQ": "love you too so this is the end of job I did on there to follow all these here oh we're all that this chick or nah I left this on one here because it's right in the middle and I mean look that's enough you can see if it's showing over you but it's I think it's all right anyhow I just cleaned up that's the canned dog here's the pineapple pineapple chunk from a Barney's farm and then have too much to clean honor to couple things down at the bottom you see here give it a few couple little things here and there and I'll here they're one here you know a couple of things is cleaned up now on this one I didn't really do too much because since I'm doing this I really want to see where these are going to say I'm hoping that this whole if I should've done this earlier so this can set up anyhow it's all going to come up I know well done it before not with this strain particularly but anyhow then here's yes super Lemon Haze sorry but the lines guys we topped her I got a video on that did some head hunting with it so that'll be nice no so check that i'll show you the event real quick what's going on alright so here we have this is probably my last Devil's Throat right there man I wanted to push her out all nice and get her all bushy and she's doing pretty well doing real law I think she's going to do pretty good as a little bush CC mix or a black water I check it out it's a little hot such a lot anyhow check them all jamming he said those scum cases you can see the new growth right here and there this is all new all this up his new look at that oh yeah that's all new not exactly sure what's going on with this actually throwing out a few pistols or no oh no no it's not it's just full of salt but half eaten it no worries and her this is all the girls it's good you're doing good ain't no me I appreciate those man you'll see you'll see male and I go up north it's not going to be this this [ __ ] of [ __ ] 91 degrees too that's for sure and i'll be coming down here so we'll get to smoke on that bro you know who you are there's an early girl what is this critical plus nice nice jamming out don't explain what's this Giga bud all right you know take it shoot guys I well you know what I'm just going to have to wait for it to finish Curie I've come to the realization that you know you really you know it's really worth it just to kick back and cure oh man you know you're better off sitting there then the cure and seeing what you get out of it anyhow hey this is from my buddy I think this is the other devil's food this is for you I've been doing that top and pushing it off like trying to get it similar to this one or like that one you said you'd like that so try to do something with that you know how to bring it over to your spot whenever whatever you want bro I'll be ready he's doing pretty good looks like that one I said this girly girl right there could use some water anyhow all right just want to show you guys youtube job going peace out", "KXCGAK5_juI": "TWO TREES CAME DOWN. THERE WERE DOWNED POWER LINES AND FIRES AROUND THE CITY. NOW TO A MAJOR BUST. LAW ENFORCEMENT SAID 10 MILLION PLANTS WITH $1 BILLIONS WERE SEIZED. HAS MORE.

IF THEY DO THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW RULES SO THEIR PRODUCT CAN BE INDUSTRIAL HEMP.", "1TTG2V_Z79k": "David Monson grows wheat barley and canola on 700 acres in osnabr\u00fcck a little town in the northeast corner of North Dakota but wheat has sometimes been a problem cropped for farmers in recent years we were hit with a disease in our wheat called fusarium headblade when we got to harvest time there was nothing in the heads and we had never seen anything that bad before so Monson who's also a Republican state legislature wanted to help farmers find a way to switch to another cash crop he happened to read about him it was talking about industrial hemp legislation being introduced in other states including Minnesota and in many other states and it talked about how Canada was raising it now and how much profit they could make on it and all that one reason for the interest is that HAMP is so versatile there are more than 25,000 uses ranging from food to fiber it was part of our everyday lives for centuries American farmers including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp and in fact in North Dakota remnants of that activity are still evident today in what is called ditch weed today which is nothing more than wildly growing industrial hemp it was encouraged as part of the war effort because it was a strategic material over the decades hemp was looked at in a different way the leaves are similar to the marijuana plants so they're often confused both plants are from the species Cannabis but hemp contains virtually no THC the active ingredient in pot still it became illegal in the 1930s only to have the band relaxed briefly for military use during World War two in the 1970s it became classified as a restricted drug but that didn't deter Dave Monson I said if they can do it in Canada and England and Germany all of the world we should be able to do it too just 25 miles over the border Canada passed a law in 1997 become one of more than two dozen countries allowing the licensed growing of industrial hemp Manitoba produces nearly half of the 12,000 acres planted in Canada but you see your paddle not the seed out into a hand Andrea Herman is with the Canadian hemp trade alliance an umbrella organization for the industry she says her country's interest in the crop began in 1992 when a group in Ontario looked at successful cultivation efforts in Europe and some producers there and some governmental officials decided that this was an opportunity for Canada to recognize an industrial crop that could be grown on agricultural basis adding to crop rotation and crop diversity and also product diversity how tall will they get when they're ready to harvest 06 8 feet tall Kent Oatway is one of those Canadian farmers to venture into hemp production now why did you want to start growing it oh I guess we like to try new things a bit and who is interesting and the price was fairly decent for the product farmers like can't operate under strict government regulations that include a criminal background check before receiving a license currently Canada grows 12,000 acres of him you can see many plants right along the highways it's an easy crop to grow especially on land that's also good for weed and corn the crop is harvested at different times for different products seed products are picked by combine most of the hemp grown in Canada is grown for hemp seed which is then processed into oil and meal the two largest plants are located right here in Manitoba hemp oil Canada's facility may be small but it is north america's largest producer and processor of hemp both fiber and oil for things like food clothing soaps and paints we contract with farmers to produce hemp seed for us across the Canadian Prairies we then bring it in and process it here and seeing a gap in to hemp seed oil hold him seat or shelled hemp seed some of the products like the ones Purdue by hemp oil Canada can be found in a variety of stores and specialty shops like hemp in the heartland in Sacramento California Kyle it's amazing all of the things that use hemp definitely we carry clothing food paper products you know hempfield something like four times more paper per acre than wood pulp so it's an incredible alternative the u.s. is one of the biggest markets for hemp items Dave Monson hopes one day to supply the crop in 1999 North Dakota became the first state to legalize hemp cultivation and Monson was the first to receive a state license he still can't grow it however because the law also requires federal approval so far that hasn't happened which means North Dakota farmers will keep up efforts to someday get the crop into their fields camp has played a role in world commerce for thousands of years the plant was originally cultivated in China to make rope as well as fishnets hemp was widely grown for use in papermaking early in America's history in fact the Declaration of Independence is written on parchment containing hemp fibers it could be a multi-trillion dollar industry had it kept going from the early days if it hadn't been outlawed because of its relationship to marijuana his dream is now one step closer to reality a bill that would allow the growing of industrial hemp just passed the state assembly a committee it will permit the growing of hemp as an eight year pilot program in kern kings and san joaquin counties a number of law enforcement agencies are against the plan they say growers can easily hide marijuana and hemp fields bringing more crime to the area Meyer says this is the case you can't go marijuana in a hempfield it would get pollinated by the male plants and the ceased to produce the THC or well it wouldn't produce it at all sheriff's offices and Kings kern and san joaquin counties didn't want to comment on the issue at this time there's no doubt in Wayne Howie's mind hemp should be a crop that is part of North Dakota's future we've been going peas and lentils chickpeas various other types of crops over the years I think hemp will certainly be a nice rotational crop it would fit in well he feels so strongly about it mainly because of the potential he sees in it everything in front of him samples he requested is made from hemp much to my surprise about three weeks ago I received three boxes in the mail three really big boxes of various products from manufacturers across the entire United States there were others we could have shown you but unfortunately I can't provide you a lot of samples because these products taste too good and have you eaten an awful lot of these oils lotions food milk like products and more all made from hemp the silk and hemp is extremely soft very pretty looking I can see some girl in about three years making a prom dress out of this stuff but for that to happen in North Dakota the federal government stance on the crop must change a lawsuit brought against the feds was recently tossed out and North Dakota's congressional delegation has decided not to pursue it in Congress but huggie still continues his push looking to generate support hopefully at some point there will be a sufficient demand not only in North Dakota but in other states across the entire United States to a point where we can join the rest of the industrialized world and start growing some of these products and he hopes North Dakota is a key player in doing just that that's my goal I guess just to get area person's thinking about it", "sjGWTHDi9XI": "next on meet the farmer TV we talked with two plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Monsanto the companies that have these plans on our food have had a you know over 20 years to make billions of dollars they can throw at anything we do to try to change the situation and the only way it's going to be is going to be something like in the civil rights movement this program is a production of meet the farmer TV LLC in association with planet Earth diversified Nelly productions and Leslie Jacobs photography and graphic design so here we are we're going to talk to a couple plaintiffs in the Monsanto lawsuit so Arab I know you from the seat exchange but how did you get started in this this court case well gosh while southern exposure seed exchange we were approached about joining in this lawsuit against monsanto and we've been you know raising the issue of transgenics and how it affects us because we're a seed company where we're at risk of having contamination and this lawsuit came along and it seemed like the right thing to do to become a part of trying to stand up against monsanto you know and it also gives us an opportunity to educate as many people as we can in the public about the dangers to our health to the purity of our food system to our seeds by joining in with all of these other seed companies and consumers and farmers and saying no to GMO so your customers actually want you to tell them that the seeds they get from you are guaranteed not to be transgenic the absolutely care and we do things like testing having guidelines about how far you have to be from other farms that are producing the type of seed to try as much as we can to offer a guarantee to our customers that they're going to get pure seed from us this is southern exposure seat exchange that's us so they expose your seat exchange their website southernxposure com there we have lots of information about the lawsuit about growing food and all the things that are going on to support that kind of activity in our region you know our growers we have protocols for not being contaminated and then in order to follow up on that we have to do testing to make sure we didn't get accidental contamination and we had a case it actually wasn't a crop that we were getting for ourselves but we were helping another seed company with one of our growers to grow something from them and they're a mile from anybody who's growing GM corn and they had one lot that tested positive for GMOs and this just makes you think oh my goodness we have to even take more precautions you know against this and if those neighbors cows had come in and eat in your crop you could you know get some kind of judgment in court and they would have to pay or repair their fences or do something but well you know another thing that's going on is not so much directly about this lawsuit but i also am on the board of the organic seed alliance and we that organization has been involved in the Willamette Valley in Oregon where most of the organic beat and charged seed is produced with fighting montano wanting to grow that crop their their GMO sugar beets when they know that that pollen truck travels 45 miles you know just these big clouds of pollen at the time and drop beats four very tiny but they're talking about GMOs sugar boosters cross with chard and this is like one of the only places that a large amount of Oregon a seat is produced in the in in the country and they've been growing this GMO stuff somewhere else before but they decided they need to grow it there and it's like a big fight people you know like in the counties or trying to knock them out they're taking people to court you know they have a lot of money and this is how they beat farmers down you know they take you to court about some any any nonsense and they just use up all your money until you just fall over and roll over well that was the concern I expressed the senator Cain it's like if we don't have some protection you're telling me well don't worry about whether it's labeled genetically modified or not you can label yours is organic or label it however you want and then you have a special label and if people are looking for it they can get that but my concern is how do I protect myself from a monsanto or someone that has a gene patents saying that my crop contains that they've got the money to run the DNA test I don't and they could easily just run their tests and know that the pollen is there uh-huh and i would get 11 hundred dollar per instance state fine every time I cleaned it wasn't and it got contaminated they want to instead of have having zero tolerance along with that have some percentage of GMO contamination that is acceptable like a bills man yeah a certain percentage of filthy can yes okay Oh GMO just buttons are filth compared yeah and if you have a small amount of contamination and you keep growing that seed you can inadvertently increase the amount of contamination I just really why the especially the Big Island they're really big organic growers there they've got a very nice environment and they're isolated I and they're trying so desperately to grow their own food because I eighty-five percent oh and it's very expensive yeah and but buying thousands of acres isolation and they want the climate I'm telling you the lamb Valley Hawaii the climate is great I mean you can grow seed here in Virginia but one reason we have some growers who are like in Oregon it's certain crops we can grow and we can get seed and if you're saving a little bit for yourself that's fine but for the same amount of effort they can get eight times as much seed with less problems you know with any you know funguses and stuff attacking it because that is everything by all the salad comes from yeah and this valley and so Monsanto wants to take over and have control of most of these prime seed growing regions and actually mostly they're not growing GMOs at this point because they own so many non-gmo varieties that of course people should pay attention to which varieties come from Monsanto so that they're not spending their hard-earned dollars supporting it because they bought lots of conventional seed companies is seen how do I well one can't run it is rated well one thing that you can do is a petco seeds has put up a list of varieties that are commonly available that Monsanto owns the oh and she has non-modified yeah and these are non their list is primarily not it you know not conventional seeds that Monsanto owns we you know we've thought of it we just haven't quite got the resources to get all of that and keep it up to date because people buy and sell companies hot but and the other thing is most of these older varieties that they can that they have actually have just regular PvP patents which will expire shortly and like one of the things we do with those conventional varieties is hold on to some seed and then when patent expires offer some organic seed of it how do the patents expire on GMO while they do some day 50 years what a difference because they're they're made for here's what their dreams and I mean higher ethical purposes they're not expiring because they change the traits slightly and reap get a new patent and so and they take the old one off the market five or six years before the patent expires too so that people who are inter transgenics cannot save back seed in any substantial quality quantity long enough to use the old trade not that we will want to ourselves but even someone who will want to would have trouble cuz these are fuel crops look at that thing the back of that the packet of those just for fun go into you know a regular farmer seed place and pick up a packet of this is by opening this packet you agree you know how you know when it's really modify my cuz there's a yes a you own that there's also you can also tell about seeds that are not GMO that they control their starting to put that on farmer quantities of the conventional seeds that they are selling as well because I think they have plans in the future well there you have it the reason why we need to really be watching transgenic material and stay tuned next week for more about this court case and this attempt of 83 plaintiffs to try to stop the ownership of plant genes well now in the 80s the late 80s or Virginia did the 1998 Virginia food at which campaign vehement Lee for thinking it was going to protect us from all of this right Monsanto came to us in the organic certification quoting Rachel Carson that we can make the plants have their own insecticide so you organic growers won't have to use them and we were like no and I mean they offered money they were going to like pay for the whole organic certification program and and and greatly support it as long as when we wrote the regulations that modified materials were no different than Gregor Mendel aha cross and peas and that plants that were developed to be resistant against diseases and insects were automatically organic because there was no applied herbicides pesticides fungicides and I think about a Trojan horse huh yeah it was well it alarmed a lot of us but we didn't really understand what was going on but it was it was their genuine belief and and I recently heard something on NPR where Rachel Carson retracted some of that stuff that she had said like I it seems like a really good idea that we breed plants that made their own pesticides and therefore we wouldn't have to apply them and certainly that's better than DDT but it's not it's no toward her at the end of her life she was like whoa wait a minute this is not going the right direction right now Korn is really high and corn is being groped all across the United States yep and in Jewish or animal feed and right by your fuel yeah and and those farmers are making money on that yeah and there is no way that you can get them to grow non-gmo corn they're gonna they're energetic but here that why some good news maybe is any number of people including right here in Virginia Chris Slade at virginia state is showing farmers who can take two acres intensively planted with food crops that are not commodity crops and get the same profit that they would growing 50 and sometimes a hundred eighties 58 yeah this is something that i know for a number of our growers our seed growers who were not organic or some of them were true you know actually went through this three years to be come organic and and they are still making a good amount of money from their two or three horsemen it's very different financial plan than the guy that's making money on the ethanol coordinate yeah they can just pay somebody one time to drill it or plant it in with the chemicals right in the ground and then come back and harvest it that the people that are really doing the seed saving and the organic growing they're investing all the time and the whole season there they're monitoring stuff and they're doing a lot of handwork they're composting and adding materials mm-hmm and I'm not and and that doesn't show up when you walk into Whole Foods and you see the the carrots grown in the desert and Israel and the carrots grown here in Virginia that the amount of effort that's different between the two doesn't show up but what happens is one one guy survives because he makes enough money the other guy fades away and that's what I'm worried about what you're saying with exactly modified as they create a financial system that whether we win fighting or not we all fade away because none of us survived long enough for our kids to keep doing savin see the whole point of making a new food system is to get farmers who are farming for other reasons and get consumers who know that food is not cheap that they're going to have to if we want to have a sustainable system we're going to have to choose to spend our money on okay the real cost of food and consider that good I mean we spent a lot of money on food and restaurants if we get real food and you know and cook that food if we in our restaurants look to have fresh local produce as a value that we appreciate in the meals that we get that's how we can have it I mean I go you know I I've spent time in Europe food is not cheap in Europe it just isn't and that's why having organic food is not such a deal there because food period is not cheap because it's important to grow food locally to have a system where you can feed yourself we didn't happen we didn't happen to live through the Second World War where there was no food that was brought in you didn't know how to grow it yeah you were out in the case without a metal this is sort of the kingpin for their financial success and their ability to dominate yeah is to be able to own this and apply these triple damages to anyone who possesses it that they didn't get a license and that and they don't have they mostly don't know they're even if they said this in court they don't sue that many people but they take so many people they threatened to sue them and settle out of court that that person is going to stop talking about it you know 10 times the number of people that they take to court they do that and so they just quiet them down so you don't hear a word about what they said they promised they'd we're now going to talk to anybody about this so what I want to try to do is get the same thing for pricing go absolutely so I said this for humans now we need to say it for our food yes and we right now unfortunately the companies that have these patents on our food have had you know over 20 years to make billions of dollars that they can throw at anything we do to try to change the situation and the only way it's going to be is going to be something like in the civil rights movement where you have millions of people standing up and you know speaking their voices speaking with their money because these companies have more money than any small group of us ever hope to have so how do we get the general public when we still experience this in the markets and in the fresh farm markets general public comes they still are looking for the cheapest price what's your price on tomatoes what's your price on sweet corn they might ask you where you organic or do you use GMOs that they might ask it cursory but they are really looking at the price and if the guy down here has got five years for a dollar in mine three years for a dollar even if his it Roundup Ready they're going to go for that well denim item I gotta get grown they they're not I cook it give it to him with some butter he'll pay me two walks for it uh-huh and so and we'll see this at the harvest vessel it'll all be prepared food nobody will take home fresh food yeah and most of our markets now eighty percent of the vendors are cooking things and selling somebody something for five to ten dollars but they don't want to give me and Oliver are handful of coppers and I hey get home cook this else oh yeah that's funny question is a deal you know what has any time well what our lives are so pressure they have to work with schools I mean what we do at a southern exposure is we spend a lot of our resources on education we work with school groups who were with for age groups we work with food pantries and all of these kinds of places that you know are giving people the idea that you can make a difference in your life in the life of your family by taking the time lame you know the gift that you can give them is fresh home good high quality food that seems to me to be the real key if even if you pull the kingpin out of Monsanto by they they don't have this right to sue they don't have this ability to to own a patent and profit by it we still have a general public that doesn't know how to feed themselves and doesn't know how they can balance their time budget and cook food right raw food and still is you know we've got that ball Martin mentality absolutely our prices buy a cheaper live better about the Chinese yeah and you know I we need to educate and we also need to do research about how things you know work if somebody like myself you know I deal with being overweight there are many studies about overweight women if you're eating well in other ways you don't end up with high blood pressure or diabetes or things which other people and my family died from that I don't have you know i mean and i may never you know stay then you know but so we start going here it is medicine it absolutely is and and there are their programs now where they give double benefits for food stamps if you spend it at a farmers market and the ones that are robust have shown you know decreases in diabetes and high blood pressure particular which are quite expensive to the state for four people of ten percent or more in like two years so there's really a public benefit to instead of subsidizing the corporations that are suing the farmers trying to grow things to subsidize those farmers to keep growing things that might be a little more difficult and less profitable to grow and better help you and what Don what you're saying is this is a multi generational thing yeah it's not just that we might get sick from that particular feed we get when we might pass this on to multiple generation where we become intolerant and and our health breaks down sort of like in a global a global residual I'm not change in the gene pool that will affect all humans that's right for generations to come yeah okay I'm up against yeah and you know we can make a difference right now as I tell every time I give a talk I say if you want to have good food vote with your dollars by good food cook good food teach your children to love good food from time to time like we do some work with mothers newsmagazine one of the things they do is they'll take some variety that we are some other heirloom company offers and do you know analysis it like the Floriani flip corn that has more protein you know available they're just eating the same thing that you would otherwise and you know some of the tomatoes they can't produce as many tomatoes per plant that you have more nutrients and each one is we got to eat closer to the farm yeah because people don't even like to buy them when they're perfect at you know in a market they think well I'm gonna bring him home and had it returned at last yeah well last two weeks yeah it's like it's fresh lettuce it'll last ten minutes if you leave it in your 90-degree car yeah you know if you don't eat it before you leave it in the car you've lost it yeah but that's what people want it to be like a TV dinner they can pull it out six months later and push up I honest yeah I tell them if they wanted to keep get some roots well now we're worried about the potatoes because they you know maybe those skins are set by an herbicide kill yeah well that's why you ought to get a winter CSA going in your local area yeah our children are going to have trouble we don't even recognize because we've contaminated the food supply with these transgenic materials they're going to cross whether you get sued or not for it pretty soon you're not going to have any heirloom varieties that are uncontaminated it's definitely one of the things with you know joining these various lawsuits week they say we we feel like you need to go after it three ways so um whenever you can why not maybe we'll win one especially and then the other is is lobby as much as you can because as I say you might not think it makes that much difference but I can remember being a towel and being drugged by my grandmother down the streets to some March you know and she said nothing may happen in your lifetime but you are not going to have a better future if something doesn't so I'm going to take you here you're going to walk with me and then when enough people were you know made aware of the bad things are happening and for us it's important to let them know about these risks to their health to their children's health to the health of our animals so that people will join in our fight and we have nothing to lose except the life that we want for ourselves so we better fight for it and then we're spending money spend your money in the right way yeah all of these things together might prevail somehow we've got to make it so that the the farmers doing the right thing make enough money that they become financially competitive with the corporations that are well this is you know what started out when people started with csas it was one way of saying I care enough about this food that I'm going to pay my farmer a reasonable amount for that food and the more the more that you tell people that being a good person that is trying to build this life means allocating more of your resources to food is important and I feel like sometimes that we under emphasize that well you know there are there are young people out there doing incredible things I love you guys know about farm hack I love it when people who have technical backgrounds say I want to farm and I want to do it a little bit easier on my back and so they're reinventing how you can farm on a few acres and and making it more like we can have more farmers into the future all we need to do is support them so that they don't go broke it's very challenging so what we can do as individuals is join us esa know our farmer by local and and and start spending our money in that way absolutely i mean it is you know the the thing that they've said all along act locally first you have the most control there and of course continue to take these larger actions but the thing that you can do and nobody else can stop you from doing is where you buy your food how you prepare your food what you teach your children we need the public to be aware get rid of the apathy start voting with your dollars and recognize that you're poisoning yourself if you don't spend more and get the true cost of good food i wanted to mention another to other websites that have addressed these issues quite often one is escada the organic seed birds and trade association which are lead plaintiffs in our lawsuit and they you just can keep up to date with what's going on and then pub hat but it's more of a total legal thing there but they do tell you about the literal things on the lawsuit and then the organic seed alliance it just gives you more about all of these issues around seeds and how to try to maintain a peer seed source and where to go and find the position of the week because you might as well it doesn't take very much time to add that to your list of what you should do well there you have it the real reason why you need to buy from your local farmer at the farmers market not finding the

new hemp was already old in the service of mankind for thousands of years even then this plant had been grown for cordage and coarse cloth in China and elsewhere in the East for centuries prior to about 1850 all the ships that sail the Western seas were rigged with hempen rope and sales for the Sailor no less than the hangman hemp was indispensable the Conestoga wagons and Ferris schooners of pioneer days were covered with help and canvas indeed the very word canvas comes from the Arabic word for him in 1813 the Americans took a trip across the lake ontario to steal a lot of help first they captured all four york the royal ship burned down then they went to harbor front to see what could be fouled they fill 14 ships with amp sales and hemp rope burning all the rest before they torched the town down the Brits got so mad sea and Parliament a burnin river they cried and burn the White House down and the old day is breaking was done by hand one of the hardest jobs known to man now the power breaker makes quick work of it the hemp industry can now recover 95% to the fibers rather than the twenty-five to fifty percent as before in 1935 Henry Ford's desired to unite industry and agriculture would lead to the formation of the farm commercial council the commercial model would use the country's farmers to supply the industrial needs of the 20th century the expanded markets would bolster the dismal state of affairs and American farms and he's the emerging problems of Petro chemical pollution Ford and the council would find support in the like-minded genius of Thomas Edison and plant geneticists George Washington Carver and Luther Burbank in 1938 advances in hemp decortication equipment prompted Popular Mechanics magazine to call him the billion-dollar crop with 25,000 uses the development sprouted a new kind of hemp industry in Minnesota one poised to exploit the cellulose rich herds for use in the plastics industry in 1916 the Department of Agriculture published bulletin 404 written by leister Dewey and plant and paper chemist Jason Merrill printed on hemp paper the bulletin warned that forests cannot withstand the demands and praised the paper potential of him Henry Ford had a vision of growing automobiles from the soil at the company's river rouge plant researchers used annual crops to develop biodegradable car parts at in 1941 unveiled a car whose plastic body was made entirely from hemp wheat straw incisal the wild plastic withstood blows 10 times as great as steel without denting and its reduced weight promised better fuel efficiency 1937 was my first summer to spend with my grandfather and at that time they grew hemp to make rope and him in the next farmer had a machine and you made your threads okay after you had it on the spools then you would go and make rope but then in in in the latter years of the depression they banned it it was banned by the governments of North America it came at just when the Depression was right at its worst about 19 in this area about 1937 the law was passed that it was illegal to have emceed was illegal to have it and it was illegal to grow it it was actually illegal to have em seed in your possession it will stop being used by mackenzie king and you would I would listen to the old-timers my Uncle Bill and my grandpa and Fred Wagner and those people talking like they really felt that they had been hardly the hard done by in 1942 in a full reversal the US Department of Agriculture presented the movie hemp for victory encouraging farmers to grow him the hemp industry was in decline when the United States entered World War two with a nation supply of Manila ham and Jude curtailed by the Japanese invasion of the Philippines the government turned to the farmers for help the war hemp industries built 42 mills throughout the Midwest hemp production rose dramatically as the nation's farmers produced 60 million pounds of fiber for the country supply of cordage but then they banned it it was banned by the government of North America in the waning years of the 20th century the earth's most useful crop we emerged on farms the world over for more than half a century hemp was a crop and exiled to bring into the world 200 million new people to a year that equal to the panera equal to the population united state and to not want to bring in a source of shelter and

dog 4 and I grabbed this from Green Farms in Mesa and this is about high-grade extracts wonderful stuff man check it out not run thank you guys the high grade for putting out on your label so we don't need to ask and this is a wonderful strain man it's very clean very tasty and I love the taste is very pungent got this gassy kind of a citrus cleaner type of taste to it wonderful I love that kind of stuff and this is what we got loaded up first today it's beautiful stuff man very amber in color and a wonderful strain but yeah I heard it's a phenotype of chem bug for a more indica 5 version out of all the the FIH knows I heard that this is the more stony at a more potent stronger phenotype so I was excited to try it out man and this is wonderful it's a good day time in the car wonderful for stuff like stress depression the pain relief was good if you suffer from anxiety panic attack so just like any kind of social disorders and anxieties and stuff like that you might want to medicate with this strain they just give it a shot because it's very chill it's very mellow very relaxing but the same time it's also uplifting and happy and euphoric so yeah it's just like a more relaxed version of chem dog and I felt like this would be good for something like a TD ADHD because it was kind of mellow and relaxed and at the same time it was attentive kind of focused you weren't zeroed in but if you're sitting down watching a movie you'll be into it man you know you'll be you'll be like you'll be in you'll be in tune with whatever it is that that interests you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and now Ken bug for is a wonderful strain that could be medicated with any time of the day you just might want to be well-rested though but still a very chill strain is good for just about anything watching movies is great I did have to do like water 20 rounds or shopping and everything was wonderful with this training it was functional I think because it is kind of attentive and focused driving around with no problem having patience was up was a big thing I was shopping with my wife there man my wife some can shop and if you don't have patience you're not gonna last you go shop you're not shopping like 1 2 hours so I'm like 5 hours and at the mall so like this kind of like it mostly was very mellow if you have like pepper issues and issues me snap a lot especially if you're dealing with like chronic pain and you car you always dealing with pain and just where it's on you you know after why you can irritate it you're hesitating you get frustrated this is a good train to kind of chill you out so you can keep your emotions in check because you might be what your family snapping at them because you're irritated you're annoyed by out of paying you're dealing with and all the other issues that you got there's a whole kind of chilled out so you can be cool man cuz you need to be cool anyways have a good on bus a cool summer time is hot", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "ekTX1gpAQq4":

ANOTHER ASPECT TO THE BILL THE GOVERNOR PASSED THIS WEEK IS A CLEARER DEFINITION OF BUYING AND SELLING PRODUCTS WITH C-B-D. OUR EMILY HARRISON JOINS US LIVE WITH MORE... EMILY THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SELL THESE PRODUCTS FOR AWHILE NOW... EMILY THEY COULD SELL IT AS LONG AS IT DIDNT HAVE ANY THC... BUT WHEN IT CAME TO GROWING IT THAT WAS A BIG NO...UNTIL NOW. LOCAL FARMERS ARE MAKING PLANS TO PRODUCE HEMP... ALLOWING THEM TO DIVERSIFY THEIR CROPS AND OUR ECONOMY. Jennifer Jeppson - Co-owner Hemp Maiden \"there are several farmers who already have land set aside. they're already ready.\" COTTON'S KING...BUT WITH THE LEGALIZATION OF HEMP FARMERS ARE GETTING READY TO CASH IN ON THIS CROP TOO. Jennifer Jeppson - Co-owner Hemp Maiden the second their lawyers tell them go ahead get started, here's the paperwork, they're going to be filling it out. THE HEMP BILL WILL ALLOW HEMP TO BE COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED IN ANY FORM. INCLUDING OILS AS LONG AS THERE'S LESS THAN POINT-3 PERCENT OF THC IN IT.. DISTRIBUTORS SAY THE NEW BILL WILL HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. Jennifer Jeppson - Co-owner Hemp Maiden We've got farmers who are going to be putting fields to use that they weren't using previously, which means they're going to need more field hands, they're going to need more equipment. So that's directly affecting love access and personnel right there being able to buy more from businesses being able to hire more people. THE SET UP FOR HOW FARMERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL WORK TOGETHER STILL NEEDS TO BE FIGURED OUT.. BUT IT'S NOT STOPPING SOME C- B-D STORES FROM GETTING READY TO SET UP SHOP. Shane McFarlin - New CBD Owner with all the recent launch changes that have been happening, we decided this as an industry we want to get into. That being said, it has taken some turns, it's taken some twists that we weren't expecting. But it's good. It's all good. FARMERS SAY HEMP IS EXTREMELY ADAPTABLE.. AND WHILE IT WON'T BE PRODUCED LARGE-SCALE. IT WILL DEFINETLY HAVE A PRESENCE IN LUBBOCK... Jennifer Jeppson - Co-owner Hemp Maiden we currently don't carry any products that are currently that are manufactured in Texas because up to this point that they haven't been available, In the future for manufacuturing to happen in Lubbock - that will be a huge revenue maker EMILY A REMINDER THAT RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS STILL ILLEGAL.

woke up anyways today we got a new vendor for the channel they kind of well know I've been wanting to try their stuff for a long time we got Industrial have fun now I got three of their strengths I got lifter forbidden fruit and GDP aka granddaddy Perth which is one of my favorite strains of all time before I begin my review I want to give a little shout out to daily high club I'm gonna be using this bubbler I got from their January subscription box I love it it's awesome can't wait to try it out you're gonna see me use it first right here I'm not sponsor I'm not paid nothing by Danny high club just one of the shout that melon since I've tried lifter a million times you are ill then on the channel I tried lifter almost every week I must save that for last I usually say best for last I must say the leaf relax I'm gonna go straight for that granddaddy / I want to see what the effects are since its granddaddy purp is a traditional cannabis string and they bred a hemp strain like that I want to see what the effects are like it was anything like the handi indica that the actual brand any purpose light 0.6 percent THC 16.9% CBD so real high CP alright you know the packaging and everything this is one gram seal seal off I need to let this narrow you got a little delay to pack inside thematic that's cool keeping it nicely nice and waste either that is incredibly fluffy or that's more than one gram that looks about two almost three grams it could just be very fluffy I'm not kind of uneven at my scale out the actual flower looks good the trim job is not nice I don't know if you could see that you see all the sugary kind of sticks out why don't we just for the sake of smoke hand I need to take off some little leaf and while I do that I'm gonna give them my inspection look for any seeds mold etc all right we're looking a lot better now I got all those crazy sugar leads all the smells starting to come out so I don't know if it necessarily smells like GDP it does smell good it smells like it could it's very sticky just from pulling out those sugar leaves the stickiness is it's on my fingers own it smelled like it could here a few days more but it's good it has a sweet berry ish kind of dinky gasps II smell as a little bit of that cush spice to it with there's a slightest slightest hint of grassy a smell but I know that'll go away but it's very frosty everything everything was good I'm gonna go ahead and put a high-resolution image of the GEP here upon breaking it down they got very cushy so my first impression so far like it's very sticky I didn't find any seeds or anything the Cure is great and head up await attack inside so the moistures perfect he goes the GDP from industrial that far [Music] [Music] not a bad taste it actually tastes kind of cushy it has that cush spice on the back of the throat it's relatively smooth so far I don't really have any complaints let me come back two or five minutes on this you know how I feel all right come back the first thing I have to say about that JEP I love it now it's not as heavy sedated feeling as you get from traditional GDP but it is definitely more sedate it's definitely on the indica scale as far as hemp goes this is a great great early morning or nighttime strain and I say early morning because if you're not doing anything you wake up in the morning sometimes you're sleepy the groggy feel like crap you want to you know chill a little bit and definitely a good evening nighttime straining it's sticky it smells good it looks really nice it tastes not too bad and it has really good effects so definite Shabbat seal of approval gas passer biomass that's definite gas right there I love that GDP from industrial hemp farms that's definitely a new favor strain for me all right let's move on to the forbidden fruit now test results say 0.53 percent THC 11.3% CBD so the CBD isn't as high as the GDP still is good enough all right sealed once again I hate when I rip the seals off unevenly that grinds my gears Oh Lord you see and now it's like halfway done I'm on a stand line my butchered unsealing leader it's a hot act list anything the forbidden fruit does not smell very good another bo Veda pack and that one I appreciate that [Applause] okay I'm gonna be honest you guys they're forbidden fruit with a trim job this is almost non-existent and I can't even help this so when I put a high resolution picture you're gonna see exactly how I pulled it out of the pack the trim job is almost non-existent this is almost like they just took a butt off the planet dried it halfway and cured it and stuck it in here the smell strong chlorophyll smell like I get a very slight like Barry citrus scent but also 50% of the smell there's an uncured kind of grassy hey smell so this is definitely not done man cure I can tell when it's when it's done being cured it's gonna have a sweet citrus smell and you know it might not even be the cure it might just be because there's all this dried sugar leaf that has like not even sugar leaf this is just there's hardly any sugar I can see when I get down into the but it's very resinous and stinky take a look at you check out you know the true job is just atrocious that's not cool I have a feeling that because of all that leaf matter that's on there it's gonna make it really harsh all right so when I broke it down it is incredibly sticky so that's a good thing all right you goes the forbidden fruit [Music] yeah you know it's not super harsh but that the trim job definitely comes through in the smoke like you can taste the leaf enos of it anytime you can taste leaf enos you kind of say smoke and that takes away from any type of good flavor that the bud itself would have let me finish this bowl I'll come back to you in a few minutes to let you know how I feel all right I'm back I definitely feel the effects I want to say this is more of like a hybrid kind of all date strain afternoon maybe evening strain not too like super energetic not to oblivion I do feel a bit of couch lock though from that but it's not sedated once again I appreciate the vihuela pack inside it kept the moisture hood it was very sticky and I feel like the bud itself has a lot of potential but just it has a non-existent trim job it's like just covered in leaf they didn't trim it or they sloppily threw it through a machine trimmer I don't know industrial hemp farms if you're watching that I don't know I got an unlucky trimmed about it but if that's what all your forbidden fruit looks like and should have trimmed that down a little the trim job and all the meat really really takes away from the flower itself alright last but hopefully not least we have the lifter like I always say I've tried lifter million times lifter is probably the single number one most popular strain across the board I ain't lost every single vendor has lifted somewhere better than others I has us 0.61% THC 15.9% seed so it has a good amount of CBD alright we're sealed up let's hope this time I got it in first try another poll beta pack that's nice adjust my posture for this day well that's supposed to like fall oh it has a very sweet pungent sweet smell kind of like a mixed berry yogurt which I've said before about another strain a very pungent sweet berry smoothies scent the liberal Vater pack inside oh no oh no that's a shame unfortunately during that the packaging or the shipping or something internal the bud got compressed and that sucks because this is an absolutely beautiful bud it is beautiful all of the calyxes are dark purple but like a uniform purple all over a little bit of the green from the leaf showing through it like the light orange kind of peaches color pistols oh man I'm so mad that this got compressed in its look it's like kind of flat like I feel like it got squished during shipping oh that's a shame I'm telling you this this but had to have been absolutely beautiful like one of the prettiest that you've probably seen man that sucks well put a high-resolution image here check it out you can kind of tell just imagine if it wasn't social wish just like in the color look that dark purple of everything is beautiful and is that a pretty Bowl oh my god breaking this flower down it is fuchsia on the inside and purple it is absolutely beautiful I'm actually gonna have to contact industrial head form to see if I can maybe get some more that's lifter that isn't compressed just for a picture of it at least it's beautiful which smells good the cure is perfect its moist that's tryna it's priestly a little bit of throat burn nothing too crazy [Music] it tastes Pelton the second kid was a lot smoothie it has more of a regular hemp taste nothing too crazy over the harshness smooth not too harsh not as smooth as the GDP but it's decent nothing negative to say again let me finish this bowl and I'll let you know how I feel [Music] alright I'm back this lifter has a very clear-headed but potent effect kind of reminds me of a CVG almost it's very clear headed but I can feel it very strong I don't know how to describe that it's definitely the harshest of the three as far as the smoke goes Wow is that a beautiful flower absolutely gorgeous flower I'm just it's a shame that it looks the way that it does which is only from like the packaging or shipping overall I'm have to give that the ship a seal of approval it was a nice lifter it smells delicious it smells amazing actually no complaints about the smell the trim is fine the cure is good the flower is beautiful dark purple on the outside of bright fuchsia on the inside and it definitely has some very noticeable effects so we got two out of three that were really good the forbidden fruit like I said the trim job just kind of ruins that one a little bit but hey I do on this review I'll never say I like something when I don't I'm not paid I'm not sponsored everything is 100% honest anyways that's

can heal the earth and heal each other and help each other and I think that regenerative cannabis has a lot of potential to do that and we really feel like that that's one of our main goals of why we do what we do we want to eat clean food smoke clean weed and the diverse and sort of small farmer farming practices that are happening to is sort of what we need to see throughout agriculture as well these small family farms and people being able to sustain themselves on the land is really important the land wants us to interact with it and to listen to it and imitate what it's doing but then bring it beyond in our ability to try to create a system that's self-sustaining I can't really see not having animals be a part of the farm with merino sheep for wool and meat we have meat birds that go to farmers market we know that every time we have to take some fertility from off farm that there's a missing link in what we're doing that we can improve on that we making bone broth after we're done with the bones now we're crushing the bones and now we have bone meal so we just constantly trying to figure out how to close the loop the animals I think are sort of how we're able to make everything possible the way we want to because they're able to turn this stuff into gold and I just love watching them eat the hay and I just always in such awe that they're able to transform that material into something that nurtures the land so much they're just made to be with each other the plant and animal components we're making kimchi we're getting cabbage from a local farm and then we got a bunch of carrots from our farm peppers from our farm as well and just mixing them all together with some salt and a little water and let the magic happen and hopefully those will be sold at farmer's market and our local co-op I feel like I wish we live in a society we didn't have to make money to survive but that is where we live and so anytime I get a chance to do things without having to make money is what really feeds our soul and I think what really feels good I would give away all the food that we grow but I just can't do that and so when there's opportunities and things to help out the community to help with the library or help cook food for a fundraiser that's what feels so good yeah we want to live in community so we find ways to make community happen", "4VU9e8ggc3o": "[Music] the Oregon Liquor Control Commission has created the go legal public awareness campaign to help Oregonians better understand our state's legal marijuana market the go legal campaign underscores the importance of marijuana consumers and the industry choosing to participate in the regulated market while working together to eliminate the illegal market and its criminal activity producers plant cultivate grow harvest and dry marihuana here we introduce some of our licensees and learn how being a part of Oh LC C's regulated market has impacted their business focus a lot of our energy on on trying to make sure that our plants are growing as naturally as I can being a part of the newest and best and brightest making sure that our growers have the right information to be successful making sure that every time our plants go to market they've been treated with the with the the best love and kindness that we can give them what cannabis has done for the state of Oregon in terms of bringing job opportunities has been tremendous we've hired a couple of people in the last year and we're looking at hiring probably another tendance 214 people in the next year giving people opportunities that never existed before without this industry you know there's ten or twelve thousand people that wouldn't be employed in the state of Oregon right now we are committed to paying a living wage here and health benefits and I think that people are really starting to see this industry this regulated industry as a boon for education and knowledge and breaking that stigma that has been long pervasive in this industry folks that have been working for decades in the cannabis industry now have a level of protection that they didn't before Oregon has a long history of supporting small companies and helping them retain their flavor if you will their identity and I feel this has been reflected in the OLC C's approach to regulation of upstart cannabis companies Oregonians are revolutionary it's one of the reasons we moved here 25 years ago we like the fact that cottage industries were respected people could do things from their own property and make things or grow something and have it be accepted Oregon is doing a great job of rolling out the industry one of the aspects that I appreciate is the rigorous pesticide testing I think that that's going to set Oregon apart as the cannabis industry develops nationwide Oregon is going to develop a reputation for purity and integrity because of our rigorous pesticide testing exactly like why we want to eat organic and grow organic and have an organic orchard here and grow our own foods and work with locals here the same reason we want people to be doing it with cannabis and I think it's it's it's a it's something that people can understand see to sale is one of the best things that happen to the cannabis industry because it allows you to track where your plants came from these great little blue plant tags right here that tracks the plant all the way from when it was a seed that was propagated and that goes all the way through to the bottom the shelf or the oil that was produced by it or the edible that was produced by it that increases the level of transparency and accountability of growers to know that it all comes back to the soil - to where the plant came from and to grew it with what practices in ten years I see the Oregon cannabis industry being a nationwide leader cannabis may be Oregon's number one cash crop and I certainly believe that it's going to be one of the largest economic sectors in Oregon in ten years [Music]", "kxN6h2eEA3o": "so where are we going again Christina she's doing those I'm just along for the ride lots of farms in Springfield Colorado people are flying in from all over the country for this event you excited will be my first time actually in a hempfield so this is the first hempfield that's been harvested in the US since the 50s that's me 33 countries around the world or profiting and enjoying the positive benefits of growing this amazing plant but we're not in the US we know that our customers want him because they buy it in ever increasing quantities really excited about the potential to partner with American farmers who want to grow it as we really see this as the next step in American agriculture this is a kind of historic moment we're going to come out and see this this hempfield and this will be the first of hopefully thousands of hemp fields across America in the coming decades the DEA published in the Federal Register in September 2001 that hemp foods was in the same category as heroin class one scheduled drug which is ridiculous you know you know hemp seeds hemp oil this is not a drug crop this is most nutritious seed in the world right man welcome regulation be right here we go here we go so what's your plan so you're gonna harvest them and then stick them into bins and let them dry along with dr. bronner's and nature's path and the tivo the hempen is association we sued the federal government and it took us two and a half years until two thousand four to win a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal and now him foods are legal and if you can eat him you can wear him these jeans are from him that shirt i'm wearing is made from him why can't we grow it a number of states have passed laws that allow for hemp farming under state law and the only impediment so far that's helped farmers back has been the federal law it's not a drug industrial hemp spin clumped together with marijuana and we've been trying to separate it you know it's the most ridiculous part of the drug war that a non-drug agricultural crop is treated as a schedule 1 substance the fact is you can't get high from industrial hemp there's so little of the psychoactive component in hanford less than three-tenths of 1% by law we're really happy with the hemp we get from Canada and that's growing all the time but I think because it's illegal to grow in the United States the prices are artificially high it's the perfect food in terms of having all the amino acids you need it's a complete protein it's got a great spectrum of fatty acids high in fiber tastes great we're talking about a billion dollar opportunity for American farmers with all the different uses for him not only for food but for textiles and construction in the UK we've got them they're building these incredibly energy-efficient homes using have heard this the woody part of the stock here blending it with lime it has excellent insulation energy-saving qualities they don't have any insect problems and it's also fire resistant industrial hemp is just poised for a comeback and is coming back because it is a sustainable alternative renewable resource where there's biocomposites or textiles it grows like a weed you don't need herbicides pesticides a whole lot of fertilizer the inputs are pretty minimal lends itself well to organic farming systems and you compare that to say that cotton where you know massive amounts of water huge amounts are beside construction materials textiles body care clothing food the whole thing is is all being in imported from Canada Europe China and overseas so the farmers in those countries are allowed to take advantage of hemp but American farmers are being denied this opportunity America was founded on him in 1700s the most important agriculture crop in the whole world was industrial hemp George Washington grew hemp on his plantation in Mount Vernon Thomas Jefferson grew hemp New Hampshire is actually named after hemp amp is the Northern European name for him one of the nice things over the last 13 years as we've been working on this is that in every state where we've worked on legislation it's always been on a bipartisan basis farmers wouldn't grow it if they weren't able to make money and that's what's really important is we want to you know get farmers in the United States growing this crop we have Ryan Laughlin super brave super courageous ready to do it he's like okay I'm just ready to do this to grow industrial hemp in this cultural moment I think it is brilliant it's a half a circle right what we got here so it's 60 acres you got to start somewhere so this is you know the first little steps of creating those you know getting this industry back into powerful producing initially in America you know which it will be guarantee it it's great for you know literally the whole planet man I've been waiting for 20 some years for this you know I've helped harvest in Canada but in America this is a whole different ball game this is a whole other species of animal coming across there you know new generations coming forward like Ryan's daughter out in the hempfield this isn't something to her that elicits this is a crop they grow on their farm and I think that that's what's really touching lots of the times when I go to family farms and it's a family farm and though their kids are out there working the fields or combine all around to go before we started vote hemp in two thousand thinking oh yeah three to five years we'd be able together again here we are thirteen years later and we finally putting our first drop this is so I momentous and historian we're not quite done yet though you know we still need to get Congress to pass several bills that we have and we've got a bill in the house that has 47 bipartisan co-sponsors if you go to vote hemp com put in your zip code find out who represents you in Congress if you don't already now they'll give

of HempFarmingAcademy.com and in this video I am going to\nshow you how to farm industrial hemp using the farming methods that we used\nthis year so stick with me. First of all I just want to mention that we've had a\nton of fun this year farming him it's a beautiful plant and it's almost\ninstantly gratifying to watch these things grow we planted them early May\nand they're about 5 or 6 inches tall just these little things you didn't even\nknow if they're gonna survive and before you know it they are growing and every\nweek there's progress until they get to the size where they're almost as tall as\nme there's tall as me in some areas and then they're just producing beautiful\nflowers and have a really nice smell so even though the plants mature over the\ncourse of four months here in Central Oregon we have been planning this\nprocess over the course of more like nine months since the beginning of the\nyear taking samples of our soil and getting those tested understand the pH\nlevels and also understand the nutrients within the soil and then it took some\ntime to till the soil and get it right so that we could lay our plastic in our\ntrip line and eventually plant in early June. One of the things that you're going to\nwant to consider when you decide that you're gonna farm him is what genetics\nare you going to use not all seeds are created equal for us it was really\nimportant that the seed company had a good track record of producing really\nlarge high CBD percentage plants and also they a high percentage feminization\nrate out of the 12,000 plants that we have here in this field we've only found\nfive male plants that we had to remove which makes farming a little bit easier\nand we know that we're gonna be able to keep most of our crop once we decided on\nthe genetics that we were going to use for this field in propagating the seeds\nin a greenhouse in early May and during that time that gave us the ability to be\nable to lay our rows and lay our plastic mulch and our drip tape and establish a\nnice healthy moist soil to be able to plant our seedlings in in early June when it comes time to plant your\nseedlings into the ground you want to get as much help as possible we got\nabout seven or eight people on planting days to be able to help us and we\nutilized a waterwheel transplant er which is an implement that goes on the\nback of a tractor and has two seeds where two people can sit and they will\ndrop their seedlings into holes that are created by the transplant er about four\nacres into the ground each day once the seedlings are in the ground the next\ncouple months really is all about just making sure the plant is getting all of\nthe proper water and nutrients that it needs to be able to fulfill its genetic\npotential those farming duties would include just checking and removing weeds\nin your rows you can notice in our field we're pretty much weed free we have a\nreally clean field and this has really helped us allow all of the nutrients and\nwater to go straight to the plant instead of it being robbed by weeds and\nother types of things the other thing with weeds is you really don't want that\nin your biomass at the end of the season so it's really important to be able to\nkeep it clean field the other thing you want to stay on top of is watering and\ngiving the plants the fertilizer and the nutrients that they need throughout the\nseason obviously this is gonna be a little bit different in the beginning of\nthe season from the middle and towards the end of the season so in the\nbeginning the plants are small they're really not drinking a lot of water and\nthey don't need a lot of water but when it gets really hot in the middle of the\nsummer mid-july plants are large and they are drinking a lot of water seen to\nmake sure they're getting enough water at that point that they're getting the\nnutrients that they need sometime mid to late July the plan is going to transfer\nfrom the vegetative stage to the flowering stage and it's going to really\nstart focusing on producing flowers for the rest of the season and so you're\ngonna want to switch up your fertilizer to be able to help that out because the\nSun and the light schedule is telling the plant hey it's time to be able to\nbud and see you want your fertilizer and your nutrients to be able to follow that\nschedule that they are naturally getting from the sunlight when it comes to\nfertilization we fertilized straight through the drip tape right to the roots\nas well as a full-year feeding so at the beginning of the season when\nwe were full your feeling we just used a backpack sprayer and it was relatively\neasy to be able to walk the rose and spray the plants but as the plants got\nbigger you can imagine spraying a large plant like this is gonna take a lot of\ntime and to be able to do that it looks over 10 acres 12,000 plants it's gonna\ntake we figured it would probably take about 50 man-hours. So my partner\ndeveloped a new little mechanism and he was able to put sprayer on the back of a\nthree wheeler and be able to go up and down the rows and spray that way so that\nbrings up another point because we spaced our rows eight feet wide so that\nwe could drive a three or four wheeler down without any problems some people\ndon't like to do that they like to you know maximize their land we have a lot\nof land here and so we figured why not space the rows out really large so we\ncan drive an ATV up and down the rows so in a week or two we will be cutting and\ndrying the plants and we'll take a combine to be able to keep the really\nlight stuff and get rid of the stalks and stems so that we can have a real\nnice homogeneous biomass that we can send to the extraction facility to have\nthe oil extracted from these plants something that you'll definitely want to\nconsider before you decide to start farming hemp is the risk that's involved\nanytime you get into farming there's certain things that are out of your\ncontrol for instance this lasted about a month\nago we had a major major hail storm that swept through the region hail the size\nof gumballs and absolutely ravaged this field in many other fields around us you\ncan actually see some of the damage still on these leaves broke the stems\nbroke leaves and luckily it was about a month ago so the plant had just started\nflowering and after the hailstorm I think the plant gave all of its energy\nto producing the flowers we were fortunate because we still have\nsomething to show for it and it looks like this crop has not only survived but\nit's thrived but there are other farms in the region that lost everything they\nhad nothing but sticks and stems left in their fields so you definitely want to\nconsider the risk that's involved because there is a lot of risk in\nfarming and that's why I've created a couple resources for you the first one\nis a free pdf that is a hemp farming timeline and budget planner so on this\nPDF it'll go January through December and I'll tell you the things that you\nneed to be doing each month during that month and it'll also show you a per acre\nbudget so that you can plan your financing for your hemp farming all you\nhave to do to download that PDF for free is just click the link in the\ndescription and that will take you to a page where you can download the hemp\nfarming timeline and budget planner the other resource I want to offer you is\ncalled hen farming Academy hemp farming Academy is an online video course that\ntakes you step-by-step from field preparation all the way through harvest\nwhen it comes to a farming hemp I've partnered with farmer Tom Lauer Minh on\nthis project and farmer Tom's been growing cannabis and hemp for most of\nhis life and he brings a wealth of knowledge to this course so if you are\nplanning on farming hemp and you want some instructions and some help along\nthe way Hemp Farming Academy would be a great\nresource for you you can find it at HempFarmingAcademy.com or you can also\nclick the link that is in the description for that well thanks for\nwatching this video hopefully it's been helpful for you if you have any\nquestions or comments go ahead put those in the comments section below\nand I wish you a successful hen farming season.", "RWSoArgZHbw": "hey what up cut ups welcome to

ONE CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP DREAMS FOR A DIFFERENT PART OF DOWNTOWN SIOUX FALLS IN THE NIGHTS YOUR MONEY MATTERS. GOOD EVENING. LAWMAKERS SAY THIS COULD BE THE YEAR THAT INDUSTRIAL HEMP BECOMES LEGAL IN THE STATE. LAWMAKERS GATHER IN PIERRE TO BEGIN THE 2020 SESSION. THIS IS AS THE GOVERNOR SAYS THERE IS A POSSIBLE PATH TOWARDS THE GHETTOIZATION. LAST YEAR, THEY VETOED A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE LEGALIZED HEMP, SAYING IT WOULD HAVE OPENED THE DOOR LEGALIZING MARIJUANA IN THE STATE. BUT THIS WEEK, SHE PRESENTED WHAT SHE CALLED GUARDRAILS ON HEMP MOVING FORWARD. THEY ARE CALLING ON LAWMAKERS TO ADDRESS ENFORCEMENT REGULATION, TRANSPORTATION AND FUNDING PLAN. WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PROSPECT FOR THE UPCOMING SEASON. Reporter: SOUTH DAKOTA LAWMAKERS GIVE INDUSTRIAL HEMP MUCH BETTER ODDS OF PASSING THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNOR APPEARS OPEN TO BE OPEN TO ITS LEGALIZATION ON A CERTAIN CONDITION. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE WITH THAT. Reporter: THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER WARNED AGAINST LEGALIZATION LAST YEAR. SHE DOES AND DECIDED ABOUT IT THIS SESSION. SHE THINKS THE POTENTIAL IN SOUTH DAKOTA IS OVERSOLD. IT IS A MINUTE PART OF OUR MARKET. AGRICULTURE IS A BIG PART OF OUR ECONOMY, BUT NOT A LOT OF FARMERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GROWERS. Reporter: LATE LAST YEAR, THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RELEASED FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR HEMP PRODUCERS TO FOLLOW-UP. MANY LAWMAKERS SAY HEMP IS ARRIVING IN THE THE WHOLE TIME THE LEGISLATOR SHOULD NOT BE STANDING ON THE WAY. WE CAN START PROCESSING HEMP AND SEE IF WE LEGALIZE IT RIGHT HERE. GO TO COSTCO AND YOU CAN BUY A BAG OF HEMP SEED. THEY ARE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH DAKOTA. Reporter: THE RAMP UP PRODUCTION PLANS, SUPPORTERS OF LEGALIZATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA SAY THE STATE CAN AFFORD TO MISS OUT ON THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE NEW CASH CROP. WE HAVE INDUSTRIES THAT WANT TO DO THIS, BUT IF THEY CANNOT DO IT IN SOUTH DAKOTA, THEY WILL DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I WOULD LOVE THE JOBS TO BE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH DAKOTA. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES OF LEGALIZATION WILL BE FINDING THE FUNDING FOR STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT.

it's at 36 percent cac terpenes are lemony mercy and pineapple and as you can see it still comes in a bag this time we didn't get the box i still think riviera creek should change the packaging to maybe some type of jar i do like the box riviera creek this is my first time trying the garlic cookies at 36 percent i've tried many other batches i think i've bought like 15 bags total of garlic cookies since october of last year so i've definitely had success with this particular strain it's been good for my pain and anxiety and it's also been useful for me in the evening the buds are pretty much average size buds for this type of product as far as with frivolour creek they're not bad but um they could always uh be bigger but uh it's only 2.8 so i say they're pretty giving me some pretty nice size nugs here the smell is pretty much the same even though i've noticed the terpene profile percentages have declined over time i definitely give this one a 90 on the mastermind score and if

provide big benefits and make them and the state lots of money as 25 News reporter Dennis Turner shows us they say hemp could easily replace or complement a Texas staple Lisa Martinez and Barbie Nichols describe themselves as farmers of the new cotton they grow hemp a non-narcotic cousin to marijuana which they say can do anything cotton can do and more we're gonna be doing building Wednesday they and farmers from around the state came to give input on how Texas should promote and regulate hemp farming so we know that lobbyists work with them we know that you know groups groups and organizations work with government to put these regulations in place we need to make sure that the little guys heard they believe their crop has potential we think that like the cotton farming can be replaced with him farming or at least supplement cotton and the Texas AG Commissioner agrees our goal is to have the best hemp program in the United States but policy makers farmers and police have to have a common frame of reference it's kind of like the 1920s we're ending prohibition if you're a pothead and you think this is for you it's not I promise among the big topics what to do with crops that get stressed by water or heat sending the plant into hot or defense mode where it might produce the narcotic THC Fannie Tom TDA opens up something like this to hear the farmers opinion you know it's it's good to jump in on that right now the state wants to destroy those crops but these farmers say let them sanitize it and use it we would love to buy the hot cops and just turn them into housing supplies so it can build a new economy that will help a growing Texas Dennis Turner 25 News Miller will take the ideas presented today and discuss them with his 24 member Advisory Council", "V_OLCJGpjEc": "alright guys so what happens when your dog eats over a dozen pot cookies now I hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead you poor thing baby

anyway what i'm reviewing today is delta 8 kush infused him flowers see this isn't just natural in the plant you have to concentrate the delta eight and uh pretty much it's buds that are covered with strong teeth and oils and they smell quite nice it was 20 bucks for 10 grams and if you smell it let me show you i know you can't smell it but there's heaven it's the smell of heaven i know these things don't that ate kush i just smoked some a little bit ago so i figure i'm gonna tell you the details on what i'm feeling squirrel never mind anyway back to what i was saying this delta 8 is quite powerful it's not like an illegal uh if you know what i mean uh i haven't done it in so long yeah i don't care to do it again especially not with stuff like this out on the market delta eight kush now that is spectacular the smoothness is a 10 taste is a 10. uh the effects are 10. uh it fits three-fourths of the way between cbd at the bottom and at the top there would be thc it's about three quarters up it has all the effects and benefits of cbd in fact it does have cbd in it here it is right there [Music] 240 milligram 240 240 milligrams of cbd and 80 milligrams of delta eight this is really good stuff uh will reveal where i'm getting it from eventually uh to be honest i kind of don't want a lot of people to know until i'm stocking up on it you know what i mean because i expect this [ __ ] to be a hot seller when more people know about it and uh yeah that kind of wants me a little reserve of it but in the next couple of days i'll make an order then i'll show you and tell you where i got it from because i want to be fair cbd hemp direct anyway i do like botanicals is this a botanical no i don't know what this is oh it's hemp yeah okay we're doing this uh sorry i keep seeing animals it's beautiful in the mornings see an animal moving and it's just doing its natural thing and you're just watching it's a beautiful feeling it really is anyway the taste 10 all of it 10 is a solid 10 down the road down the line solid 100 percent delicious delicious delicious and for those who don't get it i was joking about not telling you because i said tv him direct okay um i guess it's not not that much of a joke if you have to explain it or maybe it is such a good joke you have to explain it philosophy anyway i've said it anyway about 20 times take a shot every time i say anyway you'll be drunk by now i am having a trip i am tripping i am tripping the hell out this is good [ __ ] this is real good [ __ ] it's not like thc i can actually remember stuff of course i'm easily distracted right now that's just my morning time activities being easily distracted wearing my coat because it's chilly chilly outside that mentioned i love y'all lately i think y'all for watching and doing y'all's thing y'all are awesome and that works that works man it's the dippy and he's kind of lost in thought how long have i been rumbling rambling let me see here six minutes feel that long oh it's a bird is that a bird behind me let me check is it no okay i thought it was a bird behind me i just don't want it to poop on me i am not a car sir not a lot of squirrels anyway see take another shot okay before i ramble too much i'm gonna break down the effects uh you feel happier you're definitely happier easily distracted i definitely wouldn't drive after i smoked that's a no-no that's no no i would say if you have free time to go for a walk you're not impaired where you're falling and laughing and all that goofy [ __ ] you're just kind of happier you're hurting a lot less take it from me who hurts a fair amount uh this really helps on the pain on a different level than cbd does it just makes everything okay it's a slight i hate to say hi it's not really a high it's more of a a chill have you ever been really relaxed really chill just going about your business that's the way i feel i love this i'm going to be getting a lot more please don't buy it up save

the co-founder of high water farm and we are a dry farm in the eel River Valley on the fertile alluvial floodplain and so I grow my entire cannabis crop from the day it is planted until the end of the season without the use of any water or irrigation and so I'm going to do a very quick kind of overview about dry farming and my personal practices and then we'll go to question and answer because that's usually kind of what everyone wants to know is are you serious you never water how do you do that so a little history about me I am a second-generation cannabis culture community member and I have grown cannabis with water and potting soil many times in my life so this was new to me are you guys hearing that buzz sound yeah no okay over here so for the last 18 years my husband and I my family and I have been up on the Klamath mountains in kind of a thousand thousand feet elevation kind of traditional super small medical cannabis garden style we grew traditional no-till on farm inputs really kind of classic and organic super small-scale farming and through the regulated cannabis process in Humboldt County the Yurok tribe has a zero tolerance policy within a mile of the Klamath and we our property was within that zone and so we were forced to relocate ourselves and I ended up with this really beautiful amazing opportunity to come back to the ER ever Valley and I was born on the \u00eele River so it really felt like this coming home moment and in coming to the eel River Valley the practices in my neighborhood and my Appalachian or my terroir where I there's a Shively Holmes and Laribee and the eel river kind of flows through those three property of neighborhoods and those neighborhoods have historically and traditionally produced food for the community through from indigenous days to the lumber camps and to today and so primary the last 20 years it's been mostly in hay production and in small farms vegetable farms and everyone that lives there the joke is you can tell when someone is new because they water their garden and that's kind of the joke in the neighborhood and so when I moved to the e-l River Valley I was scared to implement dry farming practices on my cannabis and I felt like there was a lot on the line with the regulated process and and all of the you know things that I couldn't just take this leap put my plants in the ground on a hope and prayer and hope that they would survive so what I did in 2015 1 2016 is we we observed the land we observe the practices and we tried to acquaint ourselves with our neighborhood and with the soil and with everything that was going on in our neighborhood with the seasons we watched the clouds we marked down the dry and wet days we marked down foggy days and sunny days and we tried to learn this new terroir that we were in and in 2016-2017 we implemented technology that was going to help me to transition to dry farming so that I could understand what was really going on so the locals they have you know stories about ok when the when the cloud forms on the top of this mountain that's when you plant in the ground and when you do this and when you do that and I was really nervous about that and so I ended up using enlisting the help of an agronomist and that agronomist put in some technology on the farm a lysimeter some tensiometer 's some weather stations and so what these weather stations did is they were 24 hours a day monitoring wind speed wind direction humidity high and low temperatures and the the Vice limiters and the tensiometer 's in the ground the lysimeter was measuring the evapotranspiration the amount of water that was coming up through the soil and what the 10th and the 10th eahhh meters were measuring the tension the surface tension of the soil and so what it showed me and we just did a test patch so I'm new to my valley I want to make that disclaimer and I was following in the footsteps of sunshine Johnston who transitioned to dry farming the year before me and then Bill Reynolds and eel river produce and some dear friends of mine Sean and Jane at dry farmed organic medicinals and really watching them and seeing what they were doing so I took the lead more with technology and they took the lead more with faith and both worked out so what I ended up seeing in the technology was that everything that they said that when the Sun was at the highest when we were in the most drought conditions that my plants were going to get the most water and that if I just had faith that when the Sun hit the bare soil and the water would come up through the ground and the evapotranspiration would come through and those water vapor gases would water my plants and so I watched it I observed it and I saw it and I saw by knowing the plan and knowing that the plant was not suffering and that the plant was not thirsty and so we did some test patches the first year and then this year we converted the entire 20,000 square feet to dry farming and it was awesome so so a lot of the techniques that are involved in dry farming you are counterintuitive to someone who not your soil and cares for soil and soil health and so from someone who practiced no-till and on-farm inputs and just all of these really groovy worm castings and groovy practices for all these years here in the dry farming of the river valley it's all about creating this layer on top of the soil that is conducive to pulling that water up from down below so we had to till until like ireally till the soil pretty strongly and all the way until ideally it would be like marbles or peas and beach sand that's kind of how fine I want the sand to be and the soil to be and then it's like it creates a dust mulch layer on top other things that I have always practiced sour like beneficial plantings and companion plantings and it was also a tricky thing because when you're dealing with dry farming you want to make sure that your plant has all of the available area around it to receive those water gases and you want the Sun the soil to be exposed to the Sun so when the Sun hits that exposed soil that's when the water comes up through and waters the plants when you start having a lot of cover crop and a lot of stuff in your rows you end up not being able to get the water to come up in the way that it should so we do do some companion planting because we do it for beneficials and we do it for the love but we definitely have had to gear more towards a mono crop style in the cannabis garden in particular and to really just lean into dry farming cannabis and learn how that works so when we prepared the soil we tilled in these beds and we just grow in 100% native soil there's no there are some dry amendments that I put in the year before but last year we added no dry amendments and we tilled the soil really well most of the fertility comes from cover cropping in the wintertime and then we till the soil and we plant the plants about 3 feet on center you know every every three feet we plant the plants there kind of roll through a little bit this is putting some amendments in the year before there's the plants when we plan to them that's about how close they were we planted them pretty tight this year I'll give you a quick let me see what time it is they'll give you a quick little history of my Valley where I am the the red crest lumber mill is up here and in 1964 when the flood happened the eel River makes a really hard 90-degree turn at my valley and so when the 1964 flood happened the log jams and everything from the lumber mill kind of stacked up stocked up stacked up and when the 64 flood came through they flooded out the whole entire valley wiping out Shively homes and Laribee and when they did that they left behind all the sawdust all the red wood slack all this stuff and 11 feet of sediment on top and that's the sediment that I grow in so it's a giant Hugo culture swell and it is super super filled with nutrient it's really nutrient rich and really beautiful it's a blessing to get to be there and to watch nature do the work so we practice a lot of the one straw revolution kind of type work farming here so there's the plants when we first planned to them when we planted them we had 17 days straight and have like 35 mile an hour winds I was not expecting it it was not good for dry farming and my plants were laying on the ground on the 4th of July and my friends came over for a party and I they were all looking at me like cool crystal nice farm good idea yeah that's weird and then I had another party in the middle of August and everyone came back and was like oh my god this is the Garden of Eden like how did you make it through that so I let the plants lay down I let the wind go and eventually when they tapped in and when the water happened they when the Sun really hit the ground and the water started coming up through the soil they recovered and here is my garden let's see if I can find oh there's somebody in my garden here's the garden in the middle of summer there's the garden in the middle of summer there's some more pictures we had a farm-to-table dinner and this is farm-to-table dinner here's some Jessi bio vortex strains there's some gelato kind of close to the end of the season there's some friends there here's some of our biodiversity and that's kind of it so I'll open it up to questions answers we guys have any questions about dry farming mainly I will tell you that you can implement dry farming practices in any type of terroir that you're in but you can't necessarily dry farm this is a really unique place and a really unique situation that we have being in the alluvial soil and in the River floodplain it's not a technique or a tactic that I have figured out that I've cracked the code like its lucky yeah so go ahead so he told me he's seen some dry farms and he wants to know about the transition period this is how long is it that you don't sleep from when you plant it to when the plants stand up and I would say that it's it's eight serious days and after the eighth serious day it's about fifteen days total before they're looking like you want to have your friends over and check out your plants you know Mary would you say eight nine days is that where yeah some some do take right away and some of the mints I'll tell you about some of the myths a lot of the myths I've heard about dry farming were that you need to plant seeds they need to have tap roots and they need to go really deep into the river ground you know that is not what happens with this type of dry farming you can grow clones you can you can you do need to pay attention to timing you know so that your plants aren't out there in the heat without any you know experience with getting used to it yet and a really big root ball I learned that the bigger healthier plants that I transplanted into the ground did worse than the small plants because they had more in the nursery stage that they'd been watered and they had more to need watered and so the smaller plants and the four inches when they went in they adjusted a lot better than the bigger plants and so really the main thing is recognizing that the plants aren't tapping in anywhere that you're encouraging the moisture up through the soil by exposing the bare soil to the Sun and so no mulching no covering yes thing yeah so he's saying composting things from your native from your local area and only using that in your soil really helps I yeah when I was a compost tea brewer and got to do all these awesome cool things before I didn't water I used to always pull material from underneath my healthiest trees in the garden underneath my healthiest stuff in the wilderness around me and throw that in my compost tea brewer hoping that I would encourage those local you know microorganisms to grow in my in my compost yes so have we done in microbial soil counts oh no we have not done that Michael yes I've done very extensive soil testing so right now I'm not going to go right off the top and try to remember the numbers or anything we increase the organic matter in our soil just by dry farming and bringing the roots and you know kind of changing from the hey that was there in one year more than I think I think UC Davis said it's not possible to increase the organic matter without adding a bunch of stuff the way that you have and so that was one thing that was really good but what I did learn through my testing and through the research that we done on the farm is that a lot of the materials that I was adding and was believing to be really good for my soil and really awesome in the end when I actually weighed and compared and measured it was not significant at all and not even significant enough for me to justify the purchase of those amendments and the application of those amendments yes you know we did do a little bit of foliar spraying we came under thrips pressure at the very end of the season somewhere around September 14th we came under thrips and they came in like a nightmare like from nothing to a full nightmare so we did do a little bit of foliar spraying to try to manage and hold back the thrips because we don't use foliar and because we haven't been watering we use a lot of beneficial predator a tree as predator mites and predators on there I do feel like I might have disrupted the balance a little bit this year by not using predators as an afterthought and using predators early in the season I might have disrupted a natural balance and that would be why the thrips got away from themselves so sorry to anyone who might find that offensive but no in the nursery we foot we water kind of regularly we start the seeds we have the clones we kind of water relatively regularly in the nursery space and then we do pull back that last week or two before planting just so that they kind of get prepared and we did do some where we did not water in the holes at all and we did some where we watered in the holes at planting and I they both did fine I think the watering in the holes softened that 8 day to 15 day transition time but I would have to do a yield data and a comparison to figure out whether that work was worth it in the long run yes yeah it's silty clay loam it's it's more silty than clay but it's pretty clay in my Valley because of the 64 flood and the way it came through and I can't even say the 64 flood through millennia it's been flooding there but at Sunshine's farm she's just down the maybe a mile down the road from me not even a half mile down the road same flood plain her soil is much more clay than mine mine is much more silty loam and even in different spaces in my garden I don't have the the right side but behind this table to the left side there is it's an l-shaped garden and that l-shaped garden on that side I can dig with my hand all the way to my shoulder you'll never find a rock nothing I mean you'll never find a rock you can just dig with my shoulder with my hand on the other side it's a little bit more dense and I think that more has to do with where alfalfa was grown and where Bermuda grass has taken over and like the impact from tractors over the years on the soil I don't know what our water table drops down to at the late-summer but our lice emitters are set at four feet three feet two feet and four inches and on the hottest days of the summer my field we'll hit field capacity which will look as if I'd watered with two hundred and ten thousand gallons and so it's pretty major it's a lot of water that comes up in in vapour form I would imagine that the water table is probably anywhere between 12 and 20 feet deep and it's shallowest I get mottled clay around around 36 inches 48 inches is where I start to get kind of mottled color looking clay which indicates the presence of water I do believe that it's the water table and the presence of the water table and the soil structure so if I were in bedrock and then building soil on top of bedrock and I didn't know where the water table was below me or how deep I would question the ability for the same rate of evapotranspiration but it happens it is nature and it does happen and especially if you were to capture slow it sink it spread it and capture groundwater by creating hue goals by creating swales and by creating places on your property where you're capturing the rainwater and sinking it where it is I would imagine that with those practices you could get enough water to dry farm from in the summertime and and one thing I'll say about farming without water is that the addition of water and the addition of nitrogen to our soil brings a lot of pests a lot of the issues that we deal with with powdery mildew with spider mites with Russert mites with all of these things are they thrive in high nitrogen environments they thrive in wet and moist they thrive when we're feeding the plants more than the plants need to eat and so what I've learned through this practice is that I always watered too much and that finding the minimum effective water that you could give to your plants you would be creating a more resilient plant and a you're reducing the impacts of the negative aspects of mold and mildew and bugs yes Mary it does she's talking about the specific hole that I have at my place the Holmes hole where this 90-degree angle goes where there's a huge rock wall and at that rock wall we have a hundred foot deep swimming hole and it's just sand and this swimming hole that is otters sturgeon it's something on the \u00eele River that you wouldn't even believe existed anymore you know and it is amazing it's about 40 feet deep at its lowest in the whole year yeah and so that water is all in our zone can you come over again well there's not yellow leaves there's not brown hairs because they're in veg and vegetative state this the no II don't water and flower and ever but once the once the action starts to take place the hottest days of the summer all through the summer is when I get the most water so like I said if it hits 90 degrees or 95 degrees the top 4 inches of my soil will look as if I'd watered with 210 thousand gallons so no they're not thirsty they don't look thirsty when you go out in the morning the leaves are praying just like they just got watered at the end of the day the leaves are tired just like they're ready to go to bed I don't feed them anything no it's pretty amazing my farm is on the Avenue of the Giants and readcrest in homes you can find us at high-water farm high4 water underscore farm and it is open for people to come on by and check it out during the summer months and see for themselves doing what right next to my garden my events cross-contamination yeah my plants like people and people like my plants I think I had around a thousand people through the garden this year we had four different community events on the farm we had a couple concerts and a couple other things go down and I will tell you that no is my typical answer I do have a washbucket and I take people through kind of as they come in I kind of encourage a culture of mine of mindfulness around being clean but I did have a thrips infestation so yeah people bring things but I don't know if they could have come from my onions yes oh we do till the soil every single year it's part of our farming practices so at the end of the season when the field is finished ITIL I cut the base the stocks at the base I compost the stocks and I till the field and broadcast the cover crop and then if I'm lucky and we get a January or February where we get three weeks of no nothing I'll till that cover crop in and plant another one and so that that's pretty much it I have only got to do that once we'll see the first year I was there it was really really wet last year was really dry so we'll see how it goes this year but I think that's it are there any more questions thank you guys so much [Applause]", "DSijrXru-xA": "this is showing our spray test this is the starting material spray method one spray method two this is much more white this one's probably our favorite and this is the

tell in the video let's see here in the video this looks better because it's brighter but in person this method looks the most like cannabis it's hard to to tell on the video no it's a better piece maybe and again this is what it looked like to start", "PX3c1o3bvW8": "yo yo yo what's good you guys welcome to a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh yeah that works in this life so clean we have a special announcement from dell technologies black

[ __ ] gave me the forest whitaker eye damn [Music] go i hope that everything goes good man [Music] christoph kristoff 54 big up de france i don't speak french i just made that [ __ ] up i think that's probably how you read that [ __ ] as you can tell i learned my french from dexter's laboratory i'm led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "_-R-Oe1NpYY": "what is hemp flour in this video i'm going to tell you exactly what that is and i'm going to tell you that even though

you're going to feel in your body and i'm going to tell you about terpenes which determine the smell and stinkiness of the flower so when you go shopping for flour online you're going to be able to find the best stinkiest flower that just really smacks so without rambling too much i'm gonna get right into it my name's chris with cbd extract.co i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and what i can tell you from my experience is that the words hemp marijuana and cannabis all mean the same thing technically but thanks to our good old buddy donald trump he now made federal legal definitions for these terms for example marijuana is defined as any cannabis product that has more than 0.3 percent delta 9 thc now we're not talking about thca we're not talking about delta 8 thc and we're not talking about any other form of thc we're only talking about delta nine so if it's above that threshold it's marijuana so and that's really weird because on a federal level that's a controlled substance it's a schedule one controlled substance so it's up there with meth heroin crack cocaine whatever those drugs are i don't know specifically because i don't do those drugs but what i do know is that it's in the same category which is totally bogus and messed up but what's crazy is that hemp is defined as less than 0.3 delta 9 thc so what that means is that all the other cannabinoids like cbg cbn thca delta athc these are all compounds that have free reign to be bought sold and shipped over state borders on a federal level it's completely legal and usps will actually ship this no problem they will not confiscate your product as long as it has a lab test in the package now what this means for you is you can literally go on google right now you can go on google right now and type in hempflower or delta8thc or cbg and you can literally buy products that look like marijuana but are completely legal to be bought and shipped to your house that is literally crazy that's insane so and as a matter of fact if you want to get your hands on some indoor flour you can get an eighth totally for free at cbdxrack.co we actually give a free eighth of our greenhouse or indoor grown flower completely for free all you got to do is hit the link below so definitely check that out um it you got nothing to lose it's totally free we covered the pot all you got to do is cover the postage but anyways to figure out if the product is legal or not so it's actually safe to be shipped because keep in mind marijuana is illegal to be shipped over state borders you don't want to send marijuana over the border or buy it accidentally online and then you get caught and get in trouble so what you need to do is look at the lab test and so i'm going to pop this up on the screen right now but if you look at the lab test you'll see the triangle 9 thc as long as that percentage right there is less than 0.3 you're in the clear and it's considered hemp um if it's over obviously it's marijuana that's considered hot hot hemp as they call it and completely illegal unless you live in a recreational state so um and keep in mind like i said total thc doesn't matter on a federal level um the thca doesn't matter delta a thc cbg cbn none of that matters only the delta nine so keep that in mind i know i'm like a broken record at this point with the delta nine stuff but that's literally just how it works um so if you want to find the best quality this is the we need to look at because we're already looking at the lab test i might as well teach you how to get the best quality hemp flower there's a lot of people there's a lot of crappy dirty ditch wheat out there but basically if you look at the lab test you'll see the total cannabinoid percentage cannabinoid cannabinoid i don't know everyone says it different but basically the higher that percentage is the more you're going to feel so for example if you have a high cbd flower it's going to be relaxing if you have a high cbg flower it's going to be more stimulating because cbg is considered a non-psychoactive stimulant some people react to it differently they don't know too much about it but obviously each cannabinoid has a different effect cbn it's actually slightly psychoactive and it um makes you sleepy all right and then obviously if you have a high thca product when you smoke that thca it turns into delta 9 thc so obviously it gets you high same thing with delta 8 thc okay so basically you can buy these products online okay so if you want to get the products that really smack because a lot of people say oh hemp flour kind of sucks like it doesn't really make me feel like anything you need to get a higher percentage flower okay it's really that simple it works just like the medical industry with marijuana the higher the percentage the more you're going to feel and like i said you have different ratios of the cannabinoids the the percentages of them the next thing you want to look at in terms of the smell is going to be the terpenes now the terpenes are essentially the oils found in the bud that give it that pungent smell so if you're smelling pine you're smelling skunk you're smelling weird marijuana smells or whatever you know it just smells like weed in general that's a result of the terpenes and these terpenes actually indicate whether or not it's indica or sativa so for example uh limonene is considered a sativa uh terpene and mercine is considered a indica so if you look at the lab test you can see which terpenes are dominant that actually determines what effects are going to feel because these terpenes actually indicate um how you're gonna feel right they bind to your receptors in the same way that cannabinoids do so it's really crazy and one more thing to look out for when you're shopping for hemp flour online is don't just go off the pictures because you're gonna see these big dank beautiful buds you're gonna see like all these reviews and stuff but you might get it in the mail if you're going at it blindly and you'll be like man these buds are like dull smelling they don't really do anything they kind of smoke it i got a throat itch and a headache you don't want that so always look at the lab test right because the lab test is like your safeguard to make sure you're getting quality product you don't want to be wasting your money you don't want to smoke dirty ditchweed and also you want to see on the lab test if there's panel testing for pesticides because who knows maybe they're selling pesticide hemp flour you need to protect yourself so always look at the lab test and that's pretty much it so hemp flour yeah it actually can get you high if you buy a certain type of product just have in general you can get high if you buy a certain type of product but really guys it's just so simple if you want to feel good look at the lab test check the cannabinoids and the terpenes and you're going to get good product so that's pretty much it i hope you enjoyed this video and like i said if you want access to indoor and greenhouse grown flower hit the link below we're doing a free eighth promo uh there's nothing for you to lose all you gotta do is hit the link if you're from the us you qualify if you're from the uk or another country uh we do not do shipping internationally so sorry guys but that's it i'm

whatnot [Music] there came out super frosty they're ready to go look delicious [Music] so I'm gonna get in here and start cutting these ladies down it's been a good little a really good throw here all right you [Music] all right just kind of want to give you guys a shot the harvest here get an idea of how these babies are curing out we are see Friday [Music] about four days in you just container them been on the rack Kiran on the right here we've got the this is the Kemp or [Music] bulgy [Music] [Music] we got this [ __ ] she did really well real nice and frosty the buds are super dense it will dance buds real nice and tricky looking really good came out beautiful love this stuff smells awesome l feel good then be alien this was the performer by far good good mistakes [Music] but is just littered in trikes can't even it's hard to almost make out the structure is just so tricky really nice numbers were good I liked the yield was really nice came out real well nice tighter bud here these are just as dense they're gonna be nice and nice and sticky there already are sticky but not bad stuff this stuff came out solid then what you're looking at here is already live resin of the alien oh gee it's that there and on the right there's some live resin of the chem dog over here here's the alien OG came out real nice who's the chem not bad either [Music] and check out the yield here so overall alien did 13 point all right excuse me eleven point three ounces and the chem dog combined those three plants combining me fourteen point six so we had a total of one point six pounds twenty nine twenty five point nine ounces there's kind of a breakdown of everything did it by plant and yeah yeah you know the alien did uh almost as good as the three combined so despite that it was still a nice yield out of that little little tent we got there so it's kind of why it got the little delay in the video I want to kind of get a post-harvest look at these buds and how their father Kieran out how they look come on come it off the camera will play nice here and get another nice close-up did real good I'm hoping to do a little bit better next time McKim dogs like I said only about 4 ounces of plant and the 4 to 5 ounce to the plant best real quality stuff but I really like this stuff I like the live resin I'm interested to try out the smoke see how it smokes but ya came out pretty good", "GK3BRhdni3s": "all right I have something else to go off of here something I also wanted to tell you guys I forgot to put it on the last video but the CBD hemp flour we had discussed about how this had if you smoke it you will fail a drug test that is obviously inclusive so I want to tell you guys a little story and background story about how I came across this and what happened one day with so one day I was I bought it and there was an officer in the parking lot and you know and a buddy of mine wondering like you know because it's real bud if we had gotten caught or stopped with this stuff in our truck could we go to jail for having it even though it's being sold in the store and you don't have to have any kind of you know prescription or anything for it you just walk into a convenience store and buy it then it's real but in there it's real but it's definitely real bud well I gave it to the officer and the officer was like you know it's tarnished and I walked up to him with with weed and I even showed him the bottle and I told him I just bought it and one of the bye I wanted to know if I would go to jail if they had found something like this in my trunk and so he takes a kit out it was like this little weird a glow stick almost and he put it inside and then he cracked it and he said if this comes back purple that'll prove that it's real bud and you know usually comes up being a light purple and then all of a sudden you know a darker gets them a potent it is well he cracked it and no lie this thing turned from light purple and then also a new way purple purple too purple to almost where you couldn't even see purple no more it was black almost this thing was so purple it was so purple and he said yeah absolutely if I had caught this in your truck and I had pulled you over and this was in your truck you would either be getting a ticket if I was a nice cop or you'd be going to jail if it was you know a cop that wasn't more understanding that you had bought this he said you would definitely be going to jail for it because there's a quarter as a quarter in there at 7 grand a quarter so um yeah you would go to jail so if you have this in your trunk and they test it if you get a bad cop man or a cop that just having a bad day or is not understanding that you bought this from the store got a prescription and you don't need one because it's under 0.3% THC which is allows them to sell it if you get caught man with this stuff you're going to jail you can go to jail for this stuff so just letting you know because some cops are not aware that you're allowed that they're allowed to sell it because it's under 0.3 THC level and they don't have them I mean they're not gonna research the you know the state statue at that very moment you're gonna go to jail then you're gonna have to prove your innocence in court which is gonna tie you up a lot but so just be careful with this", "ZjGxzw3BfxE": "[Music] sheriff's deputies in

have an awesome episode for you guys here today or at least i hope it will be awesome uh i think it will be awesome uh the over the last three four weeks we've discussed uh farming in in the uk and europe and you know producing a cbd extract and farming hemp and the laws around there and we met uh george from george botanicals from uh sativa wellness group who told us all about uh you know his processes and what he's doing with farming in europe and trying to bring a x-ray to the uk and how it's how there are still laws which make it very difficult unless you're gmp compliant however there's still a lot of cbd products on the market and most of our extracts are sourced from america so today that's what we've done uh before i dive head first into the episode because i can literally i could do that let's just get a quick word from our sponsor then i'll give my introduction and then we'll go from there i'm sure you've heard before that good quality cbd needs to be really really

you get tempo you mentioned men's radio 10 get 10 percent off yeah off to the races okay so yeah like i'm saying over the few weeks we've discussed growing hemp and manufacturing cannabinoid extracts in the uk and how it's a very controlled limited market you can't you know jamie barley was telling us that you can grow hemp here but you can't actually extract anything from it so what a lot of people do in europe is they'll grow their hemp in europe and ship off to america or ship off to a country where extraction is legal uh the the guest we have today a guy called chris stubbs he comes from he comes from kentucky uh his company is called gen kanna over the last seven eight years uh jen kenner has been a very stable supplier of of extracts of the uk now let me tell you a little story seven years ago five six seven years ago six years ago i went to america i went to go visit my brother my brother was living in l.a at the time and when i went out to l.a i was in my buddy's shop and he comes up he goes check out these products someone's just giving me bro brian puts a lip balm in front of me and i remember i'm looking at this lip balm and i just basically saw something i saw a different application for cannabinoids and i'd seen previously i've seen something which has almost multi-purpose use it could be used for different things it kind of got my brain working uh over the course of that trip i met uh a few people you know and my eyes kind of got open to the world of cbd and you know like understanding it a bit more of course i'd heard about it but i mean just understanding it more when i got back from america i reached out to my brother i was like look i need to get my hands on some of that you know i reckon i could make those products you know i reckon i can make something similar or better i can't seem to find anything you know the biggest issue six five six years ago was finding a product that actually worked for me it was finding something which was reliable and accurate and consistent and i couldn't find that still to this day a lot of people are having trouble finding it i just have myself which makes my life a hell of a lot easier now the first extracts i ever used were made by my guest today now this is all just kind of like this was this all came out in our little conversation you know like our pre-show conversation you know you've been at the company for when did you start what were you doing blah blah blah you know like because you know companies have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of employees you know sometimes it's you know sometimes you just get someone you don't get the right one and it's it's pretty awesome that you know chris has been you know chris is a real scientist you know he's been involved in this industry for like 20 years but he's been with john kennedy for like six seven and like i said my original products the first products i ever designed the first capsules the first tinctures the first body oils bath bombs lotions creams i ever made were using an extract that chris made and i don't know there's something quite romantic there you know like i'll be honest with you it's made me a little bit more nervous for the show i don't know what it is it's just made it a little bit more i think synergies like this kind of i'll tell you what it is he's american and if you piss him off he'll invade your house that's mean don't be rude that is right that is a fact i am the one who makes inappropriate comments you're not allowed to you you're the balancer you're supposed to hold this down man i just wondered why you were nervous he seems like we were chatting before the show he seems just an absolutely lovely not nervous in that way but it's kind of like it brings back a whole bunch of memories it's like you know i'm sitting on a show now seven years down the line i'm about to have a guest who is the guy who made the extracts that i first started this journey on with there's something quite romantic there you know there's it's like a beautiful synergy that's what it is it's beautiful synergy so let me carry on my introduction anyway before i start my little tangent so basically chris stubbs uh over the last seven years has basically helped genkena uh create this reliable consistent extract which has given them the formidable market position which they have in the uk and it which has given manufacturers like myself the ability to provide end users like yourselves the products which you are so reliant on now the products that you find to be consistent and reliable and the ones which you know will work for you week on and week out they usually have a backbone which is stronger than the manufacturer you know like with with me i've got companies like jen kenner behind me and you know who supply me the extract which enabled me to supply you the products which are great and there's this this pyramid you know what i mean like in the foundation of every incredible product out there is a farm the role of every farm in this marketplace the role of every farm out there producing cannabinoids is to produce a reliable consistent cannabinoid okay it's not it's all well and good just growing hemp and creating an extract but you need to be able to create the same extract over and over and over again so your customers can provide the same products that their end users over and over and over again so chris like i said has been doing this for a very long time he's responsible for billions and billions of milligrams of cbd you know like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of kilos which have you know which which the world has consumed chris is responsible for the manufacture of those and you know like it's just it it's an incredible role it's an incredible incredible wow sorry um it it's an incredible thing when you think about it that you know you have only a few of these companies as a manufacturer i can tell you there are only few farms who are operating on this level and there are only a few farms who can provide this consistency and you know there aren't that many that there aren't that many suppliers of of this sort of extract and you know with pending novel food and you know potential reclassification about cannabinoids and a general unsteady uncertain unreliable market anyway it's nice to know that you've got something which is reliable amidst all of this chaos you could say and it's nice to know you've got someone you know something which you as end users and me as a manufacturer can rely on in a market that is so fragile and so ever-changing and you know and a market which faces so many hurdles that you know it's it's actually crazy how many people come and go from this industry and you know how much inconsistency there is so you know like like the the topic of today is is bringing a consistent compliant product extract to the uk market and let's bring out chris dubs and it's not what i'd like to do ollie because i've been in this game since 1984 and i've never been able to say this live from kentucky never been able to say that before nice one rat thank you sorry about that chris i think i think olly got a bit over him i got emotional there chris it's like there are stories coming up you know because i think you've seen uh i'm not going to do psych on you but i think you saw how far you've gone from just having a notion to where you are now which i think is just a fabulous thing it's been a long time that's another that's another story for a different thing what i love you is you're around the corner chris stubbs is in is is in kentucky and he looks like the picture's fantastically clear you see that's american know-how for you every every time every one of the houses no devices for this hour clear as day it is clear it's fantastic it's as clear as the as the as the mars picture gotta love that what a feat of genius that is anyway ollie back to you so chris welcome to the show sorry for my over emotional introduction i really do apologize it's just sometimes things get me okay and i think that was just one of those moments uh thank you very much for joining us and uh you know like thank you very much for supplying us with extract and i'm just gonna fire questions at you because i feel like your brain is something they need to hear so let's just start always my first question how did you get involved in this industry um it's a loaded question ollie but uh really comes from the pursuit of science is is number one top of mind right i started as a scientist or at least the realization i wanted to pursue science really really young and somehow cannabis over my upbringing kept coming into my life mostly through family believe it or not so it started in a very helpful and healthful place and as i as i grew up went through high school went into university i discovered this thing called the endocannabinoid system and how that really was the answer behind why and how this plant works so well for so many of us so i dove in in college had a great mentor that studied the endocannabinoid system allowed me to do um you know pre-clinical uh testing work with cannabinoids and the ecs the endocannabinoid system um and found myself at the end of university being very well positioned to enter the emerging legal medical and recreational cannabis space and it's just it's been an incredible journey the pursuit of science coupled with the ability to help people with a natural product has kept me invigorated and will for the rest of my life i mean this is what i want to do what i've been privileged and humbled to do and my time here at gen canada has taken it from you know a small lab scale to true agronomic and industrial scale and along the way we've attempted to make it as normal as possible to your point about the lip balm i didn't really envision that years ago although in the early days of colorado legalization we saw slurpees cotton candy you know cannabis infused into everything um so i knew that was possible the the global acceptance and consumer packaged goods can cannabinoids have a place and so um my time here has been dedicated to normalization of cbd and hemp derived cannabinoids by positioning the firm our processes our people our products against existing regulatory frameworks to say look we can follow the rules just like anybody else you make soap you make sugar you make vitamin c we make cbd and it's all written down it's all transparent i think that's part of the mystery right the the consumer does not have a understanding of the black boxes between the farm and what they are actually using and we have sought to make that a transparent and respectable process and i think we've done really well for like you said billions of milligrams um have made it to people's homes and to their mouths and to their bodies safely and that that was the primary goal you cannot do this work in a predictable and sustainable fashion without starting at the farm and understanding the end um with it which is consumption when you started growing in kentucky had they just opened up kentucky or were there already farms that were growing there so we knew from my time in colorado and some very humbling and special experiences with children with pediatric epilepsy that uh there was a true unmet need and a true um demand that had just started to be realized and we knew that we had to get outside we knew we had to farm because it's just a scale issue right we can't be trapped in warehouses retrofit to grow cannabis and and grow hundreds of thousands of kilos of product just doesn't work and so we looked for jurisdictions that had either existing laws on the books or well poised to make that leap and when the farm bill passed in 2014 which allowed state departments of agriculture and universities to start to research industrial hemp kentucky was top of mind they had a law in the books that said as soon as the feds passed this law we're ready to go and the department of agriculture said come let's grow a new crop together and figure it out plant plants first ask questions later so that's that's pretty cool so basically you were almost ground breakers in in kentucky as well it wasn't even like that because that's the issue in the uk the issue in the uk is that there's so much uncertainty so you said you know like basically check the black boxes all right at least you have black boxes to check you know you have these you you have these boxes they might be a pain in the ass and there might be a thousand subcategories underneath it but unfortunately in the uk and in europe as you know we were discussing earlier in the week and we've discussed over the last five six weeks with you know with jamie and with uh with uh quentin from spectrums and with uh with george with with all these different farmers with alex last week you know we've i like that the boxes aren't there the framework is okay so you almost have like you always have like the page saying checklist but there's nothing on the checklist here that doesn't mean there's nothing on the checklist it means there's nothing there yet well and we encourage to help make that checklist you know either ourselves or through lobbying efforts you know we've brought regulators and enforcement officials to our facilities time and time again and say look this is how we do this there's no secrets here um i've hosted large delegations from the usda fbi the dea the sheriff's department the cops the judges the clerks i mean and it's it's nerve-wracking from time to time because these are the people that have been on the other side of the coin they want nothing more than what everyone wants which is to help each other be healthful and frankly when they have those experiences with cannabis generally medical rec hemp derived you know i'm going to blur some lines here although our business is very focused on what is federally legal and compliant here in the states and worldwide um when people have that experience it changes their minds and it changes their lives and what do they do they seek that solution over time and i thought you know what better way than to get outside and do this at scale and build refinement facilities and formulations facilities and testing facilities that validated all of that work and allowed us to change people's lives uh so and our italian friends right they've got the ecs too so so so kentucky uh in kentucky when when you kind of brought this you know like we started growing i assume you almost you know created jobs created an infrastructure i assume that these farms you didn't go and cut down a whole bunch of tomato fields and start growing hemp i assumed the farms were you know unused agricultural land and you almost brought a purpose back to you know back to an area which was more purposeless before not saying kentucky's purpose plus it has the best bourbon in the world if it ain't from kentucky you can't call it bourbon there are enough things of you know i i like kentucky okay you know what i mean i i i'm a big fan i don't mean that in a negative way just talking about like in terms of boosting economies i assume you guys did that right well let's give farmers a purpose there's risk in this now what is that's that's russ come on that's tennessee we're from london so we assume that like saying kentucky and tennessee is like croydon and peckham you could get there in 10 minutes it's probably 8 billion miles away i know there's only one color of blue here i'll tell you that much what does that mean there's one that's a good one what does that mean wildcats so years ago uh they're absolutely here we are fanatics for the kentucky wildcats and and that's a certain shade is that baseball roller derby roller derby yes yeah roll is definitely roller derby i i saw a documentary on this the some fans are going to come set fire to my house this is not good like the wildcats like of london they're going to come kill me i love you wild cats go cats it's good it's just there's there's definitely ride just like with football like there are lines here that you don't cross and i i showed up i showed up to a meeting with a uh more of a north carolina blue on not a deep kentucky wildcat 41 and i got some looks i got some i'm joking i'll tell you what chris when you come in lessons you have to come to the uk when you next come to the uk and we'll all hook up you can come to near where i am and there's a charming and elegant football club called millwall millwall and what are you doing i'll take you into the local pub chris nice to meet the porters and you're gonna go come on arsenal and then i'm gonna run we're gonna teach you a song we're gonna teach a song it's called forever blowing bubbles okay and you're going to walk into millwall singing i'm forever blowing bubbles pretty bubbles in the air we fly so high they reach the sky no seriously how long do you think yeah i was gonna say i'm nerd strong there's a difference between farm strong and listen all credit due to the team right this is not this is not just a me thing this is an incredible effort that takes a lot of uh a lot of time countless hours i mean you spoke with one of my colleagues the other day and we're going to bring this guy on this guy's called chris macaluso is that right that i pronounced that right macaluso that's right yeah chris macalester he is an incredible green-blooded farmer we're going to bring them on in a few weeks time uh i basically i i chat with them together i was like we need to split this there's there's too much going on uh but yeah so so chris will be here in a few weeks time and he really is just like his brain is just like whoa it's like a you know like a 20 like a magical botanist he's like a botany wizard you know like gandalf the botanist you know brands together and you've got gen canna and you've got a global supply of cannabinoids i mean it's it's been a very humbling experience and to your question um we we we didn't do this all ourselves right there was a clear unmet need and still is in farming we just so happen to be oversupplied at the moment but tobacco farms here there's people for generations that have been struggling and looking for new crops and they still are hemp is not the only answer but it's certainly a viable one over time and and we're in this very volatile period where demand and supply and regulations and and global compliance is is still maturing and so what we did was say look you guys know your farm's the best we know cannabis really well why don't we put two and two together and help each other successfully grow this crop so that when we extract it and we refine it and we formulate with it and we come ask for accreditation of our facilities and our farms it's the same it's the same next quarter it's the same next crop year right how is procter gamble going to say sure i'll put this in my product if it's you know different different different so we've been able to normalize that what the farmers here in kentucky we have previously monitored the certified farming network we've been just an amazing group of folks that um have been able to bring this to life and it has allowed us to move downstream and get this into places like the uk by engineering compliance from the very start let's rewind a little bit all right ask your question and then i'm going to i'm a real outsider to this because you know all i've just been a passenger when i first was introduced to ollie and i thought okay i know nothing about this subject so the last 22 weeks have been dazzling for me now he's an active cbd user absolutely his doggy and so his doggy as well exactly proper family cbd family i love it the point i was going to make uh chris is the way that i understand this idea of consistency and this may seem silly but it will make sense is that my guilty pleasure are cuban cigars from havana i know in america that's a problem but not in not over here in london and if you don't get that consistency of the leaf if you don't get that consistency of the tobacco from the great tobacco growers of the havana cigar industry you know it causes a huge furore and you know the word gets out don't have xyz companies this year because it's just it's not good so i totally understand what you're i totally understand what you're getting if it doesn't sound sound too tangential it's it's it's thanks it's um it's really there's a has to be an understanding of one the scale that you're operating at how you validate each part of that process and where your levers are right you might have something that goes wrong in the field you might have something that doesn't quite meet um you know to the nines but we have ways of pulling levers and ensuring that hey you know the output remains the same once again and that's particularly true with purified compounds but you know standardizing extracts is very possible too so that we we maintain that level playing field and that's that's where i think i think olly would agree with me there are certain companies and people that do parts of this really really well and we've had to refocus our own efforts to do parts of it really really well um it's rare to find a much more holistic approach where everything's done really really well wherever you do it um but i and our team are not the kind of people that say we've done it it's all over right this is still maturing and the pursuit of science and the scientific method is knowledge and truth and a lot more to learn brothers a lot more let me just say uh we have a very interactive show here chris so michael adair is saying lord science when he saw him so that's cool uh luke francis shout out to chris and our friends across the pond thank you all which is lovely now a regular to men's radio and this this is the sort of effect that you guys are having this is a chat called barry j allen not the flash but we always call him the flash and when he's on the other show when he's on the daily show we always play the theme tune from flash by queen um anyway here's a question now i've replied but i'd like you're the expert so i'm just the passenger barry allen says here here's a question three years ago i had a brain tumor removed i've still got a bit of it left presuming that's the tumor not your brain now and barry and it's being watched but ever since my sleep is terrible would this help sorry to disturb you you're not disturbing ever no comments are ever disturbing we love having your comments i've written back and said yeah i'm sure it would but i'd like to hear it from an expert like you know i'm just a punter so chris so i i'm gonna have to be a little ambiguous here and i apologize for that because with my position and what we do in the regulatory environment that we're subject to here and even there as manufacturers i can't make a claim on the product right fair enough can't market it in this way but i will say something all i can say no i i was going to finish your point and then like like i'll talk to the dudes i think that the short answer is most definitely probably you know you can't figure it out for yourself until you have a product you can rely on and that's the key with oliver's approach that's the key with our just saying yeah here's a product that could potentially help you now we're gonna give you some guidance on how to figure that out because frankly some folks are sensitive to cbd like they are to caffeine and they have to figure you know taking it no past eight o'clock in the morning or it's going to mess up my circadian rhythm um others like me i can drink espresso and go to sleep i don't know what it's a weird deal right um i have to and this is what we did is that not normal like espresso and then bed i thought everyone does that it's like a standard right double espresso go to sleep a lot of people that don't do that i don't know what it is cappuccino before bed is like a normal right i begin to see why we like we get on on this show there we go there we are so listen let me let me take this okay yeah i would always say why are you not sleeping because if you're not sleeping because of immense amounts of pain that's one thing if you're not sleeping because of stress that's another thing if you're not sleep because of anxiety it's something else if you're not sleeping because you don't want to sleep because you've got a fear of sleeping that's another thing completely and if you're not sleeping because your bed's uncomfortable that's also something else now it's all about understanding what the reasons are now i don't mean to sound like it sounds rude it's the same conversation i had with russ i was like if you are if you have issues related to anxiety over thought over like over stress there are there there are studies there are there are hundreds of thousands of people who have used cbd for anxiety based reasons i can't tell you that the product will work but i'm saying the chances are it will because everyone seems to use cbd for anxiety seems to get a benefit the issue is is that you've mentioned tumor and because you mentioned tumor it's got me thinking that i don't want you thinking that i can say cbd will be able to cure your tumor do you understand what i mean i don't want to say that okay and and and if you're not sleeping because of something the tumor is doing to your brain i also don't know if cbd will help with that i really don't know i know that it would like for me when i'm anxious cbd helps me sleep i use other ingredients on top of it i'll use terpenes and i'll use like a lavender or a lilanol and i'll use some form of chamomile or something like that in order to give it a bit more of a softness add it to my double expresso sleep like a baby you know what i mean but it's um like i'm saying that's concentration if you want to send me an email man i very happily chat with you and to be honest with you i'll send you a bottle for free just to mess around i'll make you something like i made russ it's it's fun for me and then if it works we know the answer to your question until like you try it and you let me know you're the only one who can really answer your question i can just facilitate that answer in the most affordable way possible do you understand what i mean that's probably the best way of doing it not get you wouldn't get this on any i'm serious and i'm not giving myself a hernia by patting myself on the back but you wouldn't get this sort of level of care on any other radio station you wouldn't you know barry has been really loyal to us and ollie that's a really lovely thing to do that's the easiest way but like i said to you you just said to me you're not hurt look like i'm saying i just gave your dog something for for something he's got i've got no idea if it's going to help him or not but the only way we're ever going to find out if this compound helps that issue is if we try that compound on that issue it's something like a puppy she's dwelling i want to rewind this is very important because i want to discuss it so i don't know i'm going to let chris tell this story okay and i'm going to let him tell him whichever detail he wants but he touched upon this when you were living in colorado you you you you you formulated products for for and you helped people who were who were not well right yes yeah do you want to talk about that i i can absolutely because it's it's it's all about the understanding you know like it's like i said this like like i always ask this question like why do you do what you do you know i ask you what your driving force is but i mean like why do you do what you do i do what i do because i found that cbd really helped me me as a person with my twitches with my tourette's with my general oliverness it i found it really helped me okay and i found that cbd has helped other people and i like understanding how a cbd product can help you with other ingredients which are added to it in order to give you the desired effect i like creating products for the purpose that's why i'm here why are you here do you understand i i think people need to know that yeah very similar and i think when you couple that with the pursuit of science truth knowledge and and you're able to play with plants play with equipment to play with testing and analytics and see that impact in humans and animals your cup stays full as i say right and that's a really nice feeling um so yeah back back in colorado this is in the medical cannabis you know days right when this this whole thing first started i was asked to build a laboratory um to test the amount of cannabinoids in the plants and the extracts in the finished goods and at that time the understanding of these molecules and their chemical and physical properties was abysmal and so you had folks you know fighting the oil and water problem which we still fight today there are oils i want to put them in waters it doesn't mix it sticks to the container it's just a mess right so i got to experience the birth of an industry and the birth of brands and the birth of product types that you've referenced and now do extremely well ollie i mean it's um it had to start in that place with us knowing what was in the product um so this goes on for a few years and i'm able to help a lot of people as as a scientist by saying uh this grower is real this extract is real it's going to be here tomorrow you know what i mean if you find a solution for someone and then it's not a solution tomorrow that's an issue so this is a theme right sustainability sustainability um so years on i meet a group of growers um a group of brothers um the brothers stanley who brought in a bunch of cannabis strains some of which tested very high in cbd and very low in thc and around this same time a couple weeks prior i had met um a very young girl named charlotte who is the um the poster child for cbd she was the girl who started it all she was like the the first media campaign who brought cbd as a as a as an anti-epileptic compound you know that she was like she is the the the educational platform which a lot of our world has been built on you know kids like to kids like tanin's daughter it wouldn't surprise me if tanin only knows about this because of charlotte you know like it's it's sorry sorry for interrupting that that's that that's right i mean her story sparked the demand and the curiosity um canada's helped me you know um so long story short i i spent a considerable amount of time with her and her parents one afternoon discussing cbd and whether it was an option um where they could find it how they could test it was it going to be psychoactive or toxic or interfere with the other drugs she was on and the answer is very similar to the previous answer with with the sleeplessness there's only one way to find out so let's help you find out so i you know having tested the the brother strains and worked them through the process of how to extract and how to refine and test the extracts and normalize everything um i made her first thankful um and a few weeks later we started to see results and a few weeks after that the message started to grow and months after that i was on a podcast just like this talking about it with the brothers and and then cnn publicizes it and there's now tens of thousands of people on a waiting list trying to get access to this product dr sanjay gupta did that like that special i think it's got something like 63 million views on youtube or something and saying like that you know most people who aren't who most people who know anything about cbd know about the story of charlotte and charlotte's web you know it's like that story it's it's it's chris did the formulation this dude's the man like he's the absolute man do you understand like it's hence my emotion at the start this like you can't think of this dude you can't be in this industry and not think of mr dude right here and and not get a little bit emotional yeah i mean it's incredible great and it's and yeah i cannot take you know again it's a team effort again there was an unmet need again you know it's it's i was at ground zero and did so much of this testing work to call bs and say what's real and help people find their solutions and iterating on this same thing over and over again and then saying you know what let's take this outside let's go big um that will there will never be another waiting list again you know that was the inspiration and i don't know brothers it's it's been a very humbling experience and the you know every business has its challenges every individual has their challenges um i mean you all you've talked about regulatory that's extremely challenging but we've now seen acceptance of this product of this molecule and all its other friend friendly molecules um just grow and grow over time and it's it's uh it's it's very humbling work and we call it stewardship we have to be good stewards of this work um because all all eyes are on us right there are people that want us to fail uh from for a number of reasons i mean we've had our own business struggle most people who are your competitors what you like your colleagues want you to fail let alone your like the people outside the industry i mean it's one of the hardest industries to circumnavigate i mean you've got you've got cutthroats and villains within you've got cut fruits and villains on the outside you've got the law you've got when you're when you're afraid of the law you're afraid of your competitors i mean look i've been in the industry for five years now five six years okay five years properly you know and over the last five years the amount of different law changes which i have just seen happen so i mean there was a three-year period between 2018 and 2021 where isolate was banned in foods it wasn't but that was like the law in the uk if you if you're caught using isolating food you know your brain's gonna get shut down it wasn't a law but that was one of the laws during and now they've come out and actually if you're using a full spectrum the chances are it contains thc the chance or it's illegal it's actually you know to be honest with you i don't think you're going to be able to get through novel food with that so all the laws have now then spun on its head and now imagine what that does for business you create a product people get used to it then you have to change it out of fear that you're actually doing something wrong and your clients are breaking the laws then you change it you go through that whole process of hey guys i had to change the product for your protection for my protection blah blah blah they don't like the product you lose all your clients you get a whole bunch of new clients okay and then what happens is you found out you never had to change in the first place but that was just that's the these are the laws that get thrown at you you know that's a really interesting point i i think because we had this debate years ago at gen canada was it full spec was it isolate does the entourage effect which is the combination of multiple cannabinoids and terpenes working together you know is that better than isolate in my case was guess what we can do both and we can do it in a bunch of different formats because guess what everything has its purpose exactly and there are people in this world that can't have any thc in their bloodstream and there are people that can swim in it so let's build a you like that one rust yeah send me a swimming pool show me this one i'll dive heads mostly it's so we thought build a foundation you know build a platform what we call a ginkana production platform to be flexible to be predictable to be able to change as laws change and now with our interaction with with our friends across the pond you know there's there's different levels what we call you know thc free or broad spectrum here you guys have a very it's a hard number and they're trying to launch point naught two but now it's going down to one milligram a container now one milligram of container they're not specified container it's like if someone asks you for a bucket of cake you're like sorry what's the bucket of cake like how do you how do you contemplate a figure of an uh how can you contemplate a a weight or a measure without being given a weight or a measure so it's like saying how much how much does how much does a bucket of bricks weigh so sorry what you know like apparently i found out something new last week cbd as an edible is fully illegal in europe apparently i've already found out from some people and apparently illegal has to be synthesized i heard it from one person but apparently it's facts and he showed me a document which looked pretty real so now i'm sitting there like oh my god like a whole bunch of there go the laws you know like chris i'd like i'd like to ask a couple of questions if i may we're firmly wearing my punters hat as we say number one um you've alluded to your company and everything like this i know ollie's clearly in awe of it which sounds great because if he is impressed i'm impressed how many how many people have you got i mean how many people are involved in the organization uh we're around 50 at the moment um that's good as about six times that and which just speaks to the volatility of the industry it's extremely unpredictable we all have risk i've lost my ass a couple times um but here i mean there's there's nothing better than being able to passionately do what you want to do there are days when i sit down at the end of the day with a very tall glass of bourbon and say and there are other days where i'm just like oh this was great so uh this is called life right russ it's yeah it is it is by the way i've got to come back to the bourbon thing i was at a meeting which was a sort of social thing i'm sitting next to this guy and he's coming from america it was mr beam as in jim beamy was the last of the he was the last lady one of the last in the family was a charming guy yeah charming guy did he speak another beautiful southern accent he was he was delightful um and and and like yourself chris incredibly from those albums done all this and just incredibly modest and you know low-key about americans are the best when you find the good americans i mean they're just awesome you know like the sets i can agree my daughter is american so there we go now um another question i've got for you one of the things which has stunned me and it's been my education that ollie has taken me through metaphorically holding my hand and i just want to ask you this chris i have been amazed that when you've got especially children babies little kids and then we had someone who was 81 and clearly the cbd is improving their quality of life there's no ifs or buts it is okay and yet there's this huge resistance to letting them just you know they're not selling it right also called philip philip was using a a full a full cannabis okay so cbd is fully legal but but the the epileptic kids that they're using a a majority cbd blend i mean it has negligible amounts of thc in it and they are still you know the hoops they've got to jump through to get that cbd product at the same time i just want to thought i'd correct you but carry on russell you're quite no you're quite right and thank you for that because we do want to be legal about it but my question to you is this chris um in um in america is there still this sort of pushback from no no you've got to have you know big pharma you've got to have the pharmaceuticals we don't we don't recognize this as being helpful so it changes every day and it's changed greatly over time and i've i frankly have been flabbergasted i myself have testified you know in in state senates and houses and rule making committees where you know the law is about to change there's a proposal in front to regulate the industry and this particular example is in medical cannabis but i it floored me russ because you have the chief of police association there to lobby against the bill and i'm there to say look we can practically figure this out together and by the way you guys already decriminalized the possession of an ounce or less so running a red light is more egregious than having an ounce of weed and now you're gonna you're gonna tell us that we can't you know meaningfully produce something after the hearing the head of the chief of police association comes up and says so my dad's pretty sick and i'm wondering you can get me stuff this is what we're here to discuss man so times are a changing and the fda here um has not made up their mind quite yet on what the definitions should be but they are actively regulating the industry our state department of health and our state regulators have been extremely excited about yet responsible with how they regulate us and the fda i think is is is looking to um novel foods as a very interesting way of doing this right their concerns are about safety of the products and my argument to this is look if we can demonstrate some safety and we can demonstrate that and produce these products in accordance with what we call good manufacturing practices which exist for foods another set exists for supplements and another set even more stringent exists for pharmaceutical production so if we know how the product is grown and produced and it's very well documented and controlled then you've got the answer right you can say it's safe safely produced and uh resoundingly similar batch to batch a lot to lot you have mechanisms to recall a product if you had to what i'm saying is we normalize this just like everything else people take vitamin c supplement what's the big deal you know this should be no different and so we have invested very heavily in toxicology work and stability work to show that these products are safe and that there's no arsenic or lead or residual solvents or microbiology concerns with the ingredient that ollie might use to formulate and with the finished goods that ollie formulates as an example we have to tap we spend more damn money on testing than you would believe do you spend more money the amount of money we spent on tesla on testing we could have bought a tesla okay and when you figure that out you're like oh my god should have just not tested anything rolling around in a tesla i would have been happier okay this is the way of the world you have to ease those concerns and so what we we have uh become brcgs accredited which you all might recognize more than a lot of our folks here but it dictates a logical risk-based approach to your internal standards and every year an auditor shows up there's one due here just in a couple of weeks and they give you the ringer for two three days if there's an issue they're gonna find it and they'll take your accreditation but the purpose of those independent third party accreditations for us is to say look we can do this and we can change minds there's always going to be sentiment against it just like there was with prohibition of alcohol right people have their strange notions religious spiritual political otherwise bad personal experiences uh but when the evidence really builds and builds and builds time's gonna change if you actually thought about it i mean so like as someone who's watched the cbd industry you know grow in the uk and to be honest with you i like having my brother in america i watched the the cannabis industry over the last 10 years grow as well and as someone like you who's watched the cannabis industry grow over the last 20 years i mean i kind of like the fact that these protocols are being brought in it's like it makes me think that one day you will be able to walk into a walmart at tesco and asda all right tesco azure is our equivalent of walmart walk up to the pharmaceutical section you know where they've got your ibuprofen and your paracetamol just sitting there on the shelf and you'll have your ibuprofen paracetamol cbd you know that's precisely how this is kind of video we we um the api idea this is what you were saying and that like it's the right way you know like who wants a bathroom formulated product you know who wants something that's made in a kitchen with doggies running around i mean like who wants that you know like like it's it's insane but that's what the market's been built on but i like this idea of you know grass-rooted people stepping up a notch because we can there's no reason we can't you know if everyone else can there's like we can also bring bring that quality you know so that's that's essentially what we've seen manifest itself as ingredient suppliers as formulators as um someone that we contract manufacturers as well like we we can't do it all there are pros that make say a soft gel capsule as an example why build a facility just to do that when there are pros it was about convincing them that our ingredient was legal compliant well characterized and able to be brought into their facility so that they could make the soft gel that could then be in the grocery store pharmacy over the counter same is true for those retailers and for those brands they show up and do a vendor approval on it and give us the business for two or three days and tour the site and go through all of our documents to say you know what this is real backwards and forwards and the risk associated with this ingredient or this product is low enough for us to incorporate it into our finished goods and thereby increase access to quality cannabinoids that's my mission in life increasing access to quality cannabinoids and without building the foundation you you can't do that so you're doing well man so all i say is you're doing well like i've seen your footprint and fact the matter is is there's this consistency which i'm going to go on to again it all starts with this consistency in order to end up with that final product coming out of the capsule maker which is perfect and every capsule is exactly 25 milligrams and you've given them an sop to follow the math you've given them an extract to go with that sop if that extract isn't what you say it is then no matter how much you follow the math you're never going to come up with the right product and it's it's so it's all about the starting foundation of the extracts we use and you know like being able to dream big and think you know one day i'm going to be able to walk into any shop and there will just be cbd on the shelf as a standard not some 75 pound 1 000 milligram which you know is extortionately priced you know you know you know it's insane you know that it's market manipulation and corruption like a standard product which anyone can use i mean like like you need to have this this standardization this compliance is consistency this this reputation for being reliable in order for the companies to even humor the idea you know yeah and that's you touched on something that i still i still struggle with because i i i see these product launch press releases and i see the retailers and the online sales promotions and i don't understand if you're in need how you can afford some of the products out there and that's precisely the problem goals obviously is to make that change because i just it's all for not if you can't actually buy it right so i think we work as an industry to make that more affordable more accessible um it's going to happen naturally anyway but i everything happens with climate change our ceo's going to kill me the more it's accepted the more it's accepted by the general population the more you can produce you know the cheaper the price will come down the more you know a lot of money is spent almost educating and you know almost fighting this resistance you know like 30 quid in every tincture is probably spent convincing people that they need that tincture as soon as people don't need the convincing anymore the prices will come crashing down it's like if you had to tell someone they needed an ibuprofen every time they needed they had a headache ibuprofen would be 16 17 pounds a packet if that much marketing had to go in behind it if that much education had to go behind it so like i don't want to say the the the the users are making it difficult but if there were more users taking this on who were educating other users so brands didn't have to market then they wouldn't have the excuse for why the price was so high because that's always the excuse for every product being expensive on the marketplace oh it's branding because branding costs money you know like marketing costs money that's the o cost money part of my thought on this too is how many how many times is the ingredient brokered intestine oh so many times buried costs are there in oh oh it is what you say it is okay well i'm going to test it on it crosses 16 hands before it gets to someone like you or someone like us who formulates it it's it's crazy but it is normalizing russ i mean to your question it is getting more and more normal by the day you just have to i mean the more we are able to directly interact with regulators directly interact with producers and consumers you you just start to thread it all together so this is a new common understanding of what we're doing and that's what we seek to do is educate well i want i want you to know the effect you're having on our uh our listeners and people viewing uh ed grossman russ this is a very seriously great show one of the things chris and and you are an awesome absolute exemplar of this is that i had no idea the sort of folk that ollie mammon was going to bring onto the show i mean i was full of trepidation it's not an area i know anything about so as i said 22 weeks has been a rocket ride for me everyone who comes on is so erudite is so articulate is so passionate it's so genuine and and it comes from and i know this sounds ridiculous but it comes from a good place it's not about just making money it's coming from a good place and that's what's so that's what's so fantastic it really is you know great i really appreciate that um i mean i i think i spoke with ollie for all of 2.7 minutes before i was like this is a brother you know like these people so easily and there are potholes as we we would say out there there are people that are opportunistic and taking advantage of every angle but what we say as as industry stewards um will be here at the end of every day that's a beautiful way to leave this show chris dubs all the way from kentucky i'm so excited thank you so much for joining us i love that beautiful bro always as always it's a pleasure until next week bye everybody bye guys thanks chris", "JjTiqvrpnFA": "what you think that this the oil the would have a positive effect on these chil I and I definitely believe it would yes because it's any seizure you know anything like this so I mean I'm never treated in anyone with this condition but I would definitely if this was my child I definitely put this child on the oil try it I mean the main thing here is you're not giving the child something that can harm it no no's arm factor yeah no danger so but I think we have good results with this I really do I think there's hope here that's an awful thing I mean you have to live like that my god that's not a life at all no this gives a child a chance and this is the same way to see with these autistic children you know yeah yeah it just does amazing maturity I trust each other their autistic - yeah most of them yeah well I think that doing your would probably well I believe if it can't cure it is probably gonna be best control you're gonna find and like I said it's harmless so I would definitely try it that's what we're we have been aiming for we've been trying to get this oil here in Iceland legally right for a year now hmm the doctors are working against us Corsair yeah but so now we're coming to a point where we have to say okay are we going to continue on this path and and do this for the next ten years or are we gonna get the oil somewhere else if you thought about taking the channel to the US yeah I've thought about that yeah but I mean illegally and in the system there it's not gonna be eligible but well the problem - I mean the oils available and me dispensaries and things in the US now but but the quality to see that there's no quality control there's no standards in place yet you know we need the freedom to do this simple research in no time we can you know bring this a little too much better levels but I would I definitely would if this is my child I would definitely try that and I think and you know I mean I can't make guarantees but I think you're gonna have good results with this oh yeah yeah I've seen well I mean any like epilepsy or any of these other diseases that you know that it's very similar because you're into seizures yeah and it's great anti-seizure medication even you all's that I produce you know like Sanjay Gupta did that piece on CNN you know and it showed the epileptic children and it was reducing it reduced the number of seizures no question but it didn't stop them they still had seizures here and there even when they were taking off but as soon as I watched that I said if there was some THC and more can't seeing that oh I bet you the seizures would cease completely okay so he's very important yeah that's that's another question I had for you because many people are supporting the use of CBD or an or THC free oil yeah well that's a stupid I mean it's it is it's a synergetic effect of all those well over a hundred different cannabinoids working together that creates these effects these healing effects so the two eleven eight th seeds mean that's stupid I'm just plain stupid so you would recommend a THC high I tried I would try something like a 50-50 yeah CBD THC about the same strength and just small tiny doses we're child up over a few days but I'd be willing to bet that it would have quite a dramatic effect on a child like this okay yeah but norm so the dosage what what would you do a drop or no not even a drop when you're starting and even when I start an adult off in this oil it's really I tell people to start with it's just like a little tiny speck like 1/4 of a drop not much bigger than that okay nothing you know and then over every eight hours and then after four days try to double the dose because that gives us the body time to adjust to it this is a very strong if you got the clear oil it's a very strong medication but again no her almost could have caused the child do is sleep so just keep just doubling the doses every four days and then just watch the child and see what happens and I'm willing to bet after you start doubling dose a couple times I think you'd start seeing some pretty dramatic results I would definitely do this and so you would continue this throughout well not necessarily because I mean the oil might be able to correct the illness you know I think it's a good idea that every child well everybody should be taking you all to protect themselves anyway but you know in case like this if we can bring that loss like y'all to autistic children once you get their body detoxify get these toxins gone they're no longer autistic well they don't have to keep taking you if they don't want it but I really believe in the near future I mean everything I'm seeing now the whole future of medicine is going to be in cannabinoids and you know I so I think it's a good idea to continue taking it but I would you know even if you just got a small quantity of oil like 2 3 grams or four grams not very much just because you know it's gonna take quite a while you're only giving us a tiny little doses like that it takes quite a while you use that much oil up yeah but just keep doing and I can't imagine it not I can't imagine it not helping and everything I firmly believe it would help yeah I think it gives you the best and safest option possible look I'm all I can do for your brother yeah thank you completed yeah I presented a message do some research look into it look what's going on in the internet go on YouTube look at all these children and everything people that are using this now this is no damn joke you'll get this marijuana nonsense out of your head says this this is a medicine and it's a wonderful medicine and it's safe non-addictive what else is are out there like this well PubMed they have hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies and all types of different things you know they're like well even now they're coming up with evidence now and I knew this years ago because we were treating schizophrenia experice that very effectively now they're admitting finally it's a very attractive treatment for schizophrenia yes but the thing is it's a safety of it no you're not giving your child something that's going to harm it and there's a good possibility that it could save the child's life and free the parents I mean the same thing with this if you have up to an autistic child or you have a child like this you're going to have to take care of that child for the rest it's like it'll never have a life at least with the oil it offers them an opportunity you know it gives them a chance what have you got to lose", "QayQd3B3Y2I": "[Music] hello guys welcome to CCC I'm Shane I'm Dan and we're back for another strange review this time we're doing a little joint session yep Jeffrey rolled up checking out the vortex from TTA seeds actually it is sativa dominant hybrid it's like 80% sativa or is it Apollo 13 and space Queen yeah space queen is a city 99 cross I believe it's crossed with Romulan yeah there's something wrong in there's a bunch of bomb flavors going in this I've always thought the kind of a dominant thing or the most similar one in my opinions of this strain of what you know its parents was the Cindy yeah I really like Cindy 99 as far as you know just a strain goes yeah and good vortex always kind of reminds me of Cindy yeah I believe this is the first time we've had the vortex on the show though yeah I think so yeah we had some Vortech hash maybe one time oh yeah this is a first time we know stringer view of it yeah but as far as the nerves go they're pretty they're pretty you know they'd look good they're frosty we don't have on the table you know just roll that joint over there and left them over there we'll be right now so we're back we just got the flower here retreat the only thing that we needed for this video but yeah it smells good definitely what you're saying the space clean is what comes through on the smell and most me and that almost smells like like a candy Jack or like Jack the Ripper from TJ yeah yeah it definitely has a kind of definitely a jackie essence mmm I should mention this stuff came from chai same quest we got the cat piss from that we did the last week yeah it says indoor vortex on the sticker looking at the notes there's some perk going on here there's a little bit of color on them which I've seen with a view of or tech samples and I think it's pretty normal for the strain we're down with the perk though you know it's all good here we got a lot of tiny little popcorn knives which one thing I guess that that club usually has good weed but a lot of times you get kind of little baby no popcorn notes it's taste really good actually out of the joint we actually don't have a bond here now with we lost our 11 millimeter slide that we use on the II Ross we're trying to find a way to get one back they're hard to find I mean I was telling the other day it's damn near impossible yeah I know 8k is making them I'm just trying to get a clear stock slide for you know clear balm you know I could probably to be Ross you get another one cuz he's the one who made the tube that tastes really good out of the trunk go surprise we just we books good like he said the popcorn mugs I'm not really digging not very camera friendly although it is still really frosty I don't know the flavor was decent I'm just trying to think if I had to rate this probably gotta rip it a couple more times starting to come in behind the eyes like a like a good sativa usually does yeah it smells pretty good too but like it's so similar some candy I mean I grew some Jack the Ripper last year it's really similar in the smell you know I'm saying remember that Jack Berger last year yeah I'm trying it's coming listen all's got a couple of layers in it it's really it's got that really sweet but also it's like a sweet like a candy Jack plus the other Jack flavor that's kind of uh how would you describe a nineteen I don't know yeah it's more of a spicy Jack yeah it's got it definitely has a nice nose on it this definitely this smell has a lot of layers to it yeah kind of take a kind of you know captivates you for a second when you smell it because it's it's it's hard to completely put your finger on but it's definitely good as far as as far as the look of the bud hard to get a good you know like a good opinion on the budget cuz we got nothing but popcorn you know but yeah it's always gonna say the bigger no because that's what I picked up you know this is large one it looks pretty good it's got a good amount of horn chairs not super you know caked up not super you know frosted yeah well you know it's so a good amount of frost also the fact that the looks like the try kids are really small and this stuff probably you know makes it look a little bit less frosty but as you get on in on the inside of the dogs it's still pretty caked with nice and tagged heads on the outside of the butt though you know it does look a little bit touched up yeah if I had to point out something that if I point out my favorite thing about this made up price it's the smell I'm usually into that kind of Jacky you know Jack's one of my favorite I feel like TGA uses a lot of Jack crosses - yeah so it's probably a strong point I feel like just you know being honest here the most TGA strains I feel like don't they're not gonna knock me on my ass like some some really good og but yeah it's there's a lot of good sativas the flavor with the TGA strains is always usually really nice yeah if I had to rate this weed you know it's got a mild high I'm not straight knocked on my ass like you're saying but I definitely feel clear like I could go out and do something with my day you know we still got half a joint smell oh yeah that's true so we'll see I mean I'm just saying I know what you mean though it's not a lot of times when you're smoking the joint you can feel it in the first couple of hits especially that coming in sober like we are right now yeah there's some not necessarily really feeling yet but it's not really a stony type of no I that's what I say so it's not that thing it's like I feel like I'll go out and do a bunch of activities right now have a productive day you know it's not like some og where you take one hit you're like all right I mean doing [ __ ] with the rest of my day yeah it's definitely traditionally this is one of those strains that's like a good wake and bake strain for me you know smoke it in the morning gets you in a real like positive mindset is he going you know gets you active yeah it's it's got to this smell is kind of crazy I'm almost getting like a little mango thing going on yes it's got some discussing layers for sure like you're saying must be like that other stuff you know or I guess I'm kind of like a lot of the strains we've been reviewing lately I get a slightly different snow off some of the different notes you know yes not something that I usually I mean you know this person could have grew from seed and decided not to mother out you know I'd better just screw in a bunch of different seeds and therefore you probably got some different phenotypes you know yeah yeah crazy smooth that's definitely my favorite thing the flavors it's a little mild but it's good you know like jackie joyner yeah the the flavor is on the mild side that it definitely tastes good but the smell the smell is crazy we're gonna go ahead and rate this stuff I'd say as far as looks probably gonna give this one like six and a half I was gonna say seven yeah it's I think it's a little more frosty than you give it credit for with I think I think this was probably like an eight or a nine month ago yeah when it was untouched you know right I want to see the bigger notes - yes take it out I'm it's mainly losing points for me because it's it's you know really small dogs and it looks like it's kind of been beat up in a turkey bag or whatever but still when you get in on the inside of the nugs really stinky really frosty really nice yeah yeah as far as smell goes this one's gonna get a man like a nine or ten of drugs bars all goes yeah it was pretty awesome yeah I like the smells like that that have a lot of layers to them you know take awhile to figure out the high I would give probably eight because you know it could be a little stronger but like I said sometimes I'm looking for this kind of weak that just go out and do stuff I'm kind of feeling a sudden almost like I'm feel super relaxed in the shoulders yeah kind of clear mind alert you know which is kind of looked like I said what were used to with this train really nice awake and big yes so overall I thought I probably brings us an honest eight eight out of ten with the bear thing yeah I mean I probably could have got a little bit better if I seen you know the head nods I'm sure they're a lot prettier yeah I'd say I'd say that a month ago this weed was probably a nine one nine or nine point five out of ten but I'm gonna go go with his rating of an eight yeah I think that's that's pretty fair it's for me it's definitely some good weed it's really it's you know it's true to what we're looking for with this strain and as far as the buzz and the way it looks you know so good stuff thank you guys for joining us again for another interview let's kind of smoky in there we have a class in front of us that I can barely see through the camera I guess that means you had a good session thanks for joining us CCC I'm Shane I'm dead [Music]", "RGoeJfCsZsA": "we're fixing corporation August 9 2018 we have a CP for screw pressing we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "WahCXfOE7Ew": "okay so i have here i have my little showroom yeah so for example this this mirror this is chives uh-huh and this here is the fiber so if you look at the plant uh you have the stem then the the chives is or the the fiber is the outer core and the chives the wooden part is the inside it's the one that has uh the cellulose and the lingnin so it's an amazing plant to work with in if we look at the applications especially non-woven applications in inspires me", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of

farming industrial hemp podcast my name is eric herlock and today march 17th st patrick's day we're going to take a trip to ireland and hear about the hemp industry there but it's not all leprechauns and rainbows as you might expect chris allen tells us how the government is making things very difficult for the industry and for farmers and how the government is trying to hand off the industry to the pharmaceutical companies plus we'll hear from jonathan miller at the u.s hemp round table about why marketing delta 8 thc as a hemp product is bad for the hemp industry but first a few nuggets of hemp news right after this message from our sponsor ind hemp ind hemp is currently seeking summer interns for an exciting opportunity in montana this year are you or someone you know a college student majoring in agricultural economics mechanical engineering or agronomy well this is a great opportunity to learn about the fiber and grain side of hemp and then take that knowledge home with you to help build the hemp industry in your community ind hemp is committed to a diverse and inclusive working environment and encourages anyone with an interest in hemp fiber and grain to apply go to indhemp.com to learn more all right some nuggets of hemp news this week all right here's one from hemp today headline reads specialized harvester hopes to tap growing interest in fiber the story says that a canadian company is bringing specialized fiber hemp harvesting technology to north america anticipating continued expansion of applications for the hemp plant stalk and expanding hemp fields worldwide british columbia based for evergreen which is providing specialist farming equipment maker lamitris from lithuania providing them with global sales support and is now taking orders for the kp-4 fiber hemp cutter the harvester can mow down hemp fields at up to 12 miles per hour taking a swath of nine feet here's a story from australia this is in hemp gazette headline reads do hemp farms stink it's written by stephen gothrinet some residents living close to a trial hemp crop in red cliffs victoria are reporting headaches resulting from the smell but others say the smell doesn't concern them i hemp victoria is the officially recognized trade association for industrial hemp in the state the organization's president darren christie said he had never heard of these sorts of complaints and trial crops have been grown around victoria for the last 15 years but mr christie notes some varieties can have a strong odor while others don't sometimes unpleasant smells and agriculture go hand in hand for some people the smell of cow manure doesn't bother them for others it's a special sort of torture and it's probably the same for hemp the smell can be particularly strong when the plant is flowering so it should be a temporary issue but that's easy to say when not impacted by the odor the folks affected at red cliffs seem supportive of hemp per se they just want it growing somewhere else away from houses there doesn't seem to be any particularly bad feeling between the parties at this stage and that's great but a solution is needed before that changes as hemp becomes more commonplace in australia as it has done in the usa issues such as odor will need some serious attention on a related note five tribal fiber crops are being grown in the state this year according to ihem victoria i hem victoria says that new and experienced farmers have made the decision to all use the same seed variety to maximize their success as the particular variety is very stable from east to west and from north to south each crop was robust and consistent oh australia okay from australia to africa here is a story from malawi this is in the nuyasa times and it's written by philip pasula the story says some individual hemp growers in mazimba are threatening the government with legal action for failure to issue them with licenses the prospective cannabis farmers claim that they have invested 30 million koacha in the industrial hemp farming umbelwa investment limited spokesperson reverend william mumba said saturday in mezuzah that delays to issue licenses are frustrating he said the government should issue them with the licenses he says we are extremely concerned as farmers because we have invested a lot into this venture we had all the trust in our government that they would fulfill what was promised because it is about the country's economy it's very unfortunate the government does not seem to be concerned and this is where we think we might consider mobilizing ourselves to force government to refund the money if government issued the licenses farmers from mozimba alone would bring into the country approximately two billion dollars this would certainly help to boost the economy of the country explain mumba another concerned farmer martin cumwenda wondered why an initiative conceived by government itself was also being hindered by the same government all right well i hope this works out for you all in malawi i just can't imagine you know a government getting in in the way of progress uh oh speaking of which here's a story from hempgrower.com headline reads dea calls out hemp in latest drug threat assessment report the agency claims hemp is being used as a cover-up for illicit cannabis operations this is written by teresa bennett and it says that in its annual national drug threat assessment report the u.s drug enforcement administration the dea calls out hemp production as a way for drug trafficking organizations to cover up illicit cannabis operations the hemp industry has long criticized the dea's involvement in hemp affairs especially since the production of the crop was legalized on a federal level in 2018 removing the dea from the picture has been an ongoing battle as the agency has fought to remain a part of hemp regulation the final rule on hemp which takes effect march 22nd still requires hemp testing at a dea registered lab however the regulation has been delayed until december 2022 until then the industry will likely continue to push to remove dea influence from the industry we really want to get the dea out of the business of regulating him says jonathan miller general counsel for us hemp roundtable and he just so happens to be on our show today talking about delta athc stay tuned for that okay here's a story from arizona this is in hemp industry daily headline reads arizona hemp farmers see crop losses from pithium in drip irrigated fields the story says that farmers in arizona found out the hard way the drip irrigation may not be the way to go for growing hemp crops in the state's arid climate during the 2020 growing season 85 percent of drip irrigated hemp plants in yuma and graham counties showed symptoms of crown and root rot a disease that leads to leaf yellowing and browning sudden wilting and plant death agronomists at the university of arizona said the pathogen causing crop losses was pythium afenidermatum commonly known as water mold which thrives in damp environments and can infect hemp at any growth stage crown and root rot on hemp is often found in heavy soils with poor drainage particularly in hot climates using plastic mulch and excessive irrigation according to the agronomist study infection can be minimized by ensuring crops are grown in soils with good drainage regulating irrigation to prevent oversaturation and removing mulch to reduce soil moisture the u.s environmental protection agency has not yet approved fungicides to help farmers manage pythium on hemp all right and one more this one is about a listening session a webinar called what's next for industrial hemp it's hosted by pasa sustainable agriculture and you know what let's just call up hannah smith brubacher from pasa and find out more hannah smith brubacher executive director at pasa sustainable agriculture welcome to the lancaster farming industrial hemp podcast how are you doing today i'm great eric i'm happy to be joining you today yeah i'm glad you're here so your organization pasa sustainable agriculture has a hemp event next friday march 26th it's a webinar it's a listening session called what's next for industrial hemp it's 12 pm to 1 pm friday the 26th it's a free event and can you tell us some more about it sure well i think similar to most of our listening sessions when we detect that in the community there might be a little bit of oh disconnect between state regulation or or or um kind of rules of the game and where the community is sitting in terms of wanting to be creative and and or you know really using kind of the organic development of a new field to guide where farmers can go um and hemp is certainly one of those areas where a lot of the state regulations just haven't caught up to end federal regulations probably more so federal regulations haven't really caught up to sort of the market potential for a product and so we're going to have this listening session um we'll have josh leidecker from the susquehanna hemp company andrea ferrick from ironwood forestry sarah mitchell from kings agri-seeds and phil stober from department of agriculture really come on and just listen to what people have to say we'll talk about um how the federal hemp rule is impacting local growers um hopefully talk about grant programs that are available through the state um or having pda on the call and really just sort of what's in the works in terms policy investment um get some conversation going around it so that people can maybe be a little closer to being on the same page oh good okay and people can register for it at pasafarming.org yes that's correct okay and i'll put a link to that on the show page for this episode um and so maybe folks who are listening don't know what pasa is can you tell us what pasa is sure sure so pasta sustainable agriculture is a non-profit organization serving farmers and ag professionals and supporters all engaged in this arena called sustainable agriculture and so we welcome everyone to that conversation and um our our we have 7 500 members that have a net worth of about 60 000 across the mid-atlantic and northeast all working together to support farmers that really want to farm in a way that is ecologically sound that's good all right well hannah i appreciate what you are doing and what pasa is doing and i thank you for your time today thank you eric all right i will have links to all of those stories including that webinar on the show page for this episode at lancasterfarming.com okay there's been a lot of talk lately in the industry and even on this podcast about delta 8 thc and what that means for the industry the usm brown table last week issued a statement concerning the marketing of these products so today we're checking in with jonathan miller head counsel for the usm brown table jonathan miller general counsel to the u.s hemp round table welcome back to our show how are you doing i'm great good to be with you so last week the u.s hemp round table released a statement concerning the marketing of hemp products and the statement read in part the u.s hemp roundtable is opposed to marketing products under the guise of the hemp name for any intoxicating value or euphoric effect calling it an irresponsible practice so i assume that you're referring in part at least to the recent development and marketing of delta 8 thc products so what's at issue here and why is it irresponsible sure so it uh it's uh delta eight is is the the hot topic right now but uh we're on the understanding that there are many other potential products that are being developed and we wanted to be clear there's a bright line here that on one side of the line are non-intoxicating have products that can be sold as dietary supplements and can be used by folks for their general health and wellness and then intoxicating products um which are marijuana adult use cannabis other other types of of those products that are subject to a different regulatory regime whether it's sold through dispensaries but otherwise limited to adults who are either wanting to get high or using it for some other um intoxicating benefit so we're not calling for a ban of d8 or a ban of intoxicating products in fact uh you know there are several dozen states where it's legal to to sell and purchase intoxicating products it's just that they shouldn't be called hemp and there should be a different regulatory regime for each so if hemp were to get you high now that's sort of a problem for the overall hemp brand because you've done so much work to say this is hemp not marijuana and then now it's sort of blurring those lines so i understand why it's a concern um do you have any like safety concerns with how the compound is created or produced or processed and then applied to hemp yeah absolutely and and uh you know what the challenge is is people are going into vape shops and gas stations and picking up something that says it's hemp and says it'll get you high and there's no regular regulation of this and and there could be health risks there certainly could be risks for intoxicating of miners or or folks that are particularly sensitive to to intoxication so we uh that's why it's important that these products uh uh be regulated in a way that protects consumer health and safety at what point do you expect dea involvement or other regulatory action from the government or if any well the dea has already signaled that they are looking at taking action against synthetically developed products such as delta eight and we're we're wanting to make sure that there's no overreach on the part of the dea they may be well intentioned to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish but conceivably if a regulation or law is written too broadly it could uh it could result in good products that are for the general health and wellness of folks to be uh made unavailable so um we're we're in meetings with the dea we're we're trying to schedule meetings with the fda and and uh this is going to be a big subject for those discussions right now i know you're a lawyer not a chemist but can you explain sort of how this delta 8 works or like how it's you know chemical compounds similar i'm not a chemist either i was an english major how does this work where does it come from what are they doing yeah i'm i'm really i'm not that much of a scientist i mean i'm not a scientist and i just know the basics which are um there is delta 8 thc in every full spectrum product there's a trace amount of of a whole lot of different cannabinoids the only get the only way to to get an intoxicating value uh for delta eight is to use some sort of chemical synthesis or chemical conversion so you take cbd and perform some chemical synthesis or conversion and it creates uh a high level of delta eight and so that is that is where the challenge is and and you know when you get chemicals involved uh it becomes a concern to an industry that's uh focused on on health and safety right so this is happening in a lab not on a farm it's not like you can buy genetics that are like delta eight genetics correct okay um what would you say to hemp farmers who've recently found delta eight as a legal way to sell their otherwise unsold hemp crop uh you know we're we're not we're not proposing it uh be illegal um but uh that uh if you're wanting to use chemical synthesis and create a high intoxicating product that it should be sold through the uh system of uh adult use cannabis uh you know marijuana dispensaries in in the you know 30 plus states that currently have uh those products legal those we just do simply do not agree with selling those kinds of products without regulation at gas stations and vape shops what would you say to farmers who are considering getting into this delta eight side of things i counsel patients i mean we are working on the federal level to try to ease the burdens on on hemp derived products such as cbd or other non-intoxicating extracts so we're we could use your help in getting legislation to uh to pass congress go to hempsupporter.com and we've made it easy for folks to sign up for free and send emails directly to their members of congress to urge them to support hemp derived products but again if you're if you're wanting to get into the intoxicating space um you're going to be very careful right now it's a gray area right now these products are arguably legal um so it might be a money-making opportunity right now but i do know that there is a lot of political pressure to do something about it what's interesting is that the pressure is not just coming from us in the hemp industry who are worried about the damage it does to the hemp brand but the marijuana industry is is opposed as well because they're have they have to go through all the regulations and sell their products and dispensaries they they hate the idea that they're competing products being sold on regulating gas stations so it really is a a subject that unites folks from all sides of the spectrum right um you mentioned a little bit about this in the beginning but um so delta eight isn't the only sort of alternate cannabinoid out there with some intoxicating effects there's an article in the new york times a couple weeks ago that talked about delta eight but then they mentioned delta ten at the end so is this like some kind of thc pandora's box we'll just keep going yeah i'm i'm understanding that delta 10 is right around the corner and there's a delta 16 and delta 32 or other you know we're just going to continue to see this and so we just we need to draw a bright line between intoxicating and non-toxicating products all right there you go jonathan miller from the u.s hemp round table all right so today as i mentioned is st patrick's day maybe it won't be by the time you're listening to this but it is today and i thought it would be great to uh to go to ireland i spent a little bit of time there back in 2004 my honeymoon it's such a beautiful place full of wonderful people so today i thought we'd celebrate st patrick's day by talking about the irish hemp industry my guest today is chris allen the executive director of the hemp federation of ireland welcome to the lancaster farming industrial hemp podcast chris and happy st patrick's day how are you doing thanks so much i'm doing really well and uh it's a pleasure to speak to you in pennsylvania today thank you um so i don't know much about hemp and ireland but i've i've done a little research and where do things stand it seems from what i gather your government isn't fully on board with the crop and they're making it hard for the industry to grow and for farmers to make a living at growing hemp and your organization is calling on uh t-shock michael martin to address the issue so what is the issue what needs to change what should the government be doing that they're not doing now well ireland has a very old hemp industry we have one of the oldest hemp industries in europe with a complete supply chain and so we have farmers and processors and retailers here um stretching back to the 1970s but a complete supply chain from the early 90s and so that industry just as a niche industry just plodded along very happily um until 2018 when suddenly the irish government started to exercise misuse of drugs laws in relation to the agricultural crop and so then we have um you know very much kind of very visible kind of targeting retailers and uh then you have in ireland a very um drugs orientated uh discourse in the media around him and so going on from that then we have just um had the industry is pretty much disabled entirely in ireland um so for example in april of of 2020 the state enterprise agency adopted policy whereby the only people who could access state enterprise support for any activities related to him so not just the food but the fiber the seed all of our entire industry the only people who could access state support in relation to that was pharmaceutical companies and so that's that's where it's at at the moment in ireland and uh but happily we do have the european court of justice ruling from um november of 2020 and then also the the european commission's position on the uh world health organization vote at the u.n then in december so we're currently in ireland in a very unique position in europe because ireland is the only country in europe that hasn't um taken account of the court of justice ruling or indeed the european commission subsequent statement that hemp is a food and is regulated under european food law so uh it's a very bizarre and strange situation in ireland and probably best understood in relation to the the huge huge cohort of pharmaceutical companies operating in ireland so um i i wrote an article for for health europa at the end last year and i provided them a graph which shows that the pharmaceutical sector in ireland is actually responsible for over 80 percent of all of our combined total exports so that's a very powerful uh industrial lobby in ireland sure but why would the pharmaceutical industry have any interest in let's say fiber hemp you know for hemp create or for you know the grain for food or like i i don't like it's a disconnect to me why it's just about money huh it's about money i mean essentially it's about controlling the cbd and cannabinoid industry um and so while while the industry was was entirely disabled um you know during the the kind of late spring early summer of last year and we also had a bizarre situation where the central bank of ireland licensed uh an irish domiciled investment fund to to go about raising 150 million for investment in companies in the pharmaceutical and wellness sectors including him so you know it's it's really i think very much a question of having the stopping the growth of the the national industry so our own domestic sector and then hand in hand with that the irish government is now um proposing that we will have a fiber only development of the hemp industry in ireland um so i'm sure you're aware the land mass of the island of ireland is tiny absolutely tiny and we also have then um an extraordinary number of cattle and dairy cows and ruminant animals so we have currently we've got the climate change advisory council which is our our government's expert advisors on the environment and on climate action and they're currently reprimanding our government since 2018 about draining our peat bogs so as to grow butter so as to feed the number of cattle that we currently have in the island and agriculture is responsible for more than a third of our combined total co2 emissions in ireland and where the irish government believes that they're going to find the land on the island to to support a fiber um hemp industry is is just beyond ludicrous so really it's just a way of finally killing off the industry i think and then we have concurrently with that in ireland we had in at the end of the summer the first pharmaceutical [Music] synthetic cbd food supplement launched on our market um and so that's one of two companies in europe who have a synthetic lab-grown cbd which of course doesn't involve the plant at all um on the market oh these are some sad things i'm hearing from ireland yeah i am i had no idea that the predicament was so dire there yeah it's very bad huh and so what's the path forward well i mean we have a very um you know old as i said but also ethically um you know conscious uh grassroots industry in ireland and i believe that there are other such um you know hemp actors all around the planet everywhere in all of the countries and since um you know i started to or we as an organization started to you know very um forthrightly challenge what's happening here i've been contacted by people all over the world who are experiencing very similar i mean maybe not quite so um easy to to see as it is in ireland but but very similar kind of constructs around trying to to stop the growth of the hemp industry from that grass roots level and send it off in another direction that's much more corporate facing and far less environmentally aware yeah from my research i find that the cannabis plant like thrives in community so i would sort of venture to guess that they're not going to be successful in holding back that grassroots effort to bring this industry up yeah i mean i hope so um in 2018 when i when i came into this space in the first place it was i was commissioned to do a piece of research for a company to submit to the irish eraktus which is our parliament and so in that piece of research what i did was i i outlined what the economic potentials of the industry were which is probably a mistake but um what i also outlined was the way in which the industry needs to be developed and as a fully integrated um industry you know taking account of all of its potentials and not privileging economic potentials over the other social and co-benefit potentials of the industry and also that it needed to be integrated at local level um you know and it needed to be a community-based approach to the development of the sector and especially for for irish farming um you know irish farming is is in deep trouble because of the the you know amount of uh agrochemicals and um various other um practices associated with the huge amount of remnant animal farming that there is here and you know hemp as well you know if the farmers have access to the full use potentials of their crops you know it's a viable living for farmers and it's um you know a lifeline for rural communities as well and like in america here in ireland and throughout europe you know there's huge succession issues in farming and really the kind of demise of small farming um is on the cards whereas hemp is very exciting for for younger farmers and they're really interested in coming into it and they're interested in the agroecological benefits um you know it's just it's just such a wonderful industry and it's just um really sad to see governments not understanding that that you know there's a new way of doing things perhaps a better way um you know and it maybe doesn't involve you know corporate facing policies across the board yeah amen to that so is i imagine there's there's a lot of interest from farmers like what what's the potential like how how many farmers would would be growing hemp if they if it wasn't so difficult yeah um loads and loads and loads so last year um at the end of 2019 we did uh an outreach a farmer outreach program we went all around the country um with our our farm experts and we had farmer information evenings just to kind of teach them a little bit about the growing of the crop and the you know the harvesting and processing and it was amazing because uh you know tiny little villages around ireland and we had these packed rooms you know standing room only and people had traveled the length of breath country to come there and to hear about it and then so last year we had huge huge numbers of people applying for licenses to grow hemp in ireland but then the food safety authority of ireland published a report in february so just before the growing season uh here and in that report they declared that um cbd products so really high quality cbd products um on the market in ireland were all dangerous and they had a very visible media campaign uh where the ceo of that organization was on national radio and in the newspapers telling everybody that these were really dangerous and that they shouldn't um have anything to do with them uh so so what yes saw then was our seed suppliers having um you know cancelled orders all over the place and uh yeah so just pretty much uh you know destruction of the industry and then following on from that uh whenever they they removed all the the enterprise supports from the industry um what the the state did then was they they started to send and drug squad detectives to the homes of people who bought him products so we had um these bizarre uh instances where people you know would come home there was one man came home and found his mother and father at the kitchen table with two are with armed um drug squad detectives and some more armed guardian upstairs searching the house um for for hemp yeah it's madness madness yeah i mean you'd think they would have better things to do with their time and resources the police you really would and um you know only a couple of weeks ago i came across a place in balina in county mayo in ireland where a man i don't know who he is but i just came across it and i thought oh my goodness so this poor man um was convicted of criminal drugs charges for having 14 euros worth of industrial hemp um in his pocket in 2018 in ireland 14 euros worth of industrial hemp in his pocket i mean it's it's bizarre and outrageous yeah and you know it doesn't make any sense in a country like ireland i mean we could have such a wonderful um industry and a wonderful opportunity as well because we are such an agricultural nation and food producer and you know so yes that's pretty bad here yeah how about bright spots are there any any bright spots in the hemp industry in ireland i think there are bright spots um in spite of all of that i think we have a very vibrant industry here in spite of all of that so we have you know companies who are very long-standing um so empire building materials they've been going for uh you know since their very early 90s and that's marcus mccabe and then his wife kate runs kamehameha which is an amazing brand of food products from ireland so she she has that and then they together have processed i'd say maybe about 80 percent of all the hemp grown in ireland over the past two decades or so and marcus is a an agricultural scientist and he's a permaculture expert and they do everything in that vein and you know really clean really ethical farming and you know completely organic products and and so that's kind of where the information comes from in irish farming so you've got an awful lot of people wanting to follow that down the road then you have um you know new really new vibrant companies coming in in the cbd sector in the cannabinoid sector and great innovations as well in ireland so there's an awful lot and it's just very unfortunate in ireland that the state agencies um don't speak to the industry experts at all and so what you find is that um the irish government is regulating an industry that it doesn't understand and it has no clue about the science or the technology behind the industry and um but continues on regardless to introduce you know highly inappropriate regulations and legislation around the sector but you know and one of the great things and i hope this happens more broadly as well you know in terms of cbd regulation um across the world and not just in europe but you know the cjeu ruling in the kind of ape case in november and what happened there was that that finally and at long last somebody had to take account of the science and you know so that was the pivotal factor that that the european court of justice found that there was no valid scientific evidence to support any health concerns around the the thc in cannabidiol derived from hemp and because um there was no health concerns the court determines that that cannabidiol and hemp derived products are not controlled under the u.n single convention and because they're not controlled under the u.n single convention then they're not um they are entitled to exactly the same um kind of safety net as any other safe legal product within the european trade zone and so the problem with with ireland is that while every other european country came in line with that uh court ruling ireland has still not come in line with it and continues to arrest its uh industry stakeholders that's so frustrating so frustrating huh i know i know but we do as i said have you know very vibrant very determined actors here in in our industry so we have a couple of companies um and federation ireland companies who have judicial reviews underway so that will be that challenge and hopefully that will will protect the the retail sector and then currently our minister for agriculture is trying to split the farm license so that farmers can only grow fiber and then presumably the pharmaceutical industry will will be growing for cbd so capture the cbd side yeah yeah okay so they're trying to split our farm license at the moment so um would there will be another um legal challenge to that if they pursue that from from federation so i mean hopefully um at some point the the european law will will come into play and we will all be okay hopefully yeah let's hope for that yeah um well i wish you the best of luck in all of these endeavors thank you and i wish you great success thank you and uh it's very nice to meet you and talk to you today on this st patrick's day always lovely to meet you too all right that

to farm and make magic happen oh yeah this is third-generation farming right here you know I mean Mendocino counties finest Dukes in mindo tell me about your product tell me about the category you just won we just we did pretty well in the rosin and we did pretty well in the hash category we walked away with for JD maples and trophies tonight I don't know how many top-ten finishes and plaques we got but tonight we added on to the already 69 awards that we see nines a good number yeah it is yeah I was on the road to 100 this year I don't know if I'll come come a little for coming with full force but you know I'm stoked man my whole team we came hard it's a real stressful deal we go harder than a lot of people you know I don't know anybody that's gonna go as hard as us we do long restless nights and put it in hard for the mo cup it's it's a big deal it's like the Super Bowl hash this is the Emmys you know how much hash do you have to smoke while you're here out of the Emerald cup to make sure you keep it going strong we brought about four pounds of hash and then we brought some some flowers and stuff like that so we got some new products called solvent the sauce I want to smell yeah exactly it's you know you've heard of BHO sauce and stuff but we're actually doing the same thing with the crystals and the Terp juice but on a solvent list level so with no gases this is my boy right here Santi Santi with that how are you tell me about what you do with a lot of the hash making here at moonshine melts and third-gen family I've been taught a lot from this guy and we've been just aardeen a lot of product a lot of new stuff coming up for 2018 and I'm just super thankful to be playing around with so many great strains you know what I mean this man hunted not just one or two but 25 plus flavors that just dumped in the concentrates and yeah man I just a lot of respect to that and I'm so so stoked right now we got second in first Rasen second and third hash yeah I'm hyped waiting dude absolutely from the you know you said third generation from the time the you got into farming how how things change how things evolved in what's coming up in 2018 2018 is a big year that's why I said on stage I'm here to concentrate now on the next moves I've won almost every competition there is to win we have first-place high times first-place secret cup first place chalice and I'm not talking just first but first second third and we're we're hitting one after another we've been doing this for five years running we got probably almost 80 something awards not I haven't counted tonight but flour categories still going we're kicking it off 2018 is gonna be big when we first started farming and when my grandparents were growing my parents were growing it was chicken wire around trees and they were growing six plants here six plants there four here five there or whatever but now we went from that 204 we did 25 acres with Eddie leppe and then we got you know pinched down and everybody started buckling down and doing less and everybody went down to 99 s and 25 s and then now it's full bore going to open again and acres and acres and acres so it's really it's really difficult to judge from a mom-and-pop standpoint where this is going to go but we're just trying to grab it by the horns and hold on I think you're in the your the best path I mean number ones in every category congratulations you have this young man over here probably the wave of the next generation congratulations very excited for you 2017 and World Cup winners", "hOSD7zRbFnI": "we've seen that the big industries can be big bullies and the big bullies kind of help to set the laws or kind of wash across the top of the laws and it's not going to work anymore it's kind of how the game is working the testing is too sophisticated to test it and the chain of custody that you have to prove all the way back through the system certification and letters and things like that not to add additional burden to the farmer the key is to not try to add too much there but to add it to the next tier and to the next year there's actually checkpoints all the way through the system and so yeah that you're right though i mean these are things that have been in the industry causing problems yeah when you get an organic cotton t-shirt it was yeah there was questions about really",

initiative a shy is also another name for an albatross which is the bird with the longest wingspan in the animal kingdom we thought that was a good analogy for our hemp project because of all the amazing things that Him can do across a wide variety of industries our goal at shai is to provide reliability compliance accountability and high quality CBD from farm all the way through final product for the burgeoning hemp CBD industry the amazing thing about hemp as a crop and especially some of the more high CBD varieties is the medicinal benefits that come along with it not only is it a crop that can help remediate soils and can grow really sustainably it's also helping so many people around the world with all kinds of different conditions and being sustainable hemp initiative we know the book doesn't just stop with cannabinoids and CBD we really see hemp making a greater global impact in the areas of bio plastics hempcrete textiles and biofuels in addition to green initiatives we think that sustainability really has a lot to do with sustainable business practices this year we launched our first cooperative farm the goal of the cooperative is to help farmers across the country grow hemp we feel it's really important with not only our own farm but those in the shop the family that we have great genetics and great seeds the bottom line is that there's so many uses for hemp that by providing a cooperative to get people going they can take the plant and start to make other derivative products that the market hasn't even seen yet this farm would not exist without the hard work of 10 full-time employees along with dozens of other seasonal employees that help with our transplanting and our harvesting the core of our team are a group of people that have been working together for over a decade and I've been working at this farm long before it was even a hemp farm and when we took on the project to create a hemp farm here we really relied on their significant agricultural experience to continue the momentum into the hemp industry what started as a smaller kind of family operation we've been able to add to that family and add more quality people and this business is because of the people that we have here and all the hard work and determination and blood sweat and tears that goes into every single day last year we planted it harvested 15 acres there's a great success but we know that this year is really show time we planted 100 acres from clones and are now going to embark on a hundred acre harvest it's amazing to start with a field that's completely empty and prepped and ready to go for the season and then three months later be able to see a plant that has come into flower and that you can smell and touch and feel it's just an amazing part of the hemp industry and the hemp plant itself [Music]", "o0qJh0o903M": "what up YouTube welcome to another update over here in our garden alright everybody we're starting off over here in the veg tent big lady back there was Paris OG we got an alien og over there SF e OG SF e OG I think she's going on to hers or finishing her second week of veg she's approaching her second week of veg and she's leaving her third week of veg something like that this lady over here she's been begging for quite a lot quite a while I've been pushing her out getting her ready for the ceramic metal highlight tent you already harvested Balian OG in here so she's gone and done I'll show you guys some nugs when it's all dried up and [ __ ] and some shatter we got it was a quite a hefty yield I was pleasantly surprised last time I got around 250 grams of that ceramic metal highlights and I'm pretty sure I'm closer to the 300 gram point at this this round so really happy about that everything's looking really good over here no deficiencies no problems no [ __ ] other than the fact that this lady's talking up most of the light from these girls over here that's why they're not as big as they usually would be but it's not a big deal she's gonna move off to the ceramic bed of highlights in and a day or two once I clean it finish cleaning it out and these girls will have plenty of light and they'll be just fine now let's go off to the flower tent all right now we're looking at the flower tent everything is looking really good over here this is the beginning of the seventh week they're gonna be receiving nutrients for this whole week well yeah up until the eighth week then I'll start flush this is the sfe og looking really frosty looking really good show you guys it's dosa DOS looking really good nice and filled out strong 5x5 Paris OG back there s it vog right here don't see those right there the dosa dose this round we definitely have a little bit of improvement on the frost definitely a little bit of improvement on the frost but this is the last round that we're gonna grow how because we have no more clones of her and I'm probably gonna get a gorilla glue to replace er them before but everything is looking really good over here no problems no deficiencies just smooth easy run the HPS fixtures turned down to 600 watts and even out here in the outskirts of the 5x5 scrog it's a lot frost year than ceramic metal highlights hen and I'm not you know comparing yield or anything like that I'm talking about just false production these nuns are frost here on the outskirts of the 5x5 strong then the lugs were right under the ceramic metal highlights pictures so for some reason in my environment under my conditions the HPS picture completely outperforms the ceramic nor highlight picture but we did have an improvement of yield and and frost it's a little bit froster than the previous round so I'm gonna give of that picture another two to three rounds and then I'll get rid of it that's pretty much everything that's going on over here in our garden - guys I want to thank everyone for joining us don't forget to hit that notification bell subscribe share and drop a

hit it I mean like I was literally exhaling in the Campbell group and to shut the [ __ ] down so i will be posting pictures of the diamond OG but as far as a video for it sorry guys but i also picked this up to the high cleveland this is some straight up legit pure chemdog this isn't kim / if this isn't maui dog this ain't dog dog this is straight chemdog this is actually a request video i had believe it or not two different people in one day send me request asking if i'd ever tried chemdog or what was canned dog why did everything was one of the questions think was why did everything have chem dog in it who is kim dog well this is kim dog this is on 15 a gram 45 and eight is high quibble check out the twitter later for pictures i'm going to snap a picture right after i I'm afraid I'm going to cut the head off this so take a good look at it now the picture you're going to have the head chopped off but [ __ ] it so Kim dog and it smells like a real clean OG like it like like an the og cush without the punch in the face at the end more of a sweet more like a central element look I said I had a couple couple people asked me you know what it was these people don't have medical card from out of state so for those of you who have Kim to have had Kim dog and everything that you know know know what's up there with me like a real sour like I'm imagine like a sour Oh like a real strong sour OG but with a more of a sweet sweet hint at the end right at the end so that's what I can do for your smell smell now this is what I can do for you as far as a taste and Oh Mike said by lightest is this is one gram let slip chunkier than a gram so off with your head back only cut it up its got like almost like a stump that kicks and once it's cut up nice little top so I'd say I appreciate you you guys hit me up with questions everybody all I try to answer as many of them as I can so like I said this has happened to be on the menu it happened to look good like so i wouldn't try would have gotten it to do the review just it just to do with the review i mean it actually looked like some some pretty killer stuff so you know therefore i got no problems I you know meet a couple people's demands I shouldn't take demands but requests so so normally other conductor chem dogs I've had in the past it would be like a real salary taste to it maybe like a fruit finish a little bit of a fruit finish but usually more the sour comes through and that's why people tend to like that the chemdog and the headband so it's usually because of the taste it's got that chemically no right let's put it this way if you're not a stator and the state that doesn't have the meta pole and you have the ability to get some of this you'll know it as soon as you smell it like you know the most sour pungent but with a little bit of sweet to it yoyoyo know so it's actually straight I would keep it keep an eye out for its really got some really cool lineage to it I'm too high right now to tell you to tell you the linkage to it just get on Wikipedia whatever the [ __ ] and check out the lineage to it so here we go Kim DZ I'm already hired from the diamond OG which is a killer indica so flame on [ __ ] just as it smells leaves a nice little burning in the back here throat as it should so I would say that that's probably the medium expansion if you notice how the coffer

virtually surrounded by states that have legal marijuana in some form or another so we traveled to Huntington Oregon that's the closest place to Boise where pot is being legally grown and sold to get an inside look at this expanding industry not many people knew much about pot jim Spiker man grew his first pot plant more than 50 years ago fast-forward quite a few years and pot became illegal I was all of a sudden not a criminal I was in demand now doing it legally 68 year old Spiker man has a lifetime of experience growing pot during the sixties a lot of people smoke pot and I had it in my mind why not grow pot so a few of my friends and I started in an old Orange Grove in the back of a Tustin California from surfers painter to family man the marijuana business has always been a constant in Spiker man's life everybody has different cloning techniques it's his unique experience that helped land him the job of head grower at burnt river farms in Huntington we're a completely organic operation around here just an hour-and-a-half drive from Idaho's capital city business is booming at this farm in Eastern Oregon it's really full circle here from the beginning of the crop to the finished retail ready product at the end Shawn McKay is the CEO of burnt river farms we plant several thousand plants by hand we tend to those plants all year by him manicuring them trimming and pruning them after Oregon legalized recreational marijuana Shawn McKay left his cushy government job as a rangeland ecologist and crop scientists to launch this operation I saw this as once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I figured government work would always be there for me McKay's crop gets its start here as seedlings in the greenhouse nursery here's a Salmon River we grow that for our locals here's some Samoa cookies a bubba kush while some of the plants thrive indoors other strains are moved outdoors into this field which is bare now but lush during the summer this massive fence protects the crop from Huntington's hungry to your population there's many pests everything loves it so you have to really learn to combat the things that are after it besides the general public to keep those other pests away Burt River farms has a state-of-the-art security system above and beyond what's required by Oregon law I think they're somewhere around 50 cameras here that are all fiber-optic cameras motion sensor night-vision that's more security than a traditional farm but McKay says his growing operation is guided as much by agricultural principles as any other farm we try to take those common agricultural practices of irrigation and soil management and pest management and apply that to cannabis production it's just a process of learning trial and error over the years it's been keenly developed into a highly technical trade as soon as the plants are about eight inches tall they receive metric ID tag and that tag will follow that plant all the way through retail ready product once this crop leaves the soil the process is far from over burnt River farm produces marijuana gummies oil hash and shatter all here on site very little of what we produce here makes it to the market as a raw cannabis product the finished product is distributed all throughout Oregon and right down the street in Huntington quad is big business in the tiny town of Huntington where there's always a steady stream of cars heading into town many with Idaho plates marijuana that crosses the border into Idaho is a criminal offense but Idaho State Police says there's been no increase in marijuana citations since pot shops opened in Oregon in fact there's been a decrease of people getting pulled over and caught by ISP with pot and ADA Canyon and peut counties regardless of where the plant is going marijuana money has been a boon for the sleepy town we go back and forth between the the two dispensaries in the school as the largest employer here in town Berndt River farms employs a minimum of 25 people year-round and brings in dozens more for harvest season this is one of the most labor-intensive crops that you will ever come across it's very hands-on there's very little machinery that's designed to accommodate our crop well it's big business in Huntington residents have been divided over pots since the dispensaries first popped up it's wrong it's wrong what they've done they've come and destroyed our town destroyed of a lot of people's feelings there's been a lot of hard feelings between people that have been born here and raised here it's still somewhat divided but based on the growing acceptance of marijuana the growers at burnt river farms are willing to bet it's only a matter of time before the rest of the nation relaxes its pot laws I think it's on its way the cats out of the bag and it'll be legal in every state eventually in eastern oregon gretchen parsons Idaho's News Channel seven", "kaOk-Cbpx_Y": "it's a new era medicinal marijuana is now legal in the state of Ohio growing it in order to help people with seizures chronic pain or cancer treatments requires knowledge of horticulture and lab testing and a new school is educating on all that and more here to talk about it is Kevin green VP of Admissions with the Cleveland School of cannabis here to talk about this new cannabis school here in Ohio welcome glad to be here all right tell us about the Cleveland School of cannabis this is all new to us I know right so the Cleveland School of cannabis is a education company focused on the workforce development specifically here right now in the state of Ohio we are a second state approved school for cannabis actually in the country and actually the only one east of Colorado and we offer four state approved programs which are in horticultural cannabis business medical application of cannabis and then our executive program which is a combination of all three if anyone's watching and saying I hard to get on board with this this is a very serious industry because it creates a number of jobs not to mention all the health benefits that these patients are going to get from being able to take advantage of medicinal marijuana yes you know the biggest thing that I think is great about this industry is that it is a new industry so that means there's so many ways to be a part of it you can be directly working with the plant you can be directly working with patients you can be an ancillary business that's supporting the industry like HVAC security the testing that's going to go on all the different things from lawyers say insurance because again it's a new industry and when new industries pop up it's new opportunities I always love to tell people in the gold rush the people that made the good money and long money were the people that were selling shovels and denom not the people that we're digging for gold so we're looking forward to all the opportunities that's going to be available for all the people in Ohio alright let's talk about the educate education the education is required in order to get this up and running in order to get these industries involved with the cannabis business and I think that's one of the biggest keys is that most people think hey you know you can just jump right into this but education will be key to the due to the fact that we need cultivators they're able to produce the best product cuz we're talking about servicing patients in the medication that they need and also when you think about a dispensary that's going to be the one-on-one consulting that's going to be happening so our dispensaries need to be educated not only on what's going on with the qualified conditions but how to best place patients with the medication they need to help their illnesses and that's the whole key with education we want to make sure that we're able to service patients properly and do this the right way so education will always be key in the industry and again new industry and we're finally coming to the light there's so many more things that has to be that will be learned about cannabis and what this plant will do from not only a textile but also a medication standpoint something I found interesting when I got on to the Cleveland School of cannabis is website you guys are not just providing education on how to grow the plant how to maintain the plan or how to lab test the plant it's also educating on the attorney your guys are educating attorneys and lawyers and patients who will be receiving the medicinal marijuana yes we come from a real holistic approach we know that there's so many different avenues that affected people's life when it comes to marijuana and a history of marijuana especially within the United States so we want to make sure that people are educated in all different levels because they're coming with so much misinformation so we want to make sure people understand what's going on legally here in Ohio and how to go ahead and make sure that they are up to par and abiding by all the laws we want to make sure that especially our lawyers that will be supporting direct marijuana businesses but also could be supporting patients as well understand how to be able to be able to do so we know we've even had doctors that have come into our school and been a part of it because the endocannabinoid system is not something that has been in the general medical book so doctors that have been practicing for 40 years are now getting re-educating and re-energized a part of something that they can go ahead and help new patients I want to touch on you guys are hoping to expand into Columbus how is that yes so we're gonna be looking to expand the Columbus multiple different ways the first way is going to be community engagement we feel it's very important to build a relationship so we'll be doing an open house every every month here in Columbus at the Blackwell hotel we'll also be hosting our MCC course which we call our medical comprehensive course which is a nice weekend course so it gives you a good overview of the cannabis industry so you'll touch on everything from history of cannabis to patient navigation to cannabis law and then we'll also be launching our online program starting this August so we want to be able to provide Columbus but not only the state Ohio multiple different ways to be able to get involved get educated for their needs how can students sign up for classes it is now the time to do that yes you'll be able to sign up for classes right away by going to CSC education com there we always urge everyone please download our course catalog go through all the information understand exactly what we provide and what you're getting into you can please sign up for one of our events so you can go ahead and meet with us and so your questions we want to make sure that we help you through the process as good as possible so CSC education comm is the best place to get that information excellent

"smoke is also having an impact on a local crop which relies on adequate sunlight NBC 5's Emily Beale explains at Butte Creek Farms an Eagle Point marijuana spans the land they have 20,000 marijuana plants growing usually the peak time for those marijuana plants to blossom is in the summer sunshine here in the Rogue Valley but with the Sun almost completely covered by smoke from fires across Southern Oregon it's affecting how their crop is being grown and they estimate the financial damage could be huge total financial hit could be well over a million dollars for a farm of this size Butte Creek Farms opened just over a year ago and is already one of the biggest marijuana farms in the entire state their decision to be an outdoor farm as opposed to a greenhouse farm was intentional that's why we're an outdoor farm as we get the free sunshine and they rely on that free sunshine to keep their business afloat they need that spectrum to get all those nutrients to continue to grow and flourish like we want them to but the lack of Sun from the thick smoke is affecting the plants growth is what helps the buds grow bigger getting all this spectrum from the Sun we're missing out on so much of that right now that is really causing a damper in the plants growth cycle so the main visible effect is that they're not as large as they should be so for example this should be bigger right now yes but is Butte creeks biggest moneymaker a pound of it can cost up to twelve hundred dollars multiply that by the bud they get from each of their twenty thousand plants and the potential financial loss could be massive in Eagle Point Emily Beale nbc5 news Slauson says despite being smaller their first harvest potency and quality was normal however now the ash lack of Sun and humidity are causing mold to form on some plants he's hoping it won't impact their next round of tests", "vmF1uGovv1I": "now hemp might officially be on its way to Texas the Commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture is holding a public hearing tomorrow morning for comments on the Texas hamper rules commissioner Sid Miller says these proposed new rules were published so people can take a look at them and voice any concerns they might have they'll then take everything into consideration before officially submitting the rules to the USDA for review the farmers are grouping together I signed a petition another day that that was already had over ten thousand signatures from farmers so we're hoping the USDA as well as the TDA has it here to hear what the farmers have to say once the USDA approves the final items rules these Texas farmers can begin or in Texas that is as the state can begin granting licenses to farmers who might want to grow hemp as a cash crop in Texas so starting the conversation on what hemp can do for Texas as a big step forward so many people can benefit from production of hemp and farming a lot of our farmers have gone bankrupt it's gonna bring new life into Texas communities if you're interested in taking part in the public hearing again it will be tomorrow morning at 9:00 at the Texas Farm Bureau Conference Center in Waco", "HEpqUh2cURw":

I have a phone you guys ought to tell me I've been around a person with chronic virus this just seems like they can just tell anybody you've been around on the virus and when they stand when they say that when they ping your phone and they say that you've been around scrolling virus they come take your kids they take your kids put them into foster care to take you and bring you wherever they take

boy like when you're like anywhere from like three to five maybe even six or seven you call him boy but when I start getting older at least for me after about eight or nine I started being like you don't really like that boy's [ __ ] I think I did that because I I heard either I heard it or my mom told me a story that somebody I called my dad boy one time then [ __ ] flip the script on him so um

that sound like rub deal at all I'm not no drug dealer I'm no stinking drug dealer I smoke weed that is really really really tasty you guys you know I've said before I've said to me in times I've never had a good strain of Kim dogwood got dang it whoa I almost caught me off guard there okay scale one to ten one being it works it could be Tim being that [ __ ] for the flavor critique of this Tim dog number four we're gonna have to critique this flavor at it's a really nice flavor but it's really mild I can taste it Kim dog but it's fooling me because you guys remember I told you I never had a good strain of Kim dog so by me not having a good strain of Kim dog me tasting this Kim dogs like all here we go that [ __ ] me psychologically be affecting my buzz no it's not the buzz is kicking in even more so on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that [ __ ] of the flavor critique of Kim dog number four we're gonna give this a whoo hey we're gonna give it eight we'll give it a eight we have to you know access memory on that you'll see when the weed hit me I started getting spunky I even sat up all the way here we go oh by the way this is this big tree great so what I recommend Kim dogs number four to my friends check it out y'all try some kim dong number four if you get a chance now I don't know if there's a difference between up dispensary grading street grade on this particular strand however if you get a chance to try kim dog number for dispensary grade gettext you the shot y'all I bet you give the same grade out given we don't give it a 8 yeah we don't give an April flavor it's making me feel so cool wow this high started remind me of um hit knock I keep getting too mixed up I can't remember I had hidden off for a head banger I'm pretty sure its head knockers but it's kind of the highest kind of reminded me of that this high is just it's smooth kicking in it's light it's accelerating like I say like a Tesla not kind of not like a test let's move a little slower than that why my bubbling is it's accelerating like your car you know I'm saying just a steady pickup put your foot on the gas and just keep pushing like this and that's how this high feels funny mmm even as I'm talking getting higher and higher I can feel it right here it feels so good and they said that this is indica dominant [ __ ] out of here with that this ain't no indica dominant it's gotta be sativa dominant I'm not saying that that scientifically it's the TV dominant because it is though indica dominant but I'm saying by me smoking it in the high that I feel right now I feel like hey Macarena oh you know I'm saying this [ __ ] made me feel like more to the beach it could possibly be because I just woke up I don't think so because I feel you know I've been telling I told my mom yes sir that's it I said ma you know something I said for the last couple weeks or the last couple of months I've been feeling fan-fucking-tastic I mean I just feel I feel awesome like I can't explain it you guys I feel like like legendary I feel like a Christians joy I'm not Christian but I'm just saying I feel like like that joy like I feel so happy it's I don't know what it's from man it couldn't be from smoking eggs on it's all the time cuz I switched my Maya we diet from straight from loud and good we two straight exotics that's all I smoked now and if it's just the exotics that's doing this to me you guys need to get on an exotic diet I feel great it could be because there it could be the fact that I'm vegetarian I don't eat any meat because after I stopped eating meat I thought I felt really great I asked the question on Oh on Facebook and I probably ask you guys this already I said um do you guys believe that animals have souls overwhelmingly everybody came away of course when you look into the little eyes you can see that fluffy has a soul when I look at meow-meow I can see that meow-meow has a soul my horse has a soul animals yes they have a soul certain animals don't I'm like what do you mean certain animals don't what do you mean well animals do have souls I said if animals have souls inviting [ __ ] y'all eating them in it just doesn't make sense well we believe that once you die that the soul leaves the body ok but that's it don't you believe that there's some residual effects of a soul being in this body this was a soul carrying body now is soul is you don't think this on residual sick mrs. and illnesses and [ __ ] sitting in there you guys know the true key to diabetes from eating red meat do you know that you get dementia from eating red meat do you know that from eating red meat causes high blood pressure [ __ ] I want all that for I don't want none of that and vegetables do the exact opposite well [ __ ] I want all of that [ __ ] I want to be healthy I want to be able to [ __ ] I'm 53 years old man and I guarantee I can jump over that car man I guarantee I can outrun any of y'all in the foot race probably I'll lift a lot of y'all man cuz you know I'm I'm in there man boxing kickboxing we can do it all baby 53 years old man I'm still doing this [ __ ] I can still put my forehead on my knees man not like this but standing up you know I'm saying man telling y'all man baby I'm still trying at all anyway you guys on a scale of one to ten one being a [ __ ] Tim beating

across North America and believe it or not one of the key battlegrounds is in the tiny community of mechanic Nova Scotia a man there has been giving away a marijuana extract local residents and some others around the world believe it's a cure for cancer and many other diseases but now Rick Stinson is hiding out in Amsterdam fearing if he returns home he will be arrested on the spot here's Global's Devens people if I go back to Canada they will write down charge me an L put me in jail it all surrounds this thick black hemp oil Rick Simpson has been making it from marijuana buds for years but while in Amsterdam last week RCMP raided his property and I know they won't give me bail because I'm not like a three-time loser and if I go to jail with no bail and no medicine it'll probably kill me I'm not willing to commit suicide for mr. Harper [Music] you [Music] and I was a young boy growing up I was proud to be a Canadian we were beloved around the world for our efforts World War two and our reputation as being generous compassionate [Music] Canada was a world leader showing the strength of our ancestor and our innovative nature uniting a country through all its different terrains and all its different people [Music] in this fast beautiful [Music] but was it all an illusion over time the Canada that I knew began to change it seems that policy began taking precedence over people [Music] I heard stories of a man in on the Nova Scotia who claimed to have killed people of cancer using cannabis [Music] have the government suppress cure for cancer and had it been discovered right here in Eastern Canada I'm not sure if I believed it at first but I did have the opportunity to meet miss Pam coming up the Rick Simpsons house it's been gone for quite a while it's a great thing that he's back and we get a chance to talk to him here it's always a hard drive way to kid he'd almost died right by it never know it we're when this driveway used to be just full of cars every time I come hey there big guy just so I'll be leaving again another day or two the story really begins in 1969 when my 22 year old cousin was diagnosed with cancer they did an operation and then afterwards I believe they give him chemo and he dropped from 200 pounds down to 120 pounds then three years later in 1972 well that actually the doctors had said at the time they thought they got it all but three years later in 1972 he came home on vacation and we were talking one day and he collapsed right in front of me and I suspected it was probably the cancer back but I was hoping it wasn't and of course he went back to Ontario and as soon as he wouldn't seen the doctors they just said you've got three or six months to live so he came back to Spring Hill and within three months he was dead and I watched him grate down to about 55 pounds it was just horrible my cousin was more like a brother to me we grew up together in the country we knew each other intimately so it really affected me quite badly and then about three years later I was leaving work one day I worked at All Saints Hospital in Spring Hill I just got in the car and I turned on the radio and the local radio station in Amherst CK th-they were reading a report on the radio station of the THC the active ingredient in marijuana killing cancer cells and of course the announcer was laughing like a fool when he was making these statements so I didn't know whether to take it seriously or not but you know time went on and I never heard nothing more about THC killing cancer cells or anything so I thought it was just some type of hoax in 1997 I had a severe head injury at work I wound up with what they call a post concussion syndrome my head rings 24 hours a day then that in turn that brings your blood pressure up I had a lot of balance issues from the injury and things like that so I mean I went through the medical system I took their pills for five years I took every chemical he threw at me but they did nothing but make me worse and then in 1998 well 1998 about a year after I was injured I've seen an episode of the nature of things with dr. David Suzuki called reefer madness - and it showed all these people on there smoking pot for their medical problems and they were being helped that was you know quite desperate so I'm a note and I got some pot from the friends I you know nearby and I smoked it and it did more for me than anything the doctors are giving me so I went to back to the doctor's every doctor I seen I asked them for prescriptions for him but not one doctor would give me a prescription then in 1999 I was in my doctor's office and when I was talking to him I course I was always asking for a prescription and again he refused me but I asked the doctor that day when I was in there I said you know what would you think if I in you know as opposed to smoking the plant material what would you think if I made the essential oil of the plant and ingested it and the doctor said that that would be a much more medicinal way to use the substance but he still wouldn't give me a prescription this is all grown in now this was all this was all plans then in 2001 they called me into his office they told me that they'd give me everything that they had to offer and nothing was helping me so I was on my own and again I asked the doctor for a prescription for him again I was refused and I mean the doctor knew that this was the only thing that was helping me and he also knew that if I was caught with with hemp that I would be charged as a criminal because he didn't give me a prescription so you know I was kind of left between the devil and the deep blue sea I mean what am I supposed to do so much happening all these other countries there's nothing going to happen here unless forced now I didn't know anything about what the oil would do I was very afraid of this substance in the beginning you know I mean I knew smoking pot was wasn't harmful but but this oil is really it's a concentrate you know it's a very powerful concentrate I just you know started taking ul on a steady basis and I started getting more sleep so you but the condition I have the ringing in the head 24 hours it stops you from sleeping and all the pills they gave me they couldn't give me they never gave me one pill that would put me to sleep so the oil really was working miracles for me in that way and what happened it started I started losing all this weight and it was scary in the beginning because I thought you know like it was hurting me but my weight dropped from about 185 190 down to 160 and then it just leveled off and my arthritis in my knees that disappeared like in 2002 I went to see the doctor about this in cancer I had I had three areas I had one here in my cheek and one of my chest and one right there by my eye and I always I had these things from the night since the 1990s and I always suspected that they were probably skin cancer so when the doctor looked at them I mean he told me he said I can't be sure until I get the pathology report back but he said it does look like skin cancer and they were really concerned with that one next to my eye so that you know because the proximity to the eye could cause a lot of problems so they scheduled me to go in have that when removed first and then I was to go in at a later date and have the other two removed so I went in I think was around the end of January 2003 and they operate it right here on the eye and it was about a week after the operation I was sitting home and I got this magnified mirror and I was looking at you know where they had done the operation and of course it was infected I was sitting there looking at the area where they had operated and that's when that report I'd heard on the radio popped back into my head about THC you know killing cancer cells and I'd heard that back in the 70s well by that time I had been taking you out for about a year you know and it helped me in many ways like my thinking processes had cleared up you know I was pretty well back to normal but I really didn't think you know where I'd been taking the oil for so long I thought well THC killed cancer well I didn't acure my cancer well you know why do I still have this and I hate to say it but I almost didn't do it I almost didn't apply the oil I thought you know if the medical system if there was a cure for cancer surely the medical system would be using it that that was my assumption at the time I had the oil right there anyway because I was ingesting it to help me sleep so I just took a little bit of oil and I put a little bit on bandages two bandages and I put one on the cheek and one on my chest I never felt a thing you know before that I was getting these sensations like I had splinters in my face and as soon as I put the oil on that sensation went away but there was there was no feeling that anything was happening so four days later I had the I left the bandages in place for four days and then I went down to the bathroom and when I took the bandages off I was just shocked because it was all healed it was just pink skin on both most places and of course then I started telling my friends you know like I cured my cancer with marijuana her oil made from the cannabis plant plant and people just laughed at me you know like you're crazy after a few weeks of people laughing at me they turned this one that they had surgically removed it came right back and I watched it develop and that same swelling in the bleeding in the the splitter a feeling in the face so I just put a little dab oil to bandage put it on there left it on for four days when I removed it was all healed just pink skin now that's this is 2012 that was back in 2003 when I did the early early 2003 when I did this I've never retreated these spots so once I I seen this one heal up then I went down to my doctor's office because they had taken a sample when they when they done the operation so I went down to get the pathology report when I went in and I asked the doctor's wife she was the receptionist the doctor's wife so I asked her for a copy of the report and I looked at it and it said write on the report basal cell carcinoma that's skin cancer so I told her that day I said that you know the that cancer had returned and so I explained to her that I had cured that cancer and the other two using hemp oil and the minute I said hemp oil the woman just went ballistic I mean I was in my doctor's waiting room there was five or six other patients there and as soon as I said hemp oil you could just see her like she hunched she was like that and the doctor will not go there the doctor will not prescribe this you know and she was doing it very loudly and matter-of-fact I for a little while there I thought the woman was some kind of in that case so I got in my truck that day and I on the way home I was it was a really strange feeling trying to figure you know what are these people doing I mean if I was a doctor and a patient of mine came in and said that they had cured their cancer I would be interested in it but this doctor and his wife had no interest in it so it smelled kind of fishy to me I didn't really know what to do at that point you know I had no choice I had to stay on the oil because it's the only medication that worked for me and right after I visited my doctor's office I went down and seen my mother and she had weeping psoriasis on her foot and lower leg and so we used the oil to heal that I started supplying oil you know like the different people I knew was skin condition I started offering the oil to people I knew and it it was working on everything and then more people like their friends would come so it was building and building all the time I started a campaign in 2003 to alert the government I mean I went to all the political parties I went to the Cancer Society we even went to the United Nations we went everywhere about this you know nobody would lift a finger how long to take the plan all that Oh we worked two or three days you know actually longer than that because I built up some of the beds and raised them up a bit so the plants would grow better but there was a lot of work went into it and some of my patients come over and they help me plant it so I didn't do it just alone but it was quite an effort more like a community effort than anything else right wow that's pretty incredible well when the patient's seen what the medicine would do they backed it 2005 I came in contact with Rick Dwyer over here at the Legion in Mac and I had treated a lady with cancer and she had told Rick about you know how she was cancer-free and what had cured her so Rick Dwyer wanted to meet me so when I went over Rick and I we had a good talk and then he went with me because at that time I was actually treating people in their homes so when Rick Dwyer seen what the oil was doing himself and he knew some of the patients also so when Rick seen it himself we decided that it you know that the Legion should do something about this so Rick get in touch with George decline at maritime command in Halifax and he told them about this and matter of fact he contacted and I believe three times you know to do something about this because all the membership of the branch 134 over here in Matt can they were behind this even even the executive they had put a letter out in the paper that you know we wanted to do an honest and open review of this medicine and we invited the police the the doctors the Cumberland Health Authority all of them you know come to the meeting and I was gonna bring patients but that first that never happened you have to watch yourself because some of this was built up here in that where I was planning so how long it's been almost two years since you've been here 2009 was the last crop that was there was only about a hundred and fifty plants in 2009 in the back yard once I put 250 in but I had to take out the mail so that only left about about 150 and before that like I said 2006 there was 1100 2005 there was 1600 and then in 2003 I had I think it was about 135 down by the river you know down off my land but it was down by the river and that was that's the year they did the first rate well I never hit anything I openly stated rate in the video that we shot in 2005 that I was going to grow the plant straight in my backyard I made no secret of it and I told everyone what it was for it was fermented medicinal use for whoever needed it I put 1620 plants in my backyard in 2005 I sent the RCMP a videotape may 6 2005 I took the videotape in as a matter of fact Rick Dwyer came with me and videoed me giving it to the RCMP because I didn't want them saying that they never received it and I also gave them some paperwork asking that local politicians be charged with criminal negligence causing death so three months later on August 3rd 2005 the police came in and raided me I really thought that you know the government would take an interest and within a matter of six months I figured this medicine would be becoming available but instead they did just the opposite they they persecuted me and it was just horrifying when I when I realized you know what they were all about oh they put on quite a show here you know one of them you actually stayed here on the deck with me a female officer stayed here on the deck with me while her fellow officers were down there cutting the the cannabis down and she told me right there on the deck that day she said I believe everything you're saying and I just looked at her and I said you know this cures cancer I said you know what are you doing where are your morals you know your friends are down there cutting down the cure for cancer for God's sakes know what's wrong with you people then she just clammed up she wouldn't talk anymore how many treatments did you lose like do you figure oh well Dave you just take the numbers alone I mean when you look at the 1,620 plants in 2005 another 1,100 planes in 2006 well you're talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of treatments you know that people didn't get and I was giving it away for nothing and people were waiting for that did you oh yes yes a lot of people are waiting in 2006 when the RCMP came in again and did just the second rate year third grade then actually the community was outraged you know that's when we decided to call the meeting and invite you know the health of the Health Authority everyone in the police the doctors all of them bring them in here's the patients now let's have an open conversation about this but the day that was to take place the Royal Canadian Legion maritime command with the aid of the RCMP they came in and they shut our local Legion branch down so it just blew my mind you know when you look at the the Legion zone handbook it says you know they're there to represent the interests of veterans and their families you know so they should have done something about this but instead they got right in bed with the government and went along with shutting the Legion down and everything and that's the reason I've stated that as far as I'm concerned the Royal Canadian Legion is a total fraud it should be disbanded and the same goes for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police because there was only one word for them and that's pathetic I know we need police but we need policemen that you can respect I have no respect for these people anybody that's out there raiding medicinal users and taking their medicine how can you respect them in mccann Nova Scotia this oil is gaining a reputation as a miracle drug extracted from marijuana plants Rick Simpson has been making it and giving it to friends and neighbors he calls it hemp oil others know it as we dial in small doses he says it makes you well without getting you high well you can't deny your own eyes Kenya no here's somebody dying from cancer they're not dying anymore here's somebody that had something else well they're cured and this is what's doing it the McCann branch of the Royal Canadian Legion was impressed - so impressed it hosted meetings like this one aimed at spreading the word about hemp oil but when they planned a big public meeting higher-ups at the Legion shut them down provincial kind man came here the day of the meeting and they come in they lock the doors and then I come into the air and I had to our CMP officers here that told me I was not allowed on the property they're using royal the Royal Canadian Legion it's named its instincts and insignias and the buildings - as a platform to promote the use of hemp oil as a medicinal drug I don't care if these medicine comes from a tomato plant a potato plant or a hemp plant if the medicine safe and helps and works why not use it for Rick Dwyer it's an emotional issue one of the Testaments to heavens healing power is his father the military veteran suffering from lung cancer last time I didn't know but they said I was going to die in 24 hours what I didn't so I took - but the Legion isn't budging they've suspended the entire executive of this branch along with any activities planned for the building until they install a new management team there is no provincial or federal regulation which states that this marijuana can be grown and produced into hemp oil for medicinal purposes and therefore it's illegal as far as the province is concerned and the Royal Canadian Legion does not back illegal operations Simpson has had trouble with the law the RCMP confiscated 1,600 marijuana plants from his backyard last year plants he claims were grown for medicinal purposes a court case is unresolved and so are questions within the Legion about whether hemp oil is medicine or menace that goes against the general bylaws of the Royal Canadian Legion what I did I'm proud of what I did I'm proud of it and for now since the Legion is the town's only meeting place getting the word out about hemp oil will prove to be more difficult in mccann Nova Scotia this is Global Nationals Ross Lord reporting this is all covered in and Wharf pictures of our pictures of our veterans and everything in here was this office we used to some of us would come down here and this whole office and and figure out you know what he's gonna do fundraisers and stuff we had a lot of fundraisers here for the community like for sick people and and stuff like that we would put a lot on further and he said how long you were in illusion loves 20 years I had my 20 year panic in 1995 I became president and I was secretary for a short term past president for 10 years I also was Pingo chairman at one time entertainment chairman so pretty well yeah I'm very proud to be one at that time I guess we did really did a lot here at this Legion for the help the community and we accomplished a lot of things here we I like what you said there about being the government watchdog because this is where it was really put to the test and that's where failed yeah well we are the government watchdog the Royal Canadian Legion is here to protect everything that the soldiers fought and died for and continue to do today and that's our Charter of Rights in their constitution our freedom of speech and and our right to question our government and to actually call them in and say hey you know what's going on here like you know these we got a problem here has to look Royal Canadian Legion members here want to know why why that you people haven't answered mr. Simpson back like way I mean why does this ever after I have to come to the Legion like why did this have to come to us you know this man this man had discovered something there can be no question about that we want to know why you folks haven't checked this out something that's important you know I mean people's health you know and I'm you'd have to be a complete imbecile to to think that that this man if he's some kind of criminal I really don't want to try to make him out to be would be going all over Cumberland County contacting politicians and contacting medical people on everything across the country he didn't hide anything and this is what amazed me at first when when he first came to us and I looked at the amount of people that he had contacted in the country I thought wow you know these people not one of them I mean he wrote letters they answered him back but nobody ever came to check out to see if there was any validity to what he would say but when he came here you know I was talking to the executive and I said you know this guy's discovered something I can tell you that because I talked to a number of his patients and and he's showing me like the Guzman studies and the Virginia studies and and all these other studies and so I mean I think basically what they were all thinking at that time is he had a great he had to create nine education because I know I thought of that at the time I said well how do you know all this stuff like you know you're not a doctor and he he said he had cancer you know on us here and over here and there and Who am I to say he wasn't telling he had his pathology reports that said he had basis all carcinoma mr. Cecil hike was the same way and others so he come here told us basically what what he was going through and basically his father was a veteran and I felt an obligation and so did the rest of us here at the time but then you turn around and and you say hey you know we have a right to send these people letter and ask them to come in let's check this out let's see if there's anything to this but then events seemed to get out of hand like you know he was trying to keep this thing you know in hand here by corresponding and you know being as polite as we could but I come to the point where it's starting to get frustrating and and so I just kind of said to the executive there you know like come on now guys for God's sakes you know if this is this is all true which it appears to be you know how many Canadians are you know suffering here with these these problems that this that's again it amazed me is like I said to my family doctor I said look I'm no doctor but I'm not blind I can see cancer on somebody's face disappearing you don't have to be a doctor to see that and say hey was it this oil that that cured I died and then he put the oil on somebody else's cancer and it would do the same well you got a logically you got to start thinking well it was either that or like cured it up or this man's got some kind of godlike powers that heal these people up you know and basically I said no it's the oil is the oil doing this it wasn't unusual to see you know four or five six pairs in my yard that was quite quite normal for around here I had a I had a very large clientele yeah like I said it wasn't about the money I mean if I had the medicine and I if I could grow the plants and produce the medicine I was giving it away but the man got so great and with the police you know taking my crops the only other thing you could do then was to go out and buy the the material needed from local growers so a lot of the time I acted like more like the middleman between the patients and you know and the growers I was arrested I was charged with trafficking possession and cultivation you know I mean well I had to I had to cultivate the medicine or the plants to make the medicine and to give it to people I had to possess the medicine and as for trafficking well if you look at the dictionary definition of trafficking it says the exchange of goods for monetary gain I didn't gain anything there was so it really wasn't trafficking I mean I was giving the medicine away but of course the legal system they have a different definition for trafficking so this law went on I mean I started then down the road through the court through that or through the legal system in Canada and that's a horrifying experience believe me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] baby babe [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hope travel to pray I have step [Music]"}
