{"n0U8RdRdFDU": "[Music] the can tink of French bread or artisan breads or I'm taking our baguettes so we're gonna show you how easy it is to make so know this recipe is a little bit different it does take some time but it's all about building flavor so it actually takes a couple of days to actually make this dough from start to finish which I know seems a little bit daunting but I promise you the results are so so worth it so what's a little bit different here with this bread recipe is what we're gonna be making what we call a pre fermented dough so basically it's a dough that's made in advance of our main dough which we allow to ferment so how to maximize flavor and then that's what that Dolby uses the base of which will build our final dough so firstly just to get a little proof minted dog started we're using simply 450 grams of strong flour but a half a teaspoon but 7 grams of salt simply mix that straight in we're adding 245 mils of water and we're simply gonna take about 5 grams of fresh yeast so this is fresh yeast I don't know if you've ever used it or ever seen it but don't get too hung up over fresh versus dried a lot of a kind of comes down to what your backs to and tradition fresh he's lonely keep about two to three weeks you keep in your fridge unlike dried yeast which is kind of much more in line with the home baker and you keep for several months but also dried you so much more concentrated so we tend to use less of it generally the ratio is about 3 is to 1 so if you use about 20 grams of fresh it'd be about 7 grams of dried but at these small levels that were working at or only 500 grams of our easiest ratio is just to go off for about 2 to 1 so we're using 5 grams of fresh so simply your obably just looking at about a generous pinch of dried yeast is all we need it's just enough to get our dough working and that is it that's all it is for our proof minted oh so we're simply to combine in all our ingredients together so then once the dough roughly comes together simply just dump it straight out onto the table so what you want to do at this point is you want to knead our dough so I'm like kind of most bread recipes where you could find ourselves needing here for the next 8 10 minutes we're simply just doing enough just to bring it over roughly together because at that point we're simply is gonna pop it straight in the fridge and it's gonna sit there overnight for at least 12 to 24 hour so the idea is at a cooler temperature the East will still continue to work it's going to develop loads and loads of flavor within our dough and we're simply going to use this dough as the base denim which every gets are gonna be based because what we say the longer you prove it the better there is a limit to how long you can ferment your dough for and to lose a strand and break down so that's why we look at ways in which we can build flavor so be a true preformance you use a likes of starter cultures or polishes and with this one we're using a pre fermented dough just a minute or so that's all we need and at this point then the taker dose gonna pop it into a bowl into a fridge and the same happy sit there for at least 24 hours [Music] this the exact same dough which we just left sitting in a fridge overnight so you can see how it's proven so it's this though then that we're gonna base our baguette a partner we've got 24 hours of flavor right here so now we're gonna build the next level of flavor so once again we're taking 500 grams of strong flare then we're increasing our salt a little bit here so we want a good 10 grams right in 300 mils of water and we're just adding 10 grams of fresh yeast and again if you're using just dried yeast just go with 5 grams is all you need that can be simply just crumbled straight in so to that though then we're adding all of our pre fermented dough you'll find it easier to incorporate into your dough if you break it up into smaller little pieces because if you just try knead it in one solid piece of dough you're gonna find it much harder like your thyroid OHS is all about time it's all about developing flavor too much things in our life were in a hurry for so if you can give your bread as much time as you can and realistically the amount of work you have to put in it's very very minimal like you saw with the first part of the recipe there's simply Dunedin of the Cree fermented dough you only probably took about two minutes in the fridge and leave it be it's just a little bit of planning that's all so we start to combine all our ingredients together you probably find is still a little bit harder to kind of work together just because we've got the the pre fermented dough in there so let's take a little bit it's to mix everything [Music] so wants to know roughly comes together simply it's going straight out onto her table and again already told a star to need working that flowerin working it all together so this dough it's going to give you about fifteen hundred grams worth of dough so it would each be get done at about 250 grams it's going to give us six I know my feel like it's to money for yourself that's why it's a great way to bake for friends family and actually did the door once it's bate who actually freeze very very well no problem whatsoever you can freeze the base baguette toward out at room temperature and simply then once it's toid i with dampen her you running tap popping it back into a hot oven at 190 degrees for about eight to ten minutes if I lie with the door to warm up warm right right to the center so the idea of the moisture by wetting the bread stops the dough from drying out dry as the moisture off and it'll crisp up like today a commodity oven so it's a great way you can pop a few in the freezer bake here we get once a week you have fresh bread every day so you will find you don't might be low if it's off a little bit sticky resist that temptation to add flare but if we keep adding flour the dough will quite happy soak it up and your door just becomes heavier and heavier and tighter and tighter so we want to soft loose dough so you can use one hand you can use two hands whatever you want if you ever want to know the secret to firm arms knead bread and this is what makes bread fat free but only if you make it yourself he's usually dough scraper bring it back together and keep working at all so you'll be looking at approximately about eight minutes for the dough to come together and develop fully thing is it's very difficult for recipe to be exact some people are stronger than others some days you're just tired so the dough will always tell you when it's ready so there's a thing called the windowpane effect so you should better stretch your dough so there's virtually suit you and I should be on a sustained it's always but without ripping and without tearing so simply just slowly stretching the dough I work it out you can see is getting there it's getting like the elastic but it's just a grid just aerated here and that's just the don't tell me it's not ready so I needs a little bit more work so continue to need if you do have a mixer feel free to use it the dough hooks gonna do exactly the same thing that your hands are doing personally I like to get my hands in there play to get stuck in allows you to get a feel and an understanding for the dough or dough it's just there now all come together so it comes to testing you know again a little bit of oil on your hands it makes it all much easier to handle too easy to manipulate and as well as having firm arms you can have lovely soft hands so when you're testing your dough cut off a decent piece and when you test it don't just kind of come out here to the edge in credit or is the center and you're slowly nice and gently what can you do when side to side use and head of its own way to stretch it so as you can see it it's lovely elastics the lights almost kind of passing through it and there you are when we tried it was just ripping it was tearing and wasn't holding that's holding exactly now what we want and that's simply it so we're to still bring back together and the thing I love about this dough as this dough will hold perfectly in the fridge for up to 36 hours which means you can have the dough made we could take a little bit off this now pop with one side maybe bake off two or three baguettes put the rest in the fridge you could take a little bit more tomorrow bake fresh again and again the third day so really allows you to have fresh bread day after day ideally I'd take this dough pop in the fridge and again leaving it overnight so now we're going from day one we've had a pre fermented dough day - we've met our baguette though day three we're ready to bake so it's three days maximum flavor and I promise you it's so so worth it just cover that over in the fridge I want to leave it to prove for a minimum about 18 hours [Music] now here's a lovely baguette though it's been left fermenting last 18 hours it's gonna knock her dough back so well it simply is looking to knock the air for my dough what size reapportion - I do - will largely depend on how big your oven is and at no point overall in 30 inch baguettes not gonna fit into your oven so I see only fine for most kind domestic ovens at home about 250 grams it's a really nice portion I'm gonna give you a baguette this sort of length which will generally perfect for most domestic opens alone so important 250 grams so one more portion or adult everyone concerns from come from around bases and they're from around base we can manipulate it and change it any way we like so if you were trying to roll the baguette from start to finish in one go you're gonna find them much much harder because the dough will naturally want to shrink back so you're gonna find we do everything in stages we build it up with loud AK dunes relax it and you find yet to put a half amount of effort into your dough so once our dough has been shaped we just want to rotten roll them rough kind of rectangular shapes so it simply pop you don't over stretch your I'd rent one over the other and we fall into the center we go again took it back in on itself and I don't fall in the place of our baguette so taking each edge one on top the other let's pin it down all the way from you back into the center took it back in there on up again so what we want to do now is one to let it I don't rest we're gonna let us sit on the table for a good 10 to 15 minutes before we got to roll it again because you'll find at the door it's been worked quite a bit quite tight now to do this all pulling back in so by leaving at rest allows a glutton to relax and you want to find a very easy to stretch and roll so squeeze out on your table leave it be you can crack on clean up whatever you need to do but time you come back you don't gonna be ready to go so we're gonna give that 10-15 minutes we'll come back and then we'll give it its final [Music] so I door is nicely rested so you can even feel the dough compared to a couple minutes ago I've been trying to stretch it it's much much lighter it's looser so much more pliable and much easy to work so we've got the base ever began as it is so we kind of want to try to work with that natural shape seems folding over just about and a half inch or so just seed it down we go again finally third time roll up as it ideas were applying pressure so I was one hand off the other playing pressure working from the center all the way out from the center all that so a lot of people kind of when they're rolling that they're going great get towards the end and then it's a coin so don't be afraid to use the space and then to get over the pointy edges said your hands roll off the edge so began send traditionally to proved in linen cloth material called Koosh which in French means sleep because basically better guess it's going to sleep so we popped it baguette into our sauce upside down so kind of accident like a proven basket I don't worry about a sourdough so y'all sit side by side instead of proving out till I'll prove up so again when you're rolling them don't be ready to use the space just kind of decide you ate everything get the whole piece of dough moving one hand slides off the other bit of pressure from the center all the way out from the center all the way out it's basically kind of just ignore the dough that's all it is so from the fridge once the dough has been portioned allow it to rest 10-15 minutes if you can and once rolled it will be ready to bake within an hour and a half [Music] [Music] there is any access to drive it overtook them in relief against the proof [Music] so I forget sigh ready to go they've proved doing nicely nice little bounce to them so the ideas we won't everyone approved about 90 percent the ideas that last 10 love comedy oven karlie oven spring so the idea is the door will hit the heat it's gonna jump it's gonna bounce in the oven and also I need to physically picked him up so I pick them up and transfer them onto my tray so when it comes to getting a baguette out we see me just roll a forward release it and then transfer it straight onto our tray simply just pop your fingers in because you're not just pulling from here because if you do you kind of drag this one with you just pop your fingers underneath rolling from the floor and it's on to our tray fingers underneath roll em out it's straight territory and don't worry you can always kind of tighten them up a little bit when they're on the tray nice and gently so then the last thing to do to have a guess before they go into the oven is we need to score them again a lot of people when just kind of scoring baguette because of the way it looks as it's finished their tendencies cut straight across the dough what we're looking for is almost straight lines each one just offsets the next it's gonna look like an ear of wheat and then the next one starts just behind basically aim to do a straight line because you won't do a straight line you know doing a crooked annoys and you'll get the exact angle that we want again nice and quick it's incompetent so when we're cutting our dogs or we're screwing our breads we use a razor blade as opposed to say using their life because it's just razor sharp cuts cleanly and when your users things most important to remember it's not a bread knife you have to be nice and confident and you need to slash nice quick compliments and it works absolutely great so our breads are ready to load into Robin its preheated to 240 degrees now we're very lucky with these ovens are actually fitted with steams that actually release steam into our oven because the idea being for the first about 10 minutes of your bake you dough is still rising within the oven and if you have a really dry heat what often happens is the cross tends to form but the dough has to finish rise and so wants to rise but I can't break through the surface so it'll often happen is you'll tend to find that the crust feels over stops the dough from rising so you don't get the same you could have got steamed is quite important if your others are fitted with steamed pan you're not lucky enough to have that simply just a roasting tray preheated into the base of the oven and he cans pour in a boiling kettle or a splash of hot water but you release a blast of steam into your oven so we're straight in [Music] and they're gonna bake for about 20 minutes because we only about 250 grams I said I'm gonna bake it high and fast now a baguette had their full break so you can Peter they'll be light beautiful crisp lovely rustic baguettes and you can actually you can actually hear them sing just as you come out of the oven you're hearing on crack you're in a break so three days in the making I know it seems like a lot but believe me that's what every a little bit all out there it's favor use the thin crisp crust give this recipe a try promise you won't be disappointed [Music] you", "ffgZP-ZKKtI": "Claudia Romeo: Baguettes. Can you name a more\nquintessential French food? The recipe is quite simple. You just need flour,\nwater, yeast, and salt. Yet, here in France, it's\nnot just any loaf of bread that anybody can make at home. We're in Paris in the 14th district, and we're about to meet\nwith Mahmoud M'seddi. He's an artisanal baker, son of a baker, who's been making bread basically ever since he can remember. This is his shop. Let's walk in. [bread crackling]\nMahmoud is a master of bread. Look at this giant loaf! He even won an award for\nthe best baguette in Paris. What he's going to show us\nis not your average baguette, but the baguette tradition, which is a baguette made\non-site with simple ingredients. Claudia: Making a baguette\nis much more complex and time consuming than you'd think. Every step requires inside\nknowledge, skill, and expertise. It all starts with the dough. Mahmoud starts making the dough at 5 a.m. with only flour and water, kneads it, then at 8 a.m. he adds yeast\nand salt and water again. Claudia: You can hear\nthe sounds of the dough. [dough squelching] Claudia: When the dough is\nready, it rests for one hour. Then it is taken out in small batches. Claudia: The batches of dough will be left to rest until the following day, while batches from the day before are going to be cut in pieces and shaped. This is when the dough starts\nto resemble a baguette. Claudia: One batch of dough\nwill make about 20 baguettes, and about 200 baguettes will come out from the whole of the dough. [crunching] Wow. It smells so nice. So soft inside.", "efqe9Umxopc": "how do you tell a good Reddy's without testing now this man only quit red Sun this way the only way Colette's entered herself this is what great bread sounds like today we're making sandwich size of baguettes for a separate bond me video that I'm going to be doing but whatever you do with these these are going to make some of the best sandwiches of your life so the recipe is going to start right here but as always I want to cover a couple key cooking tips and knowledge by comparing this to my focaccia recipe there about 95% similar but there's a couple of key differences that we're going to cover also yes I like adding unnecessary affects the interest of these videos so my focaccia recipe and this baguette recipe are both 75% hydration dose which yields a thin crispy crust and an airy but even crumb the only difference in ingredients is there's no olive oil in the baguette recipe no olive oil just leads to a slightly different texture on the interior and different brownie on the outside besides the olive oil the recipe is the exact same up until shaping obviously focaccia is baked in a large pan but baguettes are usually in a tapered cylinder now shaping is probably the trickiest part to get down for first-timers but I'll show you guys how to do it no problem after shaping we need to score the dough which is absolutely critical those slashes you see on the dough aren't for decoration though they do look pretty good instead these slashes provide a vent for guests to escape while it's baking so our loaf opens up this is known as oven spring without scoring the gas will look for the weakest spot to escape which could be out the side or the bottom with scoring we're able to control where those gases are going to escape lastly we need steam while baking the baguettes this is critical to because the steam on the crust will help keep the dough soft allowing the yeast to expel more gas in the oven so the loaf is gonna spring open more additionally that steam will help start to coagulate on the surface giving us a nice shiny and brown crust so with all these bread videos hopefully you guys are starting to see the similarities and differences between various bread products I mean predominantly it's all the same process but there's just kind of subtle changes here in there that are gonna lead to a different baked product but anyway let's make these and I can't wait to make a bonhomie out of these start by pouring 375 milliliters of 100 degree water into a bowl to that we're going to add 5 grams of instant yeast along with a spoonful of flour and stir that until it is dissolved you're gonna let this mixture stand for 5 to 10 minutes until a light foam surfaces and little balls are visible this is proofing and it is done to test the viability of the yeast if there is no foam surface or little bubbles the yeast is likely dead and should be discarded for new yeast or else we won't get a rise in our baguettes meanwhile add 500 grams of all-purpose or bread flour and 10 grams of salt to a large mixing bowl once the yeast is proofed pour in the mixture and vigorously mix the dough with your hands until no dry flour remains in the bolt and a cohesive mass forms probably about 1 to 2 minutes the dough will be very sticky at this point so cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes resting will allow the flour to start hydrating all on its own and make the dough a little bit easier to work with when we start stretching and folding once rested grab a little bowl with water and dip your hands into it to help prevent sticking you're gonna perform a stretch and fold by grabbing a corner of the dough in the bowl lift straight up to stretch the dough as high as it will go without tearing and then fold it over to the other side you're gonna rotate the bulb and perform three more reps of stretch in folds once you have done four folds you're gonna turn the dough over onto itself covered again with plastic wrap and let it rest another 25 to 30 minutes this is one set of a stretching fold and you're gonna perform three more sets with 25 to 30 minutes of rest in between for each set of stretching folds the dough should feel more elastic and stretched further without tearing and it will start to capture some air bubbles on the outside the stretch and fold method is better suited than kneading for a high hydration dough like this because the dough is naturally sticky and this method reduces hand contact additionally the stretching fold will allow for a more open crumb when baked because we aren't pushing the air out of the dough we're just lightly stretching it up and folding it over after the fourth and final set of stretching folds you want to test for gluten development by cutting off a little piece of the dough and stretching it very thin to see if you can get a gluten window that is slightly transparent this gluten window test is the key to understanding if the flour has been hydrated enough meaning our gluten is developed if the dough tears before getting to a slightly translucent window let it rest for another 25 minutes and perform another set of stretching folds after the fourth and final set of stretching folds sprinkle a little bit of flour over your work surface now using a bench scraper we're gonna divide the dough into 6 equal portions roughly a hundred and forty-five grams each this is going to give us a nice sandwich sized baguette once portioned using your fingertips lightly press and stretch each piece of dough into a rough rectangle shape about five inches wide and a note on the flower try to use as little as possible just enough to be able to shape it and it's not overly sticking to your hands definitely don't overdo that flower though once everything is portioned and in a rough rectangle shape cover the dough pieces with a clean towel and let these rest for 15 minutes once the portions arrested spray some baking spray on your hand the dough and the work surface to help prevent sticking now take a rectangle of the dough and work it into a more even shape rectangle that we will fold into a baguette you're gonna fold the top edge of the dough down to the center pressing lightly to tighten the dough and form an edge now fold the dough in half again down to the bottom to form a seam you're gonna use the heel of your hand or your fingertips and lightly press that to seal the seam of the dough at the bottom at this point you should have a log of dough seal side down all you have to do for the tapered ends is place your hands on the outside edges of the dough and roll with a little bit of pressure this is what is going to give us that signature baguette shape I'll show you guys a shot of the process from my POV as well as before start with the dough in a rough rectangle and fold it to the center of the dough using your fingertips gently press the seam of the dough together and now fold again to the bottom of the dough and seal that seam with your fingertips or the heel of your hand for the tapered ends apply even pressure on both sides and roll the dough with your hands the key is to not overwork the dough here we want to maintain that airiness in our baguette and use that baking spray as needed to avoid sticking repeat this process with each baguette and place on a baking sheet sized piece of parchment paper I use two pieces of parchment paper three baguettes on each now cover the baguettes with a towel and let them proof until the I get sore about one and a half times in size this will probably take 45 to 60 minutes with 15 minutes of proofing left preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit on the convection setting 475 if you don't have convection now fill a baking pan halfway with water and place it on the bottom rack of the oven and place a metal baking sheet on the middle rack this pan of water will help create a steamy environment for that crisper crust and the baking sheet will be preheated so the baguettes can be slid on with the parchment paper and immediately start baking for a faster oven spring with the baguettes proofed and the oven setup we need to score each baguette with one long slash at a 45 degree angle to allow for the oven spring but before we do that here is the saddest thing that has ever happened to me while baking bread this small cutting board fell out of the overhead cabinet and absolutely flattened two of my precious proved loaves I was a little pissed off not gonna lie I ended up having to reshape and let them proof for another 45 minutes anyway let's get back to scoring for scoring I'm using a bread lame which is just a fancy way to hold a razor you could absolutely do the same thing with a sharp knife slice in about 1/2 inch into the dough in one long stroke now you could also do some small slashes if you like for a slightly different look once scored pull the preheated baking sheet out of the oven and slide the parchment paper with that baguettes onto it now to spritz them with a spray bottle of warm water this water is gonna sit on the surface of the crust before steaming which will help us with that shiny crisp crust now add the pan to the middle rack of your preheated oven and set a timer to bake for 5 minutes after 5 minutes you can open it up and we're gonna spritz these baguettes one more time you should be able to see some nice oven spring when you open up the dough after 5 minutes now continue baking the baguettes for another 12 to 15 minutes until the crust is nice and golden brown crispy and the bread sounds hollow when it is thump take the baguettes out of the oven and place them on a wire rack to completely cool before slicing in and enjoying and just listen to that sweet sweet sound once we slice in you can see that beautifully thin but crisp crust with a nice open interior of the crumb the texture is absolutely to die for as always the full recipe will be up on my website which would be linked below so you guys can make these for yourself and like I said anything you put in these is gonna be absolutely delicious for me I am making that bond me so the only goal that I have for the next 24 hours is to not finish these at least save one for the video tomorrow but that's gonna wrap it up for me hopefully you guys enjoyed if you're new definitely drop me a like and subscribe I'll catch you in the next one peace you you", "vWdjqdmFHxw": "(upbeat music) - This is the best damn sandwich I ever ate. It's a baguette with brie and butter. I had four of these damn things every day I was there. You got to try this. Here, go ahead. Eat it, go ahead. Go ahead. - Whoa, yeah. - [Andrew] Hey, what's up guys. Welcome back to Binging with Babish. For this week, we're taking a look at the butter and brie\nbaguettes from \"Twin Peaks\". As you can see, I've already got some nice\nbrie and some nice butter. So, there's only one thing missing. Some bakery fresh Persian baguettes. Which we're going to make by starting with an overnight poolish. Which is a very fun word used\nto describe a quick preferment that improves both texture and flavor. We're simply mixing together\n120 grams of bread flour, a little tiny pinch of instant yeast, and half a cup, or 118 grams, cool water. Tiny whisk until no dry flour remains. And you're left with a\nsufficiently gooey goo. Cover, and let it sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours, up to 18. When you return, it should\nlook very much the same, but, upon removing the lid and plunging your fingers into it, you will find it has transformed into a nice fermented\nsmelling, very sticky, ectoplasmic goop. Which we are now going to\nadd to the final bread batch. 420 grams of bread flour, four and a half grams, or one and a half\nteaspoons, instant yeast, and tiny whisk in order to\nprotect the yeast from the salt. 12 grams, or two teaspoons,\nworth of kosher salt. And a little more than\na cup, or 255 grams, of lukewarm water, along with our starter. Mixed together with a rubber\nspatula until just combined. And then it's time to start\ngetting your hands dirty. Because we are kneading\nthis dough by hand. Once a shaggy dough forms, turn it out onto an unflour-ed work\nsurface, and get to kneading. Now, this is a pretty high\nhydration dough, about 68%. So, it's going to be very, very sticky. Which, if you are a decidedly\nunprofessional baker, like me, is going to be\nvery, very hard to knead. So, we're going to resort to\nthe good old slap-and-fold. Basically, just pick the dough up, slap it down on the table,\nand fold it over itself. Repeating for anywhere\nfrom eight to 15 minutes, depending on your forearm strength. If you need a break from this\nrepetitive and violent act, you can stop and do a\nlittle traditional kneading. No matter how you do it, the end game here is gluten formation. Either way, all you're really doing is stretching the dough out, and folding it over on itself, until the dough is soft and elastic, and passes the window pane test. Indicating that you have a strong and well-developed gluten network, ready for a one and one\nhalf hour long bulk ferment. That is the act of letting\nthe unshaped dough rise, covered at room temperature\nfor an hour and a half. But, we're going to cheat, and strengthen our dough's gluten network by doing a couple lift-and-folds. Halfway through the bulk ferment, we're going to lift\nthe dough from the edge and fold it into the center, five or six times, rotating as we go. This is going to help compensate for our lack of experience\nand upper body strength. After another 45 minutes, we ought to see some good bubble action. And it will be time to\ndivide and shape the dough on a lightly oiled work surface. I'm dividing this dough to four parts, which is going to make for\nsome pretty small baguettes. Something that, at the\ntime, I didn't know. So, we're going to pretend that\nthis is our practice round, as we shape these pieces into balls, stretching and tucking\nthe dough under itself until the top is taut. Covering and letting rest for 15 minutes, so the gluten relaxes, and then beginning the\nbaguette shaping process. First with patting the whole thing out into a rough rectangle. No particular size, just as\nrectangle-y as you can get it. Then starting, with the\nside closest to you, we're going to fold in towards the center. Repeating with the\nother side of the dough, and pressing vigorously to seal. Then we're repeating this action, but just one little bit at a time, pressing down with the heel of our hand, making sure that the\nseam is tightly sealed. You should also hear lots\nof air bubbles poof-ing out, like miniature farts. With that done, we're\ngoing to start pressing and rolling out from the center, increasing the pressure as we get towards the\noutside of the dough, so as to taper the ends, forming the dough into something sort of\nresembling a baguette. Which, I'm going to try\nbaking two different ways. First, in a baguette loaf pan, which is a sort of trench shaped pan, filled with lots and lots of little holes. We're to place this\ninside of a proofing bag, and inflate it, like a\nchild's birthday balloon. And let it rise for about 45 minutes. The other two, we're going\nto do the traditional way, in what the French call a couche. Which, is basically\njust a large linen cloth that we're going to heavily\nflour and fold into trenches, in which our loaves can rise\nunder a lightly dampened cloth. Again, for about 45 minutes. Once everybody's just\nabout doubled in size, it's time to score. Which, ideally you want to do with a bread lame or razor blade, but, we're just going to do\nwith the sharpest knife we got. Five long diagonal slashes, the ends of which should overlap. The other two loaves I'm placing on a well flour-ed pizza peel, because they're headed onto a pizza stone. 450 Fahrenheit for anywhere\nfrom 17 to 20 minutes. As you can see, the loaves from the specialized\nbaguette pan look nice and evenly brown. We want an internal temp between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit and a deep brown crust. And as you can see, my scores\nwere not nearly deep enough, which resulted in some blowouts\non the side of the loaf. But, this is still some\nreally gorgeous bread. A shatteringly crisp crust\nand a chewy open crumb, and a nice complex flavor\nfrom the overnight ferment. They say that eating bread\nstill hot out of the oven will give you a stomach ache, and I could not give less of a (bleep). Now our pizza stone loaves\nare headed out of the oven, and they kind of look a\nlittle bit nicer to me. A little lighter on the bottom, a little darker on the top, and as you can see, I did a\nslightly better job of scoring. It's still not good enough. So, we're starting again, this time using a stand\nmixer for obvious reasons. Everything the same, except I'm upping the\nsecondary water to 270 grams, giving the dough a hydration of 72%. And this time, for more robust baguettes, I'm dividing the dough in half instead of quarters. Rolling out and shaping, proofing in my couche, this time for a full hour to make sure that\nthey're not under-proved. And just for another experiment, I'm baking one on a rim baking sheet and the other on the pizza stone. And both are being sprayed generously with water before going into the oven. Does this comply with\nthe scientific method? No, not at all. But the pizza stone method\nprevailed once again. And the spritzing of water gave us an incredibly crackly crust. They say that you can hear good breads. So, let's listen in. (bread crunching) Now that's the kind of crust I'd want to demolish the roof of my mouth when I eat this sandwich. First, we're going to cut\nit in half length-wise, and inspect our nice,\nirregular, air-y crumb. And then, this sandwich\nonly has three ingredients. Read, the absolute best\nhigh quality French butter that you can get your hands on, which we're going to slather\non both sides of the bread, and lightly salt if\nyour butter is unsalted. And lastly, a generous\nstack of sliced French brie. Remember that when\nyou're following a recipe as simple as this one, you want the absolute best ingredients that you can get your hands on. Top it up, and that's it. All there\nis left to do is consume it with all the slime-ball energy\nof a \"Benjamin Horne\" type. First, we're going to give\nit an uncomfortable sniff, and tear into it from the side, like some kind of animal. And, I'm going to speak to you honestly, from the heart right now, this was genuinely one\nof the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Rich, creamy butter and brie, tucked into a flavorful,\nchewy, crispy baguette, still warm out the oven. It seriously makes you want\nto eat it like a sociopath. And, as you can see from my body language, I like it. But, this is \"Binging with Babish\", and we're not letting a sandwich go by without a cross section. Even if it's kind of lame looking. It doesn't taste lame\nlooking (muffled speaking). (upbeat music)", "Q2rLPq8oYCc": "[Music] hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with how to make perfect French baguette at home that's right I've gotten so many food wishes for this over the years and I would always reply to the person you know what you really can't make great French baguette at home and I would list all the reasons like the flour in the water and the steam injected oven but that was before I actually tried it but once I did I realized I was wrong again so I'm gonna show you how to make Parisian Bakery quality baguette in your very own home and I think you're gonna be fairly shocked at just how simple this is so we're gonna start with our French bread dough we're gonna use our famous no-knead method which means we're gonna start off with a very small amount of yeast that's just a quarter teaspoon we're gonna throw that in a mixing bowl along with some room-temperature water we don't need warm water for this I'm gonna give that a little stir but we don't need to let this sit like we usually do we don't need this or even want this to start rising quickly so quick stir I'm also gonna add in some salt and then of course the last ingredient flour and I'm not even using bread flour fists we're just gonna use regular all-purpose flour and we're gonna dump that in and we're gonna take a wooden spoon and we're gonna mix that up and at first you're gonna think wow this is way too wet and then as you continue stirring you're gonna thank man this is way too dry but then that'll pass and you'll realize this is gonna be perfect and as you keep stirring and stirring you're gonna get a super thick super sticky dough that will eventually pull all the flour away from the sides okay so just use your wooden spoon to work that lump of dough against the sides of the bowl and if you measure all the ingredients by weight which I'm gonna insist you do that's exactly what it should look like alright very moist very very very sticky but again it does come together enough to pull away from the sides of the bowl that's kind of important alright once we get to that stage we're gonna stop and then we'll simply wrap this in plastic throw a towel over it that really is mostly for looks and I'm gonna put that inside a turned off oven for 12 to 14 hours or until it doubles in size and if it happens a little sooner that's fine if it takes a little longer that's fine but basically it should resemble this this is what mine look like after 12 hours and then we're gonna take a spatula and kind of knock the air out of this you can see just how sticky and wet and elastic that is I probably should have floured the spatula but it's too late but basically we're just going to knock the air out of that dough by scraping it out and we're gonna do so on to a very well floured work surface so sprinkle a good amount of flour down first we're also gonna want to dust them over the top as well as have our hands very well floured and I keep stressing it but this dough is very sticky and has to stay that way so I just want you to use the minimum amount of flour you need to work with this and all we're gonna do is Pat that down into a rectangle all right the primary reason is to knock all the air out but it also will give us a shape that we can cut into four relatively even sized pieces and of course you could weigh these and get them perfectly even but I can't even pretend to care about stuff like that you think I'm scared of baguettes that aren't all the same size I don't think so so we're gonna divide that up into four pieces to make our loaves but before we start shaping that let's make sure we have our pan ready so I have a half sheet pan with a baking mat on it then I'm gonna dust with the cornmeal so that's prepped and ready for our loaves so let's get shaping and that is going to be extremely easy because all we're gonna do is take one of those pieces of dough and we'll give it a little dusting of flour again we're using the minimum we can get away with and I'm basically just gonna roll it up like that and then I'm simply gonna roll it with my fingers like this starting in the center and kind of rolling and stretching it out towards the ends and in just a few short seconds you're gonna have something that looks like that and that's really all it's necessary now if you have any obvious seams put those underneath but even that's not a big deal because once this Rises it's gonna look awesome and once our dough has been rolled out into a cylinder or something like that we're gonna transfer that onto our baking sheet and if you need to even it out a little bit you can do that here but don't worry too much about it like I said when this rises it's gonna look amazing Plus that a little bit of texture on the surface and those slight inconsistencies in the girth are all gonna add to that authentic French baguette appearance and once those are panned up one little quick optional step I do like to take a damp piece of paper towel and just kind of wipe off the excess cornmeal this is gonna go in a super hot oven like five fifty and that extra stuff could smoke in the oven and then we're gonna give the tops our loaves a generous dusting of flour and then very very very lightly drape this with plastic wrap and then once those are covered we're gonna let those rise for about an hour to an hour and a half or until just about doubled in size and I will admit halfway through I got totally paranoid my plastic was gonna stick so I decided to dust it very generously with flour and I put that back on there and I felt better so once you just flour your plastic wrap begin with but bottom line we're gonna leave those loaves to rise and this is what mine look like when they were done it was kind of chilly in my kitchen that day so this took about an hour and a half oh by the way you've probably noticed I'm just doing two loaves here this recipe makes four small baguettes or two regular-sized ones but since we're mostly this will be the largest pan you can get ahold of we're gonna do it this way so I'm gonna cook two I'll cook the other two later and at this point we are finally ready to bake so we're gonna preheat our oven to 550 or as high as your oven will go and we're also on the bottom rack gonna put a pan of water that's gonna keep the oven nice and humidified which is going to be critical to get that authentic crust so our oven is preheating and it's on to the last official step we have to take a razor and make some slashes in the dough but we're not gonna use a razor we're gonna use scissors it's so much easier so take some scissors hold them straight up and make a 45-degree cut but the only problem with the scissor method is it does leave these little sharp tips which you got to poke down I mean that's one of the first things you learn in bag at school if you're gonna snip you gotta tuck the tip alright so remember that so we're gonna poke those down and I said that was the last step but really this is the last official step before these go in the oven we got to take a spray bottle and we got to give these a nice miss teen make sure the surface of both loaves are covered and by the way keep that spray bottle close to you we're gonna use that again at that point we're gonna place it in our preheated oven and we're gonna bake that at 550 degrees for about 15 minutes or until done but don't go anywhere we got stuff to do after five minutes of baking I want you to quickly open up the oven door and give both loaves a really quick spray quickly close the door back up so that's the first spray about four or five minutes in and then we're gonna do one more spray after about ten minutes and while we do this second spray we're also gonna give the pan a turn just so it cooks nice and evenly and by the way at this point do not worry if it looks ugly it's gonna look a little spotty do not be scared because like four or five minutes later when you pull these out after about 50 minutes total cooking time you're gonna be looking at a couple incredibly gorgeous and absolutely authentic French baguettes and I check those out and I know those look so trade magnifique you want to eat it right away but you can't you have to let this cool put them on a rack until they completely cool do not cut these do not cut these warm but after they're cooled down you're gonna take a serrated knife and you're gonna hear something that sounds like this oh yeah in fact they can say you can tell how good a bag that's gonna taste by the sound I totally agree with that and this did not disappoint it just came out absolutely perfect that thin crispy crusty exterior and the insides very tender very light while at the same time they have that signature chewiness that the baguettes are known for and of course the only way to make this any better or any more French would be to put some butter on it so we're gonna burn that up and continue to enjoy what is truly one of the world's great pleasures in fact this came out so good I'd like to apologize to all the French bakeries we're gonna put out a business when this goes viral sorry guys but you had a good run so I really do hope you give this a try head over to food wishes com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy [Music]", "fKRZOpHvcdI": "hi it's Martin dinar low and today we're filming at the King Arthur Studios no one's been here so it's safe for us to come over and do some baking and we need it because they have extra ovens and today we're going to make a pile of classic baguettes okay so let's do this and again thank you sir and again we're doing the classic baguettes these are classic French baguettes recipe is on the website so yesterday evening I started a poolish a poolish is a type of free permit if you're new to bread baking you may not have made bread with a pre firm it before there's a really good blog that I wrote on the King Arthur website about pre ferments and different types of pre ferments and why you should use them and all of those things so this is a little bit of flour and water and yeast that we mixed yesterday and you can see that you see all these bubbles in here you can tell that it's active right this is equal parts by weight flour and water so what that did overnight was the yeast begin to eat sugar which is in the flour and they produce flavor as a byproduct of that process so it's called fermentation right so we've been getting the fermentation okay so foolish in the bowl and I'm going to pour my water in water is lukewarm and I'm just gonna start a combined the recipe says put everything in the bowl and just go and that's another way to do it too but when I'm mixing by hand I have a tendency to break things up a little bit because I want to make sure that everything is homogeneous my hands in a mixer we tend to let it run for a while and it does some of the work for us but I'm being a little bit more cautious than that okay so I'm gonna put the east end and salt in salt and yeast are okay together it's a myth that they're not okay together they actually work just fine no one's gonna get hurt this dough will spend a much bunch of time with the yeast and the salt in the same place so it's okay if they begin that relationship right now it's not a big deal just mix to combine I'm using instant yeast I always use instant dry yeast it used to be that we had to sort of prove yeast or put it in water and let it begin you don't have to do that anymore it's been the processing has changed so that you don't have to do that which is nice okay I'm just stirring a baguette dough should be a soft dough it should be a pretty soft dough now what I will say about this recipe is that it is not as soft as a recipe that I might make in a bakery it's a little bit stiffer and that's okay because if you're new to baguettes and again I think I've said it many times before baguettes are not easy it's not an easy place to begin in fact if the first bread that you want to make is a baguette I would say let's wait let's let's make that you know let's hold that hold on hold off on that for just a little bit so now yet those should be a pretty soft dough but like I said this is a little bit stiffer and the reason for that is that it's a little bit easier for you to shake if you're new to the game it's a really wet dough it can be pretty challenging your shape now I gave myself a little bit of extra water because I have felt like this dough has been a little bit on the dry side and I think this one can take a little bit more water in my hands are happy shaping wetter dough so I have an additional about 40 50 grams of water that I'm gonna add all of that I think I could add all of it let's just go for it but I waited until I felt like I could kind of see where the dough was before I added that extra water in and now I'm just gonna need it in my hand this dough gets an hour and a half of full fermentation and it has one fold in the middle of that process and the folding is just like kind of like the folding is kind of like what we've done we we shape right you remember that yeah but I would say about adding the additional water it is try it as written first like really follow the instructions the first time and if you're happy with the resulting you don't need to do anything if you feel like the structure is a little bit tighter than what you want then I would say maybe add a little bit of water the next time if you're a musician you may know what tabular curious or even just musical notation a recipe is like musical notation in a way in that it's notes on the page and the notes on the page will get you close to the song but they're not the song they're not the song it takes time it takes practice to get to where you can interpret things and become a good musician a good singer a good banjo player or a good bread maker so it takes time in repetitions okay so this down is together and what I would say is go ahead and scrape your bowl down and then set a 45 minute timer and leave it covered do your fold at 45 minutes and then at an hour and a half or if it feels a little sluggish or it's a little cool in your house then maybe it two hours go ahead and go to your divide we're gonna clean up here and then I think we're ready to move to the next step yeah okay so I'm gonna start this divide and we already have some which are divided and Arlo is just rounding those up yeah yeah that looks really good so Arlo is taking a divided piece of dough and he's just folding the corners to the center and that's about it you don't have to do more than that that's perfect you don't even need to round it no that's good that's good you're just gonna sort of gather it and bring it together and then put it seem down yeah seam down on a floured surface and you keep going with that and I'm gonna start with this one the recipe on the website for the classic baguettes makes three and I have done I've done a fair amount more than that I've been a couple double batches so I should be able to get about six out of this these are scaled and about right around 300 grams so we're gonna get these divided and then we will come back for shaping so we have these divided and now we're going to let them relax for I'm guessing this is going to take about 20 minutes to get to a place where we can shape it so we're gonna let them relax make sure that you cover them if your room is particularly dry you're gonna want more than just a towel or something on top you're gonna want a piece of plastic or something which prevents the skin from drying if the skin dries you will have problems when you go to shave so protect those baguettes okay so this dough has had 15 20 25 minutes I don't know somewhere in there to relax and it's starting to feel like we could shape it if you pick a piece up and it doesn't sort of easily and actually these might just be just a Titch young but it's okay we're gonna make them work if they feel tight and you can't stretch them in just your hands right here then you're probably gonna have a hard time shaping of them so anyway I think these are pretty close and let me see how they feel this is our linen let me fix this real quickly I'm gonna put a little bit of flour down before I go to shave thanks buddy put a little bit of flour down and smooth it out this is linen this type of linen is very good as well this is a flax linen you can also use somewhere around here you can also use a dish towel as long as it's a pretty tight weave it will be okay the nice thing about canvas or flax linen is that it has some rigidity to it and so when you go to load it makes it a little bit easier it also makes it so the dough doesn't stick quite as easily so I recommend linen I recommend flex slim it's like the industry standard okay I'm gonna shape a couple here and then I'll have anthem come around and have her shoot over my shoulder so that if you so that you don't have to look at this upside down okay so if you've watched our videos you might have seen the shaping video we did a video where I cover baguettes shaping but I'm gonna do it again today just to sort of helping people out I start with a letter I go half way down and then I come all the way to the leading edge and seal and press to seal now I go back and forth to get down to about the diameter that I want and then I elongate how much do i elongate good question martins this piece of parchment right here is exactly the length of my baking stone look 18 inches I keep this piece of parchment on the bench I can use that as a guide I can use that as a guide and it just so happens that that's the same as this is that 18 inches yes and it's the same width as this baking tray as well so I have a couple things to help me the right length I roll it through a little bit of flour that helps keep it from sticking as well and then I put it on to my baking tray and make a little pleat or I sort of gather some material in between then I go and do another one we do one more and then I'll have anthem come around and then I'm gonna have you show you some - okay you shaped some baguettes but all of us all of us could use practice all of us including myself so I'm basically making a letter and I like to have sort of straight ish edges and make a little divot in the middle come down once and then I come all the way to the leading edge you can do that a couple of different ways you can use your hands sort of working with paddles or you can come and you can use your hand to seal like that so then back and forth to the diameter that I want and I taper the ends go through the flower and then I put it over here and you'll notice that whenever I put it over here I always place it seam up it should be seam up all right come around here so let's see this again I pad it a little bit I fold it in thirds like a letter I want it to be straight as best as I can come down halfway and then I come all the way to the leading edge and press to seal go to the middle back and forth to about the diameter that I want and then I go to hands and I roll to the edges and as I get to the points I just apply a little bit extra pressure so that I get some taper in the flour over to the linen or what we call Koosh and I gather where is she yeah okay okay you want to do one side by side with me sure just do that by side okay so we'll do flour there you don't need much flour if I'm gonna flour the surface I like it to be near but not in where I'm shaking so I like to be near my shaking surface not in my shaking service and give it a little bit of an east/west type so it's a nice pesto side by side that's perfect yep perfect now Pat it again now down just a little bit yeah and seal with hands like paddles perfect and then turn around very good and see bring it just a little bit down that's very good hands on the paddle and hands like paddles and seal press it up to make sure you're not stuck to the bench does it feel like you're stuck at all or no feels pretty good yeah okay so then with like the karate chop boom boom boom boom in the middle like that now hold it just down a little bit like as little as you can yeah perfect perfect yep perfect and now see if you can come all the way to the leading edge like that looks better than mine so far I love it okay is it sealed okay yeah that's good now yep no this is where it may feel a little bit funny but what you're gonna do is with your right hand since you're right-handed make a cup like this and what you want to try and do this keep the palm of your hand and your fingers on the bench and listen for the sound yup like that very good yep and it's okay to let it go kind of back and forth a little bit like you don't want to just kind of like stay in one spot you want it to travel so let me see where you are there a little bit more yeah a little bit more of a divot in the middle yeah let me see yeah that looks good now in with two hands watch this and with two hands and just so don't be asked to start here and what you want to do is when you go in right here don't let that dough get past your hand as you slide to the outside don't let that big lumpy part get past you so look what I do here I'm not gonna let that dough get past me I'm like rolling it out of the way a little bit does that make sense it's good it's good so if you find yourself in this place where you've got a little bit of them up just go back in the middle and don't let that thing get past your hand don't let your hand like just roll over it you've got to kind of push it out of the way yep like that keep that people kept on the bench yep yep keep that palm on the bench back and forth yep that's good to go one more time and make it and give it a little bit more travel there you go yeah like that like that it's okay it's okay it's really good now when you get out to the ends match it a little bit just match the tips just a little bit so that they point dude this is really good do you see that bubble right there it's like that's okay get out of the way now this is gonna be a good baguette I promise you and listen how many baguettes have you roll something like that it takes a long time to get to where you can roll that gets beautifully and evenly and it's the kind of thing that I have to practice everybody has to practice and with time it gets it gets easier but it takes time I have said it before and I'll say it again I always joke that the baguette is like you know it's like a figure-skating move make sure your fuchsias floured okay so we're going to shake a few more of these and then you can just keep on filming get it together east-west a little bit for it and we'll pick it up make sure that it's really square so if you're sticking a little bit yeah this one looks a little bit skinny this way right yeah so what you can do is you could actually take that and you can go all the way to the leading edge with it and just be done let's skip that intermediate yeah so give yourself that did it there you go there you go yeah yeah plus two steel very good now before you go let's see here for a second so you're really close okay now you're ready just how you're ready to do it look how even it is see how beautifully even it is into end yeah you know that if you start there you're gonna have a good back out okay that's good now both hands good good good good that's good and you can still see the scene right yeah that's right right here yeah there we go oh thank you these last two one fight over it viciously shaping becomes fun in the beginning it can be a little bit stressful and I I remember that but with experience it gives to where you get to where it's fun if you get a little bit of dough on your counter make sure you clean that because dough will stick to dough dough will stick to your baguette so if you have some no there so go have just as little as you can on us that's too much yeah that's good now to the leading edge now I move kind of quickly but don't feel like you have to move at that pace you just move the pace which feels comfortable to you yeah good now when you go to the site this time don't let that doe sneak out you know don't let that dose sneak past your hands you maintain your wall there yeah and it's gonna help flattening and spread the dough yep I mean hands a little bit powdery or I mean a little bit sticky just rub them on the for a second there you go good good good that just tapered a little bit there you go if it gets stuck if you feel like it's getting stuck a little bit just come over here this is gonna be a good bag you may think like us isn't it like exactly what I want it's okay I shape a lot I've shaped a lot more about what I want than you ever will unless you get started pretty soon okay so we're gonna let these proof and then we'll come back and make them so you want to start straight from the bench down and I'll put these in a place where we can free from something okay okay so I think that we are ready to load pubs are hot I tested backups in here the other day and I ran the oven at 525 which is pretty hot I think that might even be higher than what the recipe says but it's the temperature that I needed in order to get these up to where I felt like we were gonna get a nice oven spring from the back I have a baking stone then I had baking steel I have a cast iron pan which is empty preheating in the bottom of the stove can you bake baguettes on a baguette screen yes can you bake them on a sheet tray yes can you make them without steam yes but each one of those things has an effect on the bread right so if you make them in a steamy environment they can rise more fully because the crust stays nice and moist and allows it to expand if you bake them on a stone or a steel those hold heat very well and they push a lot of heat into the into the bread when you loaded it and so it expands well if you just put them on a sheet tray and put them in there they don't expand as well if you them in an oven without steam the crust dries and sets and they don't expand as well and so I'm doing everything I can to sort of emulate a baker a bakery masonry oven okay so I have parchment I'm gonna load these onto parchment then and slide them in I think that it's a little bit easier and I think that you at home will have an easier time with that so that's the way that I'm going to show you so the baguettes are proofing here let me show you like these are pretty well proofed if you can look and see they feel very marshmallowy to me so I think they're ready to go this was the first one that we shaped and so that's the first one that I'm going to load they are rising seam up the seam will be the bottom of the loaf so I need to I need to invert them so that's gonna be the top side of the load and then I just pop them on here and this is like your last chance to edit it also if there is anything that you want to change about the shape I look at them as I transfer them and I just make sure that they're nice and straight and they look good right yeah feel it although feel it and tell me what you think it feels like it's kind of puffy right yeah feels puppy I should say it just doesn't aside one note about these this recipe uses poolish but I will tell you that I set one poolish so half of these are foolish baguettes in the other half I seeded with a little bit of sourdough culture and so the other half are a more like sourdough or Levant flavoured again so that's up on that so I have enough room to bake 6 baguettes per oven we're in the studio today because no one's here and it's quiet and I wanted to be able to show you more than just a couple of I guess which is all my oven could handle I know right I think actually the new shape that which is pretty awesome okay so now it's time for for what we call scoring and we could spend a day talking about this I'll try and talk you through the broad details so the reason that we score is not only because it's pretty it's functional first and foremost scoring is functionally cutting the loaf tells it where to expand it tells it where to expand and it helps it expand more fully in the oven okay so that's why we're scoring so first and foremost you need to score well in order to make the most delicious bread because as the bread Rises it'll have a more open crumb structure with a better score now Baggett's are traditionally cut with five to seven slashes or scores what I like in the home oven is to do a single cut and so let me just do one and stop talking so come in your anthem maybe I'll talk for just another second sorry do you see how my fingers are almost drawing a channel down the middle on the highest part of this baguette do you see that that's basically where I want my cuts to land so I'm gonna start at one end and I'm gonna go to the other end I'm gonna start at one end and I'm gonna go to the other end like that if you go slowly you'll see some blade drag and I'm going slowly to try and show you but I but I should be going more quickly there are a lot of different lumps that you can use these are pretty good but once the blade is dull most of them you can't change the blade and then you just have to throw it away so I like this type a piece of metal with a blade that you can refill and then you only have to replace the blade okay so do you want to score sure okay so do you have a preference on Witchblade no okay so I want you to hold it like this like that and I want you to see if you can land it right in there and you can use your blade angle just you can go down just a little bit with your blade angle does that make sense and you're just cutting with the nicked corner of that blade you're just cutting with the corner of that blade and be careful because this will cut you okay and go down just a little bit you want to almost like get underneath just a little bit like that yep [Music] what dude that was amazing look perfect yeah really good really really good okay do another one and same thing just cutting with the tip of the blade and you can cut even a little bit deeper than that one yeah good perfect great when do the last one sure really good Wow okay and make sure you go right off the end mat right not the end listen blade angle there's a lot to talk about here blade angle is important the most important thing though is that your oven has good steam if your oven doesn't have good steam they won't open and it doesn't matter how you score so make sure you're baking with steam first and foremost we already have that discussion and then make sure that your cuts are good this might need to be just a little bit deeper so I'm just gonna hit it again just to make sure I think we're good okay so now I'm gonna load okay I made a little pizza what I did was I just took one of the baguettes and I just mashed the middle of it I didn't touch the sides but I just smashed the middle of it put a little bit of sauce cheese fresh parsley mozzarella and then a little bit of herbs in there I can tell which ones you shaped but just barely I tell you what I'm pretty impressed you come work for me in a bakery yeah takes times where you get there okay do you want to score yours I know that one's yours why don't you do that one straight give it a straight cut see if you can get the blade so right now you have it straight up and down and that's fine for some lows if if you can turn it just a little bit it'll be even better but the main thing is like try and get it into end and then if you can turn it some that'd be cool too yeah very good what I mean by turn it is and you could be just a little bit deeper just a little bit deeper so what I mean by turn it is instead of being straight up and down you get at an angle so like this see I'm like see I'm kind of like cutting it at an angle a little bit do you want me to score one with more than one on a more like yet we would in the bakery so I'll do let's try five one two three four fine let's do this 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 and why don't you do that last one straight be nice and strong with it fat yeah but still just use the tip there you go good now go yeah nice okay I think you did pretty well what do you think looks good all right so yeah mind the blade make sure that you always put your blade back where it goes and always in the container and keep track of it okay let's look it's a peak come here obviously not done far from done but looking pretty good yeah looking pretty good this oven tends to be very hot on the top so probably in the next couple minutes here I'm gonna shuffle them because if I don't I'm gonna end up burn on top and white on the bottom so we give them a little bit of a flip you know every oven is a relationship that you have to sort of develop there's no perfect oven there no perfect bakers so you have to sort of have this relationship where both of you get better okay okay what do you think it looks so good now we're really gonna smoke it crusty ears open nicely we've got a little snack here maybe with our baguette dough a little pizza baguette yeah so thanks for joining us today we hope that you learned something baguettes are a journey enjoy the journey eat your mistakes and we'll be back soon with another video good job thank you and really hopin Oh Oh", "bO0KVVrUj0Y": "[Music] so first up i'm making the poolish and in my bowl i've got 150 grams of room temperature water 3 grams of dried yeast and 150 grams of white flour and that's got a protein content of 13 i'm gonna mix this together with a bowl scraper you could use a spoon but the key is not to worry about getting the dough smooth at this point the thyme in the fridge is going to take care of that the measurements for this recipe are exact so i'd advise weighing in grams but for anyone who isn't familiar with this measurement i'll leave the volumes for the ingredients in the description box below now this just needs to be covered and popped in the fridge for anywhere between 12 to 18 hours the series of extended proofs we're going to give it in the fridge are going to give great color great texture and great flavor so here we are the next day and as we can see the poolish has fermented really well it's nice and bubbly and very active so now we can mix the final dough before again letting that rest in the fridge so i'm adding 220 grams of room temperature water to the bowl and that's going to help the poolish release sprinkle on 13 and a half grams of sea salt and 4 grams of dried yeast i'm going to add this to a bigger container as we need to make sure this can expand overnight in the fridge without creeping out of our bowl give this a quick mix together to disperse the salt and the yeast and then add in 380 grams of white flour again this has 13 protein content give the ingredients a good working together either in the bowl or on a work surface if it's easier the aim of the game is to incorporate the wet and the dry ingredients together cover the container and leave out at room temp for 30 minutes and my kitchen is 20 degrees celsius today that's 68 degrees fahrenheit come back and give it a quick two minute workout just to make sure there are no lumps we're not looking for a silky smooth dough here the next slow proof in the fridge is going to produce a really smooth and elastic dough so now just cover it pop it in the fridge for another 12 to 18 hours right here we are the next day and as you can see the dough has proved really well in the fridge overnight now this has come straight out from the fridge it's still cold and i'm going to tip it straight out onto the work surface then gently bring each side of the dough up and over itself and form it into a ball i actually proved a double quantity of this in the end so i could make some pizza tonight so i'll divide it into two so that i'm working with the same amount as the quantity in my recipe and if anyone would like to see the pizza recipe let me know in the comments now you should have about 900 ish grams of dough and this recipe makes four baguettes that are about 35 to 40 centimeters long weigh your dough out into four pieces which should be about 220 grams each now first we'll ball each piece up and we'll leave it to rest for a good 20 minutes covered at room temperature and this will allow the dough to relax and begin to come back to room temperature i've used a small drizzle of olive oil in each one of these baking trays just to stop the dough balls sticking working with two of the dough balls at a time will give you a little more room in your kitchen but of course if you've got the space then you could shape all four at once but just make sure they'll all fit in your oven lightly dust the work surface and shape the dough ball into a short sausage by gently rolling over the dough and pinching down the seam i'm not squeezing out the gases i'm trying to keep them encased in the dough as i roll and press repeat with both pieces and cover with a cloth and then leave for 10 minutes to rest out of room temperature the rest is really important as it will allow the dough to relax and make the next shaping process really easy and finally we'll repeat the same shaping process again making sure we seal the dough from tip to tip the dough will naturally extend while you do this and again be careful not to push out those gases now let's gently roll out the baguette to get an even size and to taper off the ends working from the center of the baguette gently roll your hands forwards and backwards and slowly extend them outwards once you reach the very end you can apply a bit more pressure and roll out the tips now baguettes are traditionally proofed on a couch a cloth used for baking but you can substitute this for a tea towel that's been well dusted with flour but here i'll show you how to proof them on baking paper i'm going to bake these on my baking steel and i've added a baking tray to the bottom of the oven and inside is a non-coated stainless steel chain this is preheated in the oven along with the baking steel for one hour at 250 degrees celsius that's 485 degrees fahrenheit i'll use the chain and baking tray combination to create steam but you could use a preheated baking tray in the bottom of the oven if you don't have a baking steel or a stone then you could proof these on a baking tray and then slide that straight into the oven to bake but i find i get a little bit better oven spring when baking on a steel or a stone now cover with a cloth and leave those baguettes to proof for about 45 minutes this will depend on the temperature of your kitchen and while these are proofing you can begin the shaping process on the last two pieces of dough test the dough by gently pushing it with your finger the baguettes are ready to bake when the dough slowly pushes back out it should feel gassy but still strong now as these haven't been proved on a floured couch i'll give the exterior a quick flour and gently brush it that'll give a really nice color contrast when baked right now it's time to score imagine two parallel lines running down the center of the baguette about one centimeter apart hold your blade at an angle and not straight this is going to help with the ear of the bread opening up now don't score an angle across the baguette score almost in a straight line working from the right side of the imaginary parallel lines to the left start the next cut just above the previous one and so on now using a peel or something flat slide the baguettes into the preheated oven give the top a quick mist and gently throw two ice cubes into the steaming tray bake for 20 minutes or until you've got a deep dark color on the outside this produces the best crust in my opinion now your other two baguettes should be shaped proofed and ready to bake [Music] so a super simple little baguette recipe really easy takes a bit of time but really really worth the effort now if you make this and you post a pick up on instagram then don't forget to drop me a tag that's it i'd like to say a huge thank you for watching i'll see you again very soon stay tuned", "BmFnJOAWvi0": "it's baguette time oh yes ladies and gentlemen today we're making crusty baguette like a baker when you baguette you don't regret i am welcome to vincenzo's play with the buckets thank you anthony silvio the fantastic baker he's been showing us so many secrets and techniques how to bake and today showing us how to bake baguettes crusty baguettes crusty baguettes the french way yeah i can't wait please show us the first step is we need to make a pre-fermented dough today the pre-fermented dough we're going to make is called poolish which means that we mix together equal quantities of flour and water with a very very very small pinch of yeast mix it together and let it ferment overnight we're going to allow this one to ferment for 12 to 18 hours depending on how warm the night is or the day is when you're making this and then tomorrow we'll come back and we'll mix that poolish into our final dough to make beautiful baguettes we have 190 grams of cold water 190 grams of bread flour and then i have here some dried yeast of which i'm only going to use a tiny pinch the first step is we need to add our little tiny pinch into the water then we can add all of our flour and we just simply mix since we're using equal quantities of flour and water you can see that this is quite a wet dough it looks almost like a paste but by the time that we let this ferment for 12 to 18 hours overnight you're going to see tomorrow this is a very active and alive bubbly mixture now we just need to cover this nice and tightly and we're going to leave it at room temperature we'll see you tomorrow it's time to mix our final dough let's have a look at the ingredients we're using we have our poolish we have 380 grams of bread flour 2 grams of dried yeast very important that the quantity of the yeast is exact we have 10 grams of sea salt and optional we have 10 grams of die static malt powder diastatic malt powder can be found online but if it's too hard to find you can just leave it out and lastly 215 grams of nice cool water firstly let's add our poolish into the water all of it into the water you can see it's nice and gassy so it's actually floating on top of the water there now it's time to add all of our yeast our malt all of the flour and lastly add your salt on top of the flour we add the salt on top of the flour so that it doesn't come in direct contact with our yeast and kill that activity now we just need to simply stir all of these ingredients together in the bowl continue stirring the ingredients together until they are all combined and the flour is nice and hydrated now that you've combined the ingredients together and all the flour is hydrated simply cover the bowl and we're going to leave this to rest just for about 15 minutes to allow that flour to continue hydrating and then we're going to get in in just a moment and start to mix it by hand this step of resting the dough is really really important and it's actually going to make kneading the dough by hand in a moment much easier for you so be patient and allow the dough to rest okay it's been 15 minutes now we're going to remove our dough from the bowl onto the bench and you can either wet your hands or use a bowl scraper if you've got one of these and we're going to take you through how to do the slap and fold method which is how we're going to knead our dough before we start to mix the dough i want to show you if i pull some of this dough out can you see how the gluten strands in the dough are a little bit uneven it's not very smooth and you can see that it's actually breaking a little bit okay this is an indication that our dough is under mixed so now we're going to mix the dough and we'll do this again at the end to show you what it's meant to look like when it's properly developed before we start mixing the dough by hand we're going to dampen them so i've wet my hands a little bit and now we're going to do the slap and fold method here's how we do it we scoop our dough off the bench and with our slightly wet hands i'm going to slap the dough forward pull at it and then fold it all the way over okay now i'm going to turn my hands this way and pick the dough up from the side and return back to the starting position again slap the dough forward pull out it a little bit and then fold it over and we're going to repeat this for the next few minutes to begin to develop the dough's gluten let's do it continue to slap and fold your dough for the next few minutes until the dough is nice and tight and it builds that beautiful gluten development now that we have been mixing the dough for a little while it's time to check its development we can perform the window pane test that we did earlier just by pulling the dough out between our fingers gently we want to see that the dough is nice and shiny and strong elastic but also extensible and can you see that you can see through there it's a very very thin film and that's a lovely window pane now that our dough is beautifully developed we're going to shape it into a nice tight ball and then we're going to pop it into our bowl to ferment for the next two hours to roll this into a nice tight ball i'm just moving my hands in this motion okay and i'm touching the ball with my right hand then my left hand then my right hand then my left hand pushing up against the dough making the skin of the dough nice and tight so we get this beautiful tight plump ball we're going to grease our bowl with a little bit of olive oil just a touch just to help the dough not to stick then we're going to grab our dough place it into the bowl cover your bowl with plastic wrap and we're going to leave this to ferment at room temperature for a good two hours and at the one hour mark we're going to uncover again and give the dough a fold on itself to reinforce the gluten structure within the dough our baguette dough has been resting for one hour so far so let's uncover it you can see it's increased in volume what we're going to do is we're going to take this dough and with a nice damp hand just gently come underneath pick it up stretch and fold it over itself turn the bowl 90 degrees again stretch fold over itself and do that twice more so you've got all the sides and nicely folded over nice and gentle you're also spreading the olive oil and that's going to make a really nice tight dough once again because as the dough rests it becomes very loose and extensible so by folding it we just reinforce the gluten development in the dough so let's cover this once again and we're going to leave that for one more hour at which point it'll be ready to divide and to shape now our dough has been fermenting at room temperature for two hours it's time to divide let's have a look at our dough looks beautiful it's increased in volume it's nice and fluffy exactly what we want okay let's pop our dough onto the bench nice and carefully beautiful now it's time to divide our dough into the smaller pieces today we're going to divide them into 200 gram pieces each at the shop typically a baguette dough would weigh 350 grams and that's because they become really nice and long but we can't fit them in our domestic ovens at home so that's why we're going to make a smaller weight and make a little bit of a shorter baguette so it can fit in everyone's oven so cut a piece of dough gently move it over to a digital scale and keep cutting until you've got 200 grams more or less place that aside so now that we have the dough divided with no flour on the bench at all okay we're going to now pre-shape the dough what we do is we grab our pieces of dough and just fold them over each other a couple of times until it becomes a little bit more plump and tight and then just like before we can start to round the dough off into a nice little round it doesn't have to be perfect at this stage we just want a nice uniform shape now that our dough is nice and pre-shaped we've brought some of the structure back into the dough and they're nice and tight before we final shape these though they need to be allowed to rest for 10 to 15 minutes so the gluten can relax again and then we'll get to final shaping them [Music] dust just slightly on your bench with the flour and now we're going to take one of our pre-shaped doughs and flip it upside down okay a little bit of flour on your hands what we're going to do is pick up the baguette on each side and just stretch it out a little bit place it down now we're going to take the top of the dough and we're going to fold it towards us about two thirds of the way down the side of the dough just like this and just use a little bit of gentle pressure on that edge to make sure that the dough sticks now we need to turn the dough 180 degrees so turn it around and we're going to do the exact same thing we take this top edge here and fold that towards us two thirds of the way down pressing just gently so that the dough sticks now we just need to add the finesse to the shape so what we do is we remove all of the dry flour otherwise if we try to roll on top of flour it's not going to roll properly it's just going to slide starting in the center a little bit of pressure and then move your hands apart and apply more and more pressure as you get to the ends to make that beautiful tapered edge now we're going to lay our linen cloth over the tray dust generously with flour so that our dough doesn't stick and now we're going to place our dough onto the floured linen tea towel it's important this smooth side on top that's going to be our presentation side so what we're going to do is we're going to flip it upside down and you can see that seam that we closed earlier on that line that's running through the center there that's now facing up let me show you what we do here with our tower we pick up from the sides and lift it up so that there's a little bit of a separation between each baguette make sure you place them down with the seam side facing up and they're going to sit right up against each other so they give each other a nice warm cuddle now we're going to cover it completely i'm going to place another tea towel on top so that we can put them to bed okay and then we need to leave them to final proof now that they're in their shape for about 45 minutes to an hour until they're nice and supple to the touch and then we can place them into our hot oven to get a really nice crispy crust on your baguettes it's important that you bake on a hot baking stone so now that your baguettes are starting to proof it's time to preheat your oven with this baking stone in the oven set at 240 degrees celsius on the conventional setting which is the top and bottom element heat not fan force and you need to preheat that oven nice and hot for at least half an hour before you bake i've got my baking stone preheating in the side of the oven on the other side of the oven i just have a tray there getting nice and hot because once i place my bread into the oven i want to throw a little bit of water onto this hot tray to create lots of steam and quickly shut the door to capture as much of that moisture as possible our baguettes should be final proof so let's uncover them you can see they've expanded and plumped up when i press them you can see how the dough slowly bounces back slowly springs back and that's a good indication that they're ready to be baked if i was to touch them and they sprung back really really quickly then that would tell you that they need longer to proof okay they're under proofed and they're still got a lot of life a lot of energy in them so just leave them for another 10 to 15 minutes but as it is at the moment the dough is springing back just ever so slightly so these are beautiful and ready to bake with if you have a pizza peel at home you can use a pizza peel but if not you can simply use an upside down tray [Music] to slide your baguettes off the tray into the oven nice and easily to prepare our tray we dust with some flour we get our baguettes remember these were placed onto our towel here with the same side facing up so i move it out get my thumbs underneath carefully carefully twist it over and then gently pick it up and place it down dust with a little more flour on top to slash our bread we're going to use a baker's lamb which is the tool that we use to properly score the bread okay now i'm going to come on top and very gently but with a quick motion do three lines going nice and straight down the length of the baguette making sure that each time i stop and then i come over and i overlap the line so i'll show you exactly what i mean overlap overlap overlap overlap there we go so i have a few tablespoons of water ready to dump onto our hot tray to create the steam i've got my baguette slashed onto the flour tray ready to go it's time to bake here we go dump the water onto the tray and very quickly close the oven door bake for 10 minutes initially then we're going to remove that tray with all any residual water that's on that hot tray then close the oven door again and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until our baguettes are beautiful and deep deep golden in color it's been 10 minutes let's have a look fantastic i'm gonna take the tray out of the oven and just leave the oven door open for a couple of seconds you can see that that steamy environment has allowed our dough to expand beautifully now we're going to close the oven door look at these beautiful baguettes they're ready they're so deep deep golden they look absolutely stunning look oh look at that crust that's the right sound that's the sound we like oh guys let's see the big reveal let's have a look beautiful look at that lovely open crumb structure lots of gassy bubbles it's going to be lovely and light when you eat it and the crust is still nice and crispy absolutely stunning and i'm going to cut a slice for me because you're not worried about me all you're worried about is to eat worry about it it's the best time of the race don't you trust me it's good enough you don't need to try it it's crunchy i couldn't be crunching moist at the same time such as more bread wow i need some extra virgin boy on top put some more in the middle a little bit of tomatoes some mozzarella please guys write a comment yeah what else do you want let us know what you think tell us what would you put inside your baguette what type of sandwich would you make that's right that's what we want to know what type of sandwich rather comment below follow us on instagram and subscribe don't forget to subscribe thank you so much the baguette mean chances play thank you anthony ciao you're welcome great man who shared us who shared all his secrets with us so tomorrow i can go and open a bakery and i'll call it

He is a master of the\nmost French food there is and he happens to be the\nson of a Tunisian immigrant. (upbeat music) (low beep)", "5mehXzl7yHA": "what's up today i'm going to show you guys how to make a really easy rustic bread dough and then we're going to look at three ways to turn that dough into something crusty and delicious for your table you don't need any skills you don't need a stand mixer and you definitely don't need a sourdough starter so if that sounds like fun stick around let's get started [Music] like i said this is not a sourdough bread recipe and i've designed it for the beginner baker so if you've never made bread before this is going to be a really great place to start one thing that i definitely want to do though is strike that balance between complexity of flavor and simplicity of process so we are going to start by building a pre-ferment and all i mean by that is mixing some flour water and yeast together before we actually mix our dough to build some flavor and to give the final product a little bit more color and structure the type of pre-ferment we're doing here today is called a poolish and you might recognize that from my baguette video a few weeks ago to make that foolish you're going to mix together 150 grams of room temperature water a small pinch of yeast like an eighth teaspoon or 30 or 40 granules and 150 grams of all-purpose flour you're just going to stir that to combine throw a lid on it and let it sit on the counter from anywhere from four to twenty four hours a well-aged poolish gives us a darker crispier crust and a longer lasting more resilient bread overall if you can get yourself to do a little bit of planning i highly recommend letting this ripen overnight you can get away with a four-hour pre-ferment here i've done it a few times that way and it works out totally fine but more time equals more flavor so to mix this dough we're going to grab a medium stainless steel bowl and into that we're going to measure 280 grams of warm water 2 grams of yeast all of the poolish that we mixed yesterday take a second to stir that to combine into the water a little bit that's going to make the hand mixing part of this much easier in a second to that slurry we're going to add 350 grams of all-purpose flour 50 grams of whole wheat flour and 10 grams of salt to do this mix we're gonna grab a sturdy spoon and stir everything to combine we're trying to keep this dough from getting stuck to everything in sight so combining it this way with the spoon is the tried and true cleanest way of making dough without a mixer once things are combined and we can't really move it around with a spoon anymore we're gonna make our hand very wet and then we're gonna get in there and finish it off the move here is to squeeze rotate and repeat this replicates the motion of a fancy bakery style orbital mixer all we're trying to do is just combine the ingredients all of the strength building and gluten development are going to come a little bit later through the folding process after about 60 to 90 seconds of squeeze rotate repeating with a wet hand things are looking good they're well combined so i'm going to grab some plastic wrap i'm going to wrap this up and set a 30 minute timer all right it's been 30 minutes since we mixed this dough i'm going to take the plastic off here no strength it's a really slacky boy right now i'm going to wet my hand and we're going to come and do the sort of tuck and fold method you've seen me do a few times on this channel so my hand's real wet you don't want to mess around with dry hand here because it will get all up in your arm here anyway so that's what it looks like i'm going to reach in kind of scoop from underneath pull and fold it back over itself i'm going to do that like eight or ten times pulling up throwing back take it to the point where the tension is starting to sort of the dough is like really feels like it can't go any further fold it back and you can see real quick that this does start to get a lot more strong what we're doing is just layering the gluten network those things start to stack up on top of each other get hooked up so now i've got it folded i'm going to do a little bit of a tuck maneuver here this is kind of like a slapping kind of like a slap and fold so you're going to scoop it from underneath turn it 90 and then kind of tuck we're just trying to get this dough into kind of like a taut round ball basically i'm just going to do it six or seven times it's almost like if you were on the countertop shaping a bowl that's what i'm doing right here this is just another way for me to get a little bit extra in there and then that's it like it went from a really gross looking shaggy mess into like a nice tall tucked ball look at that okay [Music] after 30 more minutes or 60 minutes total at this point we're going to come back and repeat the folding like i mentioned before these two quick rounds of folds are all we need to get a well-developed and strong dough that's easily going to hold itself up in the oven once things are folded up again we're going to wrap this with plastic and i'm going to ferment it for one more hour that's going to be two hours total of bulk fermentation after that two hours the dough should look bubbly and alive and really buoyant it should smell sweet and yeasty and at that point we're gonna shape the loaf and i'm gonna show you three different ways to do that and it's gonna be a little bit more complex each time we're starting with the most easy of course it's going to be something that literally anybody could make you don't need any special gear or previous experience we're going to move on to something that's like 15 more complex but 50 percent better in terms of crust flavor and just overall outcome and the third way is going to be a big dog fully shaped bowl that's just going to blow anything you can get at the grocery store out of the water so let's start with the easiest way you can get this dough into the oven i'm going to flip the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface and then i'm going to lightly flour the top i'm going to grab a half sheet tray and line that with a piece of parchment and then i'm going to liberally flour that as well using a dough scraper or a well-floured knife we're going to cut this dough mask into two pieces the only shaping we're doing here is a gentle tuck under and sort of prop up thing just to get a perky well-structured mound of dough that's gonna sit up on itself when you move it to the sheet tray if things are going well you should have two strong well-risen chunks of this dough that are relatively rectangular for the absolutely fastest and most simple path to making bread just preheat your oven to 525 degrees and spray these loaves with a little bit of water once the oven is up to temp i'm gonna throw the sheet tray in there and bake it for 20 to 25 minutes or until things are really well browned and starting to get crusty be careful because the bottom of the sheet tray can get pretty hot it is metal so just try to keep it away from the heating elements if they're on the bottom of your oven so that's method one of three tons of flavor from the poolish and plenty of good bread utility you could wipe it through something saucy or turn it into a crostini but we can definitely do better so to get to method two we're gonna move on to something slightly more complex here we're gonna be baking these in a dutch oven with a lid so starting at the point where we have the two pieces of dough set up on the floured sheet tray i'm gonna cover that with another sheet tray and let it proof on the counter for 30 to 40 minutes at that point i'm going to load a dutch oven into a 525 degree oven and let it preheat after that oven is well preheated and my dutch oven is ripping hot i'm going to grab that sheet tray of proofy dough and i'm going to cut the parchment in half i'm going to give these loaves a quick slash with my bread lame and this is more of a gesture than anything else i like to have a tear on top of a rustic bread like this it's purely aesthetic once we've got that cut we're going to carefully lift the parchment paper and the loaf and place it into the dutch oven we're going to cover this and bake it in the oven at 500 degrees for 12 minutes at that point we're going to remove the lid of the dutch oven and turn things down to 485 degrees so we can continue baking for an additional 12 to 15 minutes we're looking to get a very crusty very dark almost reddish loaf with the second method here in the dutch oven we get a much more interesting crust in a more well-risen loaf the duchy traps the steam the loaf gives off naturally when it bakes and it gives us a much glossier more brittle and longer lasting crust so i'm gonna let this loaf rest and then load the second piece of dough repeating the steps we did for loaf one i love this loaf of bread it's very creamy toasty yeasty it checks all of the boxes if we put this loaf next to the first one we can see a real uptick in terms of quality the crust is much more set it's darker it's more brittle and you can bet that it has a lot more flavor okay if you're ready the third variation here is a big dog fully shaped in proofed bowl and as a reminder all these loaves have the same dough as a starting point we're just changing up how we shape them and how we bake them so to shape this bowl we're going to flip the whole dough out onto a well-floured work surface i'm going to hit my proofing basket with some flour and don't worry if you don't have one of these we're going to get to that in a second we're going to shape this entire thing we're not going to be cutting this in half so to do that we're going to grab a side of it pull it out and fold it back we're gonna repeat that motion and work our way around the dough once things are stretched and tucked up into a ball grab opposing sides and do a crisscross tuck repeating that three or four times this point we're going to flip the loaf over and round things off using your hands at ten and two we're going to create tension and rotate the loaf keeping the seam we just created in the center and on the bottom this is just a larger scale version of what we do with burger buns and check a full slo-mo demo of that in the chicken salad video we're gonna flip this shape loaf seam side up into a nine inch proofing basket wait a second so lauren convinced me and now i agree that most of you guys aren't gonna have a nine inch proofing basket so in the spirit of a truly beginner's recipe i just washed out the medium stainless steel bowl that we proof the dough in so we're gonna transfer that over to that and to do that grab a tea towel fold it twice and line the stainless steel bowl at that point we're gonna flour everything liberally because tea towels are not really designed to have dough in there but it will work as long as we've got plenty of flour to keep the dough separate from the cloth we're going to put this on the counter for 30 to 50 minutes after about 45 minutes the loaf is buoyant it's full of gas and has risen dramatically when it comes to proofing an exact time is always really hard to say so just try and replicate how this loaf looks and the overall size to what i have here to make this we're going to flip this whole thing into our hand and carefully lower it into the dutch oven if you're not down with this move because your dutch oven's real hot and you're not a bad dog you can flip this whole loaf onto a piece of parchment paper and just lower it into the oven like we did in method two a full rustic bowl and this style needs to be scored on top so that it can open and rise to its full potential in the oven so for that i prefer scissors and that's because it's rustic looking it's really pretty and it doesn't require any skill i'm going to turn the temperature down at this point to 485 we're going to bake this big dog for 18 minutes covered in an additional 25 to 35 minutes uncovered this is going to depend on how good your oven is but we want to bake it dark like really dark the majority of the fun flavor here is going to come from that deep toasty multi-crust so don't be scared after about 40 minutes total our loaf is looking really dope it's brittle and crisp and rustic and it's just everything that a fun loaf of bread should be and oh yeah it sings when it comes out of the oven listen so we got the three breads we got the easiest one here which isn't bad but the crust is pretty dead um but i mean it's still good bread we can i'll cut into it real quick like not even that stupid of crumb it's nice bread like if anybody gave this to you in a restaurant you'd be stoked on it it's got good flavor yeasty and this crust can come right back if you throw it in the oven like i mentioned before so total winner for almost no work right here this is the one that was baked in the dutch oven again like fine crumb but that's not really what we're after we want something that has life and has a lot of flavor and is crispy and has a much more interesting crust than the unsteamed just like straight up baked in the oven one and if you were to pop this back in the oven it'd be super brittle really fun this is a big chunk of bread oh my this is essentially just a giant baguette it's one it's a one kilo baguette taylor made for dipping dippage oh baby robust crust i want to say one more thing before i go and that's everybody deserves this a simple easy rustic bread is just a core tenant of a good life and if you enjoyed this video

"YZbRpFOiOLs": "hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I want to show you how I make a homemade baguette now by no means am I saying that this is like the French classic authentic baguette because anti-romantic porta fire at the France a Paris nowhere but I do know that I like my bread I love my carbs and I certainly love a good homemade baguette and I think I really enjoy this recipe I make this up very often if you watch our vlog channel which I'll have a link down below you'll know that I make this very often it has been wildly requested so I figured I'd share with you my version this is how I make it it comes out perfect every single time so I figured I'd share with you the ingredients you'll need are few and very basic starting off with some flour I'll talk about this in just a minute you also need some salt I've got some warm water here with a little bit of sugar in there as well and you'll need some active dry yeast now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my yeast and sprinkle it over my water and sugar and just let those sit aside for a few minutes while we talk about the flour the flour I'm using is Italian double over our you can absolutely use regular all-purpose flour it will be just fine I just tend looking at this ovens preheated I did for another recipe I like to think that this just gives me a little bit of a better texture to my bread but regular all-purpose flour would work wonderful here now I know that to make baguettes there are tons of different variations of doing it you know some require cold water and rising overnight mine isn't like that mine doesn't take overnight to do and just once you see the result I think you really appreciate it you'll get really delicious crisp crust on the outside and real chewy inside it's just perfection on every level I'm going to make this in my standing mixer just to make life a little bit easier on myself all I'm going to do is add my dry ingredients to my mixture and wait for my yeast to activate my yeast is looking good you can see it's foamed up at the sides and I can really smell it which is always a good sign I often get questions about when they make bread recipes or Center roll cinnamon buns or whatever and people say you know my bread didn't rise or what did I do wrong everything came out really hard chances are your yeast either was not activated properly or it expired so if you're you still an activate you're not going to get a good bread so now all I'm going to do is let this mix for a good at say five to six minutes or until the dough kind of comes together and I will show you what it looks like was there okay now do not panic because this is a very sticky dough but it is going to create what I like to think of is a really amazing baguette so don't worry about it it'll all be alright what I have here is an oiled bowl I just have it oiled with some vegetable oil but you can use anything you want and then I've got my dough scraper here handy because this is going to help me get my don't out of here really nicely because a spatula is just not sturdy enough to get my sticky dough out don't worry if it looks super sticky you're gonna have to trust me when I tell you it will work alright let's get it off for there I'm just going to take my pastry brush take the oils on the side and Pat it all over the top and now I'm going to do is I am going to cover this with some plastic wrap and stick it somewhere warm I'm going to put mine in my microwave not turning to my girl wave on leave it in there for an hour and a half to two hours it really depends on the environment it's in you want it to double up in size pretty well it'll take between an hour to two hours so just keep your eye on it and when it's there we will move on to the next step I don't really now remember because this is more of a wet dough it's not going to get old domed like a pizza dough would so relax now what I have here this is like a little baguette pan they put on top of a baking sheet you do not need this at all I use it because it makes my baguette look a little bit more like a baguette like the bottom just looks really nicely you don't need this just use parchment paper on a big baking sheet and you're good to go so that's don't ever think that you need specific things to something to come out right I would never just show you a recipe that you would need like to go out and find one of these which by the way I just buy on Amazon because it's easy I find everything on Amazon all my work surface I'm going to flour this generously with flour because our dough is very sticky you get this out of here I'm also going to flour my little dough scraper and get this all out of here flour at the top and then you're just gonna knead this for like two minutes just to pull it together and you see what I'm doing with my dough scraper I'm kind of picking up a little flour picking up a little bit of the dough just making sure nothing is really sticking much you don't want to add so much flour that you get a really heavy dough you don't want that you would just want to add enough flour to make things a little bit easier like that's looking pretty perfect for me you can see it's really supple still I'm just going to flour right there because that's what I'm going to place it for now I'm going to take my flour and sprinkle it over my pan that just gives you really good look to the baguette and then just you can use a scale but I don't do that I just use a little bit a little knife and just cut these into threes as equally as you can manage so what if once slightly smaller than the other I'm not coming over I'm not going to know and then you're just going to take this a little bit of extra flour and you're going to roll this into a rope you see that those imperfections create the best crust on a baguette in the entire world so if you're thinking to yourself look so ugly uh-uh that is perfection just trust me honey don't worry about it it will work out so then just do the exact same thing on the other two you can see this once would be a little bit bigger than the first one but that's that's okay with me if it's okay with you okay I'm in there nicely then I take a knife but I'm just going to make a few slits at the top just like that I usually do about four and three on that one sprinkle a little bit of flour like that and now I'm going to cover these with a like a lint-free towel I have a couple here there you go and I'm going to place this somewhere warm now at this point I'm just going to place mine on top of my stove just because it helps just get things to rise a little bit better and this doesn't fit my microwave that's the real story otherwise I pop it in there what is it okay I'm gonna let this ride until it's about doubled in size I'll show you what it looks like when it's on in the meantime this can take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour in the meantime take a cast-iron skillet place it at the very bottom like take your one of your shelves out of the oven in place at the very bottom it'll go take a cast-iron skillet put the cast on skill on top of the rack and get that really nice and hot pre-heat your oven to 475 it'll take a good half-hour to preheat always mine does maybe a little bit less whatever so in the time in that time while this is rising bring your oven with a cast-iron skillet it'll all make sense in a little bit I promise that it's exactly what you want to see now I have my oven preheated to 475 it needs to be really hot I've got one on the show on the very top it's a tough you know as high as it'll go and want the very bottom and as low as it'll go at the very lowest shelf I have a cast iron skillet preheating in there alongside with the oven for about 30 minutes or so this took about 35 minutes to rise because I have my oven on so it definitely helps I'm going to pop this into the very top rack as soon as I'm done doing that I'm going to then pour a cup of cold water in the cast iron skillet that's going to create steam therefore giving you the perfect crispy exterior with really chewy interior that you're looking for when it comes to a baguette so in they go these beautiful babies were in the oven for exactly thirty minutes never fails I love love love this must be this why use a baguette Pam just because they look more like a baguette but totally not necessary let's just give this a go it's been cooling for about like ten minutes listen to the crunch just listen okay are you feeling me yet do you see just want you to come so close I want you to feel like you're inside a piece of bread look at that crust okay look at that lovely interior I know that I sometimes can be a little bit impatient and dig right in but I really want you to see how perfect these come out every single time and they are so easy home run so unbelievably good I mean really hmm these are incredibly good they're easy to make just a few steps which you as you can see there are a few steps involved but they're very easy easy steps that really just require a little bit of attention from you and the rest is secure itself go to Laura in the kitchen you're confident at the written recipe I hope you enjoy spending time with me and I will see you next time bye-bye you you", "4yp8UhNnj-w": "[Music] that's great so to get better flavor in our bread what we can do is add a preterm it so this pressure meant that I'm making food today is called we call foolish I've got 0.1% use because I'm creaming it for 18 hours and then I add equal quantities of water to flour so this is five hundred mils of liquids and because this is a wet so we can then just mix by hands so just mix it until all the lumps have been incorporated so now this fits for 18 hours at 18 degrees tomorrow when we come to make our bread it gets incorporated with the rest of our flour the rest of our salt and the rest of our water and then we can go to the process of making our dough so with the dried yeast active mold salt and baker's flour five minutes on Thursday keep wondering it's on second speed all right what we need to do now is a window test so what we're doing is we're assessing the gluten structure within the dough so what we're looking for is how far we can stretch it and how clear the dough becomes so that gives me a good stretch but it's still a little bit cloudy so that's around about 75% gluten development [Music] [Music] so I left in a fold the lift in the fold is done two three three purposes it redistributes the heat in within the dough it puts the yeast back in contact with a food source any delay as the gluten so we build a gluten structure with inside [Music] you [Music] you so we're now after shaping our final final shaping a baguette so what we do is I we get our dough placed on the bench give it a light pat down getting our top edge and folding it down and sealing three-quarters of the way down the dough and pick up the dough spin it around and then do the same action but this time we're going to bring it all the way down and feel it on the bench once we've done that we then go into a stage where we try to build tension in the dough so just molding from underneath pushing away and pulling towards you just to build the strength in the dough surface and then into our final shape around about 45 to 50 centimeters long and then we play in a Koosh ready for its final party [Music] you [Music] but what you do so most people will do this so all your hand movements come from underneath so what happens is you push the dole away from you but the dough actually moves that surface moves back against and that's helped build tension in the dough we don't get tension the dough you can't capture the casts being produced by the yeast to never mold your dough from the surface always mold from underneath [Music] you so once the dough has had its final proof we need to check to make sure it's ready to go in the oven and we do that by doing the press test so when our fingerprint user only bounces back half way and still leaves a small impression it's ready to go in if I press it and there's no movement and it stays compressed it's over proof you could bounce us all the way back needs a little bit more time and it's slightly under proved we're going to bake these on the sole of the oven or floor of the oven so need to take it from my Koosh onto my wooden boards getting them ready to school make sure you leave yourself plenty of space in between your meget for allow for expansion but also to put allows the proper time so when scoring make sure the cup stay in the middle of the leggett your blade is only round about a thirty degree angle and you then go down slash generally product assistance the scoring of the day gives us our final shape but it also tells the dough where to crack if we don't the dough tends to crack wherever it wants to so if I getting paid to the reason behind temperature we're baking at 260 degrees little baking around about 22 minutes and we give the product about three seconds worth of steam that steam allows that they get to expand with that before setting its crust and gives us those beautiful ears hopefully that will create by doing that undercut in the score so as we watch they should expand cut which is called oven kick and then we should get some beautiful colors being created on the crust if you're at home obviously you don't have these ovens so you want to turn your oven up as high as it can go we round about the 250 degree mark and if you bake on a stone a pizza stone or a an oven stone gives you a better result even if you don't have the stone place your bread on to a hot tray have your trail already in the oven and then all you do is you get a pan and you fill it full of untreated chain-link and then you place a few ice blocks on the chain and it will melt and create the steam steam needs to be in the chamber for about the first five minutes of the baking process but internally our bread needs to be over 93 degrees 93 degrees all enzyme activity six or yeast is dead and all starch has been fully gelatinize at this point is the flu based locally we have a look at the craft color we've got the three colors that we're looking for we've got the yellow the golden brown and the burnished this all gives us better flavor in our bread [Music]", "OgfG6QtdTEk": "Hello everyone, I'm Xiao Gao Jie. These days, it is upsetting to see the spread of the virus. When it becomes so disturbing, let's knead a dough together. Baguettes need only few ingredients. The less ingredients a bread needs, the harder it is to make. Dissolve yeast with room temperature water. Add flour and salt. I use all purpose flour. If you are not familiar with your all purpose flour, then use bread flour instead. Stir with a spatula. Stop when there is not dry flour left. You can mix flour and water by your hand. However this dough is quite wet and will be very sticky. Cover with lid and ferment for one hour at room temperature. During this period, knead the dough twice. After half an hour,  let's knead the dough. Rather than kneading, it is actually a process of stretching and folding. After pulling for ten times, the gluten becomes tight, and it is hard to stretch \u5b89any longer. Now we throw the dough to the bowl for a few times. It becomes smooth. This stretch-fold operation takes only half a minute. After another half an hour, do the same again. Then, wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, the dough is  two to three times as large. Dip some dry flour on your hands A big bubble comes up unexpectedly. You can tell from the big bubble that after fermentation, the gluten is pretty strong. It can actually be blown up like a balloon. Take a look at the dough under the  bubble. The inside is very wet. It is a such interesting network structure, Which eventually will become the structure inside of the baguette. Take out the dough and divide it into quarters. The cut surface is very wet Fold the wet sides inwards, and it becomes a ball. Let it rest for 40 minutes. Forty minutes later, take a dough. The dough soft and wet, but it doesn't stick to the chopping board at all after 40 minutes. Smooth side down. Press down gently with your fingers and roll up. More air bubbles remain in the dough by this way. Of course, you can seal it with the palm of your hand. Press in the middle first. And roll it longer with your hands. It will shrink, roll it out as long as you can. Then stop and work on the next one. All four are done, pick up the first one. Now roll it to the length you want. This length is directly related to the size of your oven. If it shrinks badly, you can rest it for another 5 minutes. Sprinkle a light layer of dry flour on the parchment paper. Put on the dough. Put another one. Lift the parchment paper in the middle. Let the dough rest for 40 minutes in the partition of the baking paper. My home temperature is 21 degrees Celsius. If your home is warmer, shorten the final fermentation time. It is time to preheat the oven. Take your old, worn-out baking pan. Put some small stones. It is OK if you don't have any stones, just put the empty baking tray in the oven. Preheat the oven at highest temperature. My oven is 550 \u00b0 F, 285 \u00b0 C. After forty minutes, cut the paper. Bake two at a time. Use a pizza peel to transfer them to the oven with paper. Before entering the oven, score the bread. Your kitchen knife is definitely not going to work. Put in the oven. Pour boiling water on stones. Be careful not to splash water on the glass on the oven door. The glass will crack when it encounters water. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Done! The steam baking method not only makes the surface of the bread very crispy, but also makes its color very beautiful By looking at it,  you can feel how crispy it is. Cool down a little, let's cut open to see inside structure. Many large bubbles and small bubbles are evenly distributed through the bread. This is a relatively wet dough, but it doesn't require lots for kneading. Kneading only took a minute all together. We have to know how to utilize time effectively for bread making. After all, time is one of the most important ingredients in baguette making. Thank you for watching. This is Xiao Gao Jie. See you next time.", "xlN5CgQcvAg": "[Music] our dough pieces have completed the intermediate fermentation of approximately 30 minutes and now we're ready for the most exciting and perhaps most difficult part of the packet making process the shaping of the baguette adobe's is a beautifully fermented beautiful texture we are working from left to right and we are taking our dough pieces off so we can replace them back onto the couch after shaping your setting our couch again I'm showing that there is enough flour on them rather a little bit too much flour on the final budget then too little it's an absolute calamity if the dough sticks to the couch which mostly happens on the new couch it hardly ever happens once the couch has been seasoned and used several times putting a bit of flour down and we start with our first baguette you're patting it down gently sort of with a curved hand patting out the larger bubbles but not all of them we're folding it over by 2/3 and then gently pushing it forward tightening up the dough on the outside flip it over by 180 degrees we're bringing the edges a little bit to ensure that the bucket doesn't get too long too early on bringing the ends and we're folding over the dough again by about two-thirds pressing gently the dough forth again the tightening of the dough very important we create a little farro with our thumbs we are rolling over the dough over the thumb and then tighten it again with a similar movement perhaps one more time to ensure that it o is really tight and one can see how the dough wants to jump back we're really tightening the surface beautiful bubbles are visible let's just check that it at the table has enough flour so we're rolling over the dough now for a final tensioning left thumb roll the dough over the thumb and with the heel of our right hand we are sealing the dough one can see that there's a nice fairly straight seam on the top and now we're giving in the final roll out to about 40 centimeters a classic baguette has about 350 grams and 60 centimetres long obviously we can't bake in a domestic oven 60 centimeter baguettes so we're making it smaller in dimension and by weight 220 grams and 40 centimeters we're making it slightly pointing to demonstrate that it's a hand shaped forget and we're placing it onto our Koosh folding up the Koosh to create a barrier and to kind of contain our baguette during the final fermentation number two padding out larger dough bubbles fold over by two-thirds tightening the surface flip it 180 degrees bring in the edges a little bit so it doesn't get too long at the beginning of the shaping process fold over by two-thirds and again tightening the dough we create a little farro with our thumbs fold it over with your hands and again tighten it by pushing it away perhaps one more time and one can see how beautiful and tight it is notice that the seam is always sort of straight during the entire folding process also notice that the thickness of the baguette is about the same we cannot correct everything in the final process now for this step we are rolling over the dough over the thumb and the heel of the right hand will seal the seam let's check our seam nice and closed if there's too much flour the seams would not close so well and from the center outwards we are rolling it into about 40 centimetres slightly pointy make sure that you have a little bit of flour on the baguette in case it feels a bit sticky and we're placing it onto the cush and number three hide out the dough fold over two thirds first tensioning flip 180 degrees bring a doubt piece together flip it over 2/3 again tightening it gently another one and again it's nice and tense we make a pharaoh then we're rolling it over our thumb and sealing it with the heel of the right hand a little bit of flour and from the center outward yeah shaping it again little point remember seam on the top and we are placing it into our Koosh make a fold and we're ready for the next one this time in Baker speed in making the dough strong on the outside but the inside we are retaining the beautiful area bubbly structure of the dough and our last one number eight for insurance a slight dusting and we're sending it off to the final fermentation covered with a cloth tuck it in gently allow it to ferment for approximately 30 minutes this is now the final fermentation after this fermentation the packets will be brought into the oven as always we are tightening up our table and we now wait for other gates for their final rise the shaped wickets have undergone the final fermentation of about 25 minutes although we are still a bit early one can feel it on presses makes an imitation and if it jumps back too quickly one must let it go a little bit longer however since we only can bake for but gets at a time in a domestic oven we now will remove four onto a transfer board and place the remaining four into the frigerator for baking later on to transfer the baguettes yeah dusting our board to ensure that we that the baguettes will slide off easily one way is especially when they have not proven too much one can pick them up by hand however this is not the particularly best methodology as we are handling them a bit too much the professional Baker uses a transfer board and we flip the baguette onto the transfer board notice now that the seam is on the bottom and we gently slide it onto the onto the board and once more the spaghetti are now ready for cutting but before we do that we place these in the refrigerator if they have proven a bit more one could leave the cover off to make sure there is instant heat exchange and the baguettes cool down and stop the fermentation in this case I'm confident that they can be covered for the fresh raishin face so these will go in the refrigerator and bake once the first four buckets have come out of the oven [Music]", "eQLTJLF89A4": "hey what's up everyone deserves to know what a really great fresh baguette right out of the oven tastes like today I'm gonna show you how to make one [Music] let's be totally honest outside of France the word baguette is used very loosely and I'm not here to police and call people a lot of fake baguettes but to me a bag that means one very specific thing we're talking about flour water salt and yeast that's fermented to make something that's cracker e toasty creamy and tender all at the same time in my mind the place to start when you're talking about a really great baguette is how we ferment it our baguette is going to be paying tribute to a classic style pre ferment which is called a Jewish a poolish is basically this flour and water that we mixed together ahead of time with a little bit of yeast and we let it ripen on the countertop overnight before we mix that into our final bread dough for our Polish we're gonna mix together 150 grams of bread flour and 150 grams of room-temperature water so that we're gonna add a very small pinch of yeast once all that stirred up to combine we're gonna let it sit on the countertop overnight for about 12 to 16 hours the next morning when we come back our polish smells really sweet it's very yeasty and it's all boozy and full of gas in my mind making a Polish is the ideal way to build a ton of flavor and complexity into a yeasted dough without over fermenting it or making it tired and sluggish now we're gonna move into the beginning part of our mixer so grab your stand mixer or a stainless steel bowl if you're doing this by hand which is entirely possible by the way into that bowl we're gonna measure 240 grams of warm water all of the right polish that we ripen to overnight and 400 grams of bread flour AP flour will definitely work here too if that's all you have but I like bread flour here for you guys at home mainly because it makes the shaping part of this bag and a little bit easier later on we're gonna start by mixing this on low speed just until things are well combined at this point we're gonna move this dough into a quick 20 minute Auto lease to slowly hydrate this flour for a quick refresher on what Otto Lee's is and why we do it check out the sourdough tips video from a few weeks back I'll link to that down below once everything is combined we're gonna cover the bowl with a tea towel just to keep things from drying out we're gonna let that hang out and on at least for about 20 minutes and after that we're gonna come back and add two grams of yeast and 10 grams of malt powder we're gonna start mixing on low to get that combined and hydrated before we add our salt mul powder is not a hundred percent necessary but it does go a long way in replicating a pro-level baguette this is just one of the small adjustments I've made to this formula to make it a little bit more friendly to the home baker most professional bread bakeries have access to a flower called malted flour this just means that a very small percentage of the flour is supplemented with malted or sprouted barley flour adding multiplier increases it's ferment ability but it also gives our crust that distinctive brittle shiny almost dark red crust that we really want in a harsh style bread especially a baguette I got this stuff for like seven bucks on Amazon so it's kind of like my bee man's home bread hack 2020 Edition once our yeast and Mulder is welcomed by and we're gonna add in 11 grams of salt I'm gonna continue to mix this on medium low speed for about 2 minutes at that point I'm going to turn up my mixer to about medium-high and knead for an additional two to three minutes or until the dough clears the bowl and starts to slap the sides a little bit so there's a real art and science to mixing dough out there for sure but small batch home dough mixing is just a matter of making it strong enough so give it a hard time in the bowl to get there maybe about four minutes total at that point we're gonna wrap it up with plastic wrap and we're gonna set a 30-minute timer after that thirty minutes we're gonna give this door one strength-building fold I like to stretch the dough out till I feel real tension and then just fold it back over itself after five to six of those folds we're gonna grab this whole massive dough and kind of just fold it up under itself to create a nice taut shiny top at this point the dough should be plenty strong for a baguette but if you're doing this by hand you might want to add a second fold at the 60 minute mark just to make sure that it's getting all the way strong mine's feeling good so I'm gonna move on we're gonna set a two hour timer well let those fermenting I'm gonna mention that for real baguettes at home you probably need a lame a lame is just the term we use for a fancy razor blade holder that bakers used to cut slits in the bread for these bad gets to open properly and get the look and texture of a real baguette we need uniformed slanted cuts that go pretty deep into the dough owing to this one down below if you're interested this one came with a leather blade cover which is very helpful for safety as these are super sharp so stay frosty with these things okay so it's been two hours in our dough is roughly doubled in size it looks alive and is pre gaseous I'm gonna flip this dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and I'm gonna divide it into four 225 grams pieces I turned this into a four piece recipe just so you could have some extra baguettes to either share with friends or even freeze them I figure any time you're gonna go through the trouble of making and fermenting something it might as well be a big batch so that future you can benefit from your hard work now once we've got our dough cut into four 225 grams sized pieces we're gonna gently turn them into little tot rounds this is called pre shaping we do this mainly to give ourselves uniform pieces of dough to start shaping with the move here is to use your left hand with the dough scraper to push the dough and your right hand to kind of pull it back towards you and tuck it under you don't want to go too crazy getting these too strong and tight the dough's pretty dry and doesn't need a lot of help we're just looking for a nice simple round shape once we got these pre shaped we're gonna let these stand here and rest for 20 minutes under a tea towel after 20 minutes rest time we're gonna come back to shape these baguettes to properly proof a shaped baguette you're gonna need a little piece of fabric called a Koosh this is a pretty rustic canvas cloth that we use to separate and support the little torpedoes of dough once we've shaped them if you want the real-deal baguettes set up at home I definitely recommend grabbing one of these off Amazon I think this one was like 12 bucks and it's very similar to what we would use in the bakery so the real challenge of making a great baguette is in this step the shaping step okay to start we're gonna clear the work surface off by flipping the other three dough balls into a lightly floured surface out of the way once you got your single dough ball we're gonna lightly flour the top and flip it on to that side so that the bottom is facing up this way we're just gonna gently degassed it and push it into a general rectangle shape starting from the top I'm gonna use the tips of my fingers to press and roll this dough over up and into itself each time I roll it on pressing it down and pinching it forward just to seal it up now we're gonna be rolling this tube that we've made back and forth putting pressure in the seam with our thumbs when we push forward and pressure with our fingertips when we pull it back towards us this rolling hand triangle move is how we stretch these out into a baguette shape is we get these stretched out more and more we use a little bit more pressure on the ends to taper it off that's how we get those signature points on the baguette be sure to keep this seam side down and use a little bit of pressure from our finger tips and thumbs when we're rolling this back and forth once we've shaped our baguette to roughly 12 inches in length we're gonna transfer this over to our floured Koosh the dough needs to be supported on both sides in two that we're gonna be pulling the canvas up with a little bit of slack creating a little bit of hill on either side that acts as a barrier from the other baguettes and also as a support [Music] we're gonna shape up the rest of these baguettes and we're gonna Koosh um up just as I described before to proof these we're gonna fold the linen over itself just to wrap the whole thing up make sure the sides are flipped over enough to create a little bit of support and tension on the outside baguettes almost if there was an ghost baguette out there holding it up once we wrapped up we're gonna let those proof on the counter for about 45 minutes at this point I'm gonna preheat my oven to 550 and put my baking stone in there to preheat this might seem like a really high temperature but home ovens aren't very powerful so we're overshooting on temp a little bit just to help replicate the thermal mass of a deck oven at a pro bakery so after 45 minutes our baguettes have risen quite a bit when I poke them with my finger you can see an indent but that indent kind of pops back that lets me know they're kind of at that perfect sweet spot of proofed so to make these baguettes we're gonna pull out our baking stone and put it on something that can handle the heat I've got a metal rack here I'm gonna give the stone some semolina flour to prevent sticking and then I'm going to transfer these baguettes over using what I call a flip board this is basically just a sturdy piece of cardboard from a box in my basement but anything the length of a baguette that's kind of sturdy and flat will do and then slide it on to the stone we're gonna repeat this for both baguettes once I've got these on the stone we need to arrange them a little bit just so we can make sure they fit under the lid once we're all situated we're gonna grab our lame and make three to four very deliberate diagonal slices on an angle and after we scored properly we're gonna grab a lid mine is a stainless steel bowl this cover is necessary to trap all the steam we need to get these baguettes to spring properly in the oven once I've got this stone covered I'm gonna load the whole thing into the oven and turn it down to 485 degrees I'm gonna bake this for 10 minutes with the bowl as a cover during this time the baguettes are gonna spring and rise and after that 10 minutes we're gonna carefully remove the bowl and finish baking these on 485 for an additional 8 to 10 minutes I usually go the full 10 minutes because I like my baguettes quite dark you know they're done when the outside begins to have a dark tan almost reddish quality to it when it's got that good dark color and it feels hollow on the inside we're gonna pull it from the oven and let it cool for about ten minutes the only bread I eat hot is usually a bad gas we worked really hard for that brittle crispy crust by making a foolish using mount powder and fermenting this whole thing very carefully so it's never gonna be better than after that first ten minutes so grab some fresh grassy salty butter smear it all over and let's eat some [Music] choice T yeah so that's a classic French baguette at home there's a few special moves here both a little bit of practice you can totally do it it's totally worth it I had a ton of fun breaking this down for you guys today if you have any questions leave them in the comments down below I will help you guys out the best that I can as always thank you guys so much for your time and attention thanks for sticking around and we'll see you next time", "udgkAfls4Bk": "look at this fantastic French baguette with Polish polish is a liquid starter widely used in France bakeries easy to handle foolish is one non technique to increase a dough's extensibility and develops Airy crab and a light taste of hazelnut to the baguette Oh for the 12 hours room-temperature polish whisk water with a pinch of yeast and flour scrape the side of the container well with a rubber spatula and cover with plastic wrap and seal it with a rubber band pocket and leave the polish on the countertop at room temperature for 12 hours look six hours have gone by then 12 it's bubbling and cracking it smells so great in order to remove the Polish easily and without deflating it pour the water in a center of the bubbling flesh and transfer it into the mixer bowl along with remaining yeast flour and salt mix for five minutes on low speed and five minutes more on medium speed or until dough is smooth and comes away from sides of ball since the dough is highly hydrated 75% do not add more flour if it looks soupy and the beginning of mixing the dough will come together too the air it should look just like that the temperature of the door by the way should be between 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit 24 to 27 degrees Celsius cover up though with a wet kitchen towel and let rise for 60 minutes then flour dough and transfer it onto a floured work surface do not put down next divide dough into four equal portion carefully deflate each portion and shape into loaves dust linen cloth with flour known as baker's couche or use a fragrance-free thick kitchen towel and let love's rest cover for 20 minutes gorgeous to shape loaves into baguette flatten each love and try not to deflate too many of those lovely air bubbles fall down the top third of the dough and use the heel of your hand to seal the edge repeat once then use the palm of your hand to gently press and roll the loaf into a long baguette form try not to go over the size of your baking tray as I did lay baguettes seam side up over a floured linen cloth flour the top as well and cover and let proof for about 45 minutes then carefully flip and transferred approved baguettes seam side down on an upside-down baking tray lined with the secon mat scored baguettes with a blade or knife and cautiously side the baking mat onto the heart baking tray or pizza stone spray water to create steam and shut the oven door immediately and peck for about 20 minutes at 500 degrees Fahrenheit 260 degrees Celsius guys Sunday mornings will not be the same for the full recipe go to Bruno's kitchen that net

they're awesome hi i'm sune and i'm a food geek\ntoday i'm going to show you how to make easy sourdough\nbaguettes what makes them easy well the hydration is pretty low which\nalso means that you probably won't get a super open crumb\nbut they'll still be great i promise you also to get the maximum level of gluten\ndevelopment with the least amount of work i'm working the dough\nin a stand mixer if you're already crushing making sourdough bread\nthe thing that makes baguettes hard is learning a whole new way\nof shaping it's quite different from batards\nand it's miles away from boules but don't worry i'll show you how it's done\nthe other thing that makes it easier is that i'm using a special pan for\nbaguettes instead of using a couche you may of\ncourse still use a couche if you want but especially loading baguettes into\nthe oven requires quite a lot of practice\nusing the pan you can basically just put the shaped baguettes directly in the\noven after retarding i left the

that\nyou'll have to experiment the hydration is 70% but i recommend you start out at 65%\nin case your bread flour isn't very absorbent\nit's easier to add more water afterwards the inoculation is 22.2%\nand the salt content is 2.2% you may wonder why these odd numbers\nwell it's because you can divide the recipe by three for one baguette\nand all the numbers will still be nice and whole

the\nwords this is the recipe the written recipe is\nlinked in the description down below the video\nyou may have to press the show more button or equivalent to see it\nto the bowl of your stand mixer add 675 grams of bread flour 15 grams of salt mix with the paddle attachment on one until it's been incorporated then add 150 grams of sourdough starter\nfed and grown to its peak 450 grams of water if you don't know the strength of your flour you might want to\nstart out with 400 grams of water and then\ngauge it while it's mixing adding as much water as needed\nmix with the paddle on one until everything has been incorporated then switch to the dough hook and mix on\nthree for five minutes check for a window pane by pulling a\nlittle piece of dough out and see if it's strong enough to pull the dough so\nthin that you can see light through it if it\nfails mix in increments of 2 minutes until it\npasses the test this first window pane is pretty bad the\ndope basically just falls apart instead of using a stand mixer you can\nalso knead the dough by hand until you get a window pane\nit'll probably take 10 to 15 minutes the second window pane is not much better than the first\nstill not very much strength the dough is now starting to show some\nstrength but it's not good enough yet ah perfect look at how far and how thin i can pull this dough. this is great. then move the dough to a see-through\nbulking container wet your hands and level the dough and mark the top of the dough with a\nwhite board marker then let the dough grow by 25 to 50\npercent this is how my dough looked after the\nfermentation then divide the dough into three equally\nsized pieces dust the top with flour flip the dough over and roll it up into\na tight log do the same for the other two then let them rest on the counter for 20 minutes\nand then proceed to the final shaping grab a log stretch it out to double the length you\nwant your baguette to be then fold the right side into the middle\nand then fold the left side into the middle then going all the way down the length\nof the baguette fold it back towards the front to about the middle of\nthe dough then flip it around then go all the way\ndown the baguette again folding from the back towards\nthe front all the way over this time then work the baguette across the table\npushing it forwards or backwards at the bottom\nof the dough to work the baguette to the exact length\nthat you want it then flour the pan with rice flour and\nadd the baguette to the pan you can also use a piece of parchment\npaper on the pan if you feel like the dough is a bit\ntoo wet continue with the other two the exact same way then sprinkle rice flour on top of all\nthe baguettes and add them to a bag big enough to hold the entire pan put\nthe dough in the fridge for at least 8 hours but up to\n48 hours when you want to bake heat your oven to 230 degrees celsius\n450 degrees fahrenheit i didn't use fan assist or convection but you can\nadd a pan to the bottom of the oven that will be used for steaming\ni have a baking steel in my oven which means i heat for an hour\nif you don't use one you can just bake when the oven says it's hot enough\nwhen the oven's hot boil a kettle of water then grab the baguette pan from\nthe fridge sprinkle the top of the baguette with\nrice flour score the baguettes with three long slightly overlapping scores grab the pan and add it to the hot oven\n[Music] pour the kettle of boiling water into\nthe pan at the bottom and quickly close the oven\nbake for eight minutes then open the oven and remove the steaming pan\nbake for about 25 to 30 minutes more until the baguette is\ngolden brown and super crisp remove the pan from the oven\nput the baguettes on a wire rack and let them cool down or you can just serve\nthem immediately let's look at these\nbaguettes up close and personal so how about that aren't they gorgeous they're super tasty too and go well with\nalmost anything i can

a very tasty soft and chewy interior a simple long thin crusty loaf of bread the baguette is traditionally made with only four ingredients flour water salt to taste and yeast as a leavening agent today I'm so happy to share with you this easy method of making this beautiful French baguette in your own home kitchen you after 2 hours the dough has risen well and let's keep the dough in refrigerator and now the first part of making a packet as done let's do baking the next day keeping the dough in refrigerator well slow down the fermentation process which will enhance the gluten formation as this is and no need a bread recipe and also this will import loads of favorite object and also it will make it easy for us to handle the dough now after one day take the dough out of the fridge and scrape down the sides of the bowel and turn it on to a lightly floured work surface and this dough is sufficient to make 5 packets of 250 grams baguettes are best when they are fresh out of the oven and so here I'm baking 3 of them today and keep the rest of the dough in the refrigerator to use later you now after 45 minutes take out the dough ball gently pad on the surface of the dough and fall down the top part from the sides and from the center and fold it again to create a tensive outer surface and use the heel of your hand to seal the edges if you feel comfortable you can rotate the loaf and again fold it from the top side down and then seal sprinkle the work surface and the loaf with enough love to make sure the dough doesn't stick to your hands and then use the palm of your hands to gently press and roll the loaf into a long baguette form start with your hands in the middle of the loaf and gradually move them towards outer surface of the baguette as you roll roll until the back at ease as long as your pan and transfer the shaped baguettes to her baguette pan or on to a homemade Coach like this to rise you and the loaves are ready to bake when they look puffy and ballooned it will take about one hour so after the final rising let's transfer this onto a baking tray if you find it difficult to transfer it with your hands you can use a something flat like this this is just a cardboard aligned with an aluminum foil this will help you to transfer those puffy long a dough into a baking tray safely [Music] with the help of a sharp knife or using a blade you can score the top of the ellipse by scoring like this we are creating a weak spot on the surface of the love and thus preventing the love from a bursting a twig points created during shaping now if they are ready to go into the oven bake it at 450 Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes or until they are golden brown in color professional ovens have a provision to create steam inside the oven so to replicate a professional oven as closely as possible place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven and spray some water on the top of the buckets and inside the oven the steam will create a moist environment which is needed during the initial few minutes of baking and help to get that crispy crackling trust after baking you will get those beautiful golden colored packets which are nice crispy on the outside and with a very tasty soft and chewy Crump inside let stand for the zone - a cooling rack and let them cool down completely before slicing I hope you will try this baguette recipe at

"Iran is now unloading the Bennet so back in the days before our nice handy-dandy Oliver we used to do this on top of hand mixing and pre shaping and manually spraying into an oven staying up all night so Jon's scaling the dough and then I am kind of stretching it out to be the right size and shape so when I'm doing this I just wanted to try to do it to where it's pretty uniform throughout it also has the right amount of tension and then Dylan will put it in some rice flour and push it in on a sheet tray we just found like shaping them into a log for example helps the next station do what they need to do which helps me do what I need to do on the final shaping it's got to feel right like you don't want the dough to be breaking like forming a skin and then breaking you just want it to be like it has a little a give like a good balance I don't want to say when I usually compare it to a nice but firm but it still has a little bit of jiggle the secret is learning how to use the table the stickiness of the table in my opinion the stickiness of the table to your advantage there are several different ways that you can pre shape it you're basically just going for a log so I like to flower ahead of time so I'm not sticking to every little thing so you can roll it just like this honestly it's very this part it's very like low pressure so roll like this pass it on you can also because you're kind of also trying to start the process of building tension so you can also roll it in on itself like a almost like what I'm doing on on the final step but like this these have been pre shaped and then and then cut that for a while so that tension isn't too strong to where we can't do the next few steps so here we can stretch this out bring both sides into the middle I don't for me almost like a bow tie and then pulling it into the stro and halfway just pulling it out and then sticking it to itself half way and I turn it around and grab this and pull all the way over so like completely closing then I roll that onto the scene and start to use the tension of the table to kind of get a uniform link so oftentimes like the center will be skinnier and then the ends are a little bit fatter so I just focus on the ends in that case if I have a bulge all this work that little bulge and I'm just using like my fingertips and as little like scoops and then with my thumbs I'm just pushing up against the table so it's almost like you're pushing it into itself so here I have a little bulb there just going to work it just slightly more and then you can choose a point it ends but you can choose to have rounded ends I keep mine a little bit like shorter and plumper just so that they fit the sheet tray better and also because when they come out to bake they will already get like a little bit like they're gonna be looser in tension so that when to take them off of here an inch onto the baking board there's a little bit you get more leeway and then I keep usually like a little pile of flour AP flour spur my hands on this part since Logan and Dylan Dylan are helping me out I have everything please preps for me if the dough is too sticky I can just quickly dab my hands in there brush it off so it's sticking a little bit over here so I just added a little flowers to Rebekah's because they're they're kind of one of the more difficult things to support even though it's like when you watch videos it's like almost like they do itself fast and confidently that it's hard to imagine that there's so much to check the technicality to it but I like to use this so that I can kind of get the blade this is a like more traditional mom so it's got a a wooden handle and then like a curved piece that I'm just going to put this blade onto you bend it away from you and slide it through so that has like this nice curve and I don't have to work as hard to make the lines I need to make this is right flower we just like to add a little color in contrast you want to say if you divide this into three lanes you want to say within your middle lane so if you had like a lane here and Elayne here you want all your lines to be in the center as best as possible he's just gonna kind of deal like that and then the second most important thing is that you want about an inch of overlap to get a nice ear and I like to hang all my blades so it's kind of lifting up under the skin as I cut so I'm gonna find the center of my baguette and try to keep all three of my lines in the center just gonna go like this so I'm between these two lanes I'm going to overlap one inch come through again and overlap one inch and then this is the fun part you have to like kind of put it in fast like pizza the loves make about 30 minutes these bake about 20 to 25 so we do 484 20 and then 15 minutes with 8 seconds of steam for the first half and then 10 more 10 more minutes 10 to 12 minutes so similar about lettuce order with a baby needs a lot Darvin I'm gonna take the sexiest one out so I did not shape these so they're not as beautiful as I could so this I'll take this one is like my favorite in terms of how the scorning came out I'm going for this little ear that's sticking up but I actually like these to be a little bit darker so I'm gonna put a back in if you don't nail this boring or nail the shape baguettes are so finicky so if you don't nail this boring or nail the shaping like it'll tell you I'm kind of baked like these got no ears basically and when this one was shaped this is the what happens if you don't focus on the uniformity throughout so you have this kind of funny shaped it's kind of like sitting in the middle but bull Germans I like them quite a bit crispy er whipped awake because they're not dark enough what happened here I don't know that's what I was explaining it's a shaving erage not shaping these customarily you don't want to cut it right when you take it out of the oven otherwise you're gonna get a really doughy weird texture inside so this has been cooling for about I don't know three hours or so so we're going to cut into it so you get that nice crumb shot hopefully I don't slice my finger off so in a bag yet especially you're looking for a much more open structure than what you would get in in a loaf or at least a little bit more open structure to me like I feel like it could be better really gonna be more open this is very close to like our little scrum so I would I would wish to see like more a little more openness of course nobody really cuts it like this I mean well that's not true if you're making a sandwich it's a great way to cut it I prefer to use these for a bruschetta so that's not that's pretty nice actually the cross-section view but I like to use these for bruschetta they're great for sandwiches crust is really nice you kind of hear it very delicious I would have actually bake this even darker preferably my preference we try to bake kind of a variety of everyone for everyone ranging from super light to want more on the darker side I prefer the darker side but it's actually very convenient because you when you're baking you have to like really get to know your equipment and like each deck of this oven bakes like just a little bit different like nuances with every deck so it kind of naturally does that even in the same desk like from left to right the right always bakes lighter I think it's because there's less seam on that side the steam comes out of the left so the left always tends to bake a little bit darker", "ba2DHI299PU": "hi it's martin i'm in the studio today with five tips for shaping baguettes okay five tips for shaping baguettes tip number one is simply practice in order to shape more beautiful baguettes you have to practice you have to put your repetitions in it's just like learning to play the piano or juggling or any other hand skill which is improved through practice and coordination so you've got to practice in tips two and three i'm going to give you methods which will help you to set that foundation and you're going to be well on your way to shaping beautiful baguettes tip number two for shaping baguettes it's pre-shaped before we make our final shape we have an intermediate step which we call pre-shape the more beautiful and regular our pre-shape is the more beautiful a final shape will have let me show you how to do it [Music] okay so i've divided these pieces into about 300 grams and let's give appreciate i'm padding gently to the gas and then i'm going to fold to the middle and seal if you see a large bubble just pop it so you see how i kind of brought this sides together sort of went like that and now i'm just going to start at the top and i'm going to roll down and press to seal roll down and press to seal and that looks good to me this is a tube or cylinder pre-shape let's do another one press to deflate slightly find any large air bubbles you can see that this piece isn't quite regular but that's okay we're going to fix that so again fold to the middle go to the top and it's basically a process of just kind of rolling it down i felt this sticking for just a second so i just drag it through a little bit of flour and what i'm trying to do here is really maintain sort of square walls if i can have square walls i'll have a roof which is beautiful and straight windows will go in easily to use sort of an architectural or building analogy so do you see how this is regular the more tubular this is the more beautiful and even my final shape will be okay tip number three for shaping baguettes this is what i'm going to call fold and roll i'm going to show you first how to fold and then how to roll and i'm going to demonstrate using a napkin so you can see very clearly what the folding steps are and then in tip number four we'll go to shaping the shaping of a baguette has two sort of sections the first phase is what i call sort of the origami phase and then the second is the actual rolling so for the origami phase i'm going to take this edge that's away from me i'm going to bring it two thirds of the way down we're basically making a letter fold press to seal edge that's closest two-thirds of the way up and then if you want to sort of identify for yourself what the middle portion uh that midline of the baguette is you can tap to do so and then you just bring this edge that's away down and seal you can either do that with the palm of your hand as you see bakers do or if you want you can also if it seems easier you can use your hand working with it as a paddle you can just take your fingers and you can press to seal and then you roll okay step number four for shaping baguettes in step two we saw a pre-shape in step three we got our method so step four let's shape a little bit of flour on my surface just a super super thin thin sheen of flour here and sometimes i like to have some a little bit out of my workspace up here a little bit and that way if as i'm shaping i need a little bit i can go up there often my hands might need a little bit or maybe the dough piece needs a little bit so i can sort of flip it up there okay so this is my tube pre-shape it's been sitting on the bench seam side down and the seam side is the side that i want on the interior of the baguette it's not the show side so if it was resting on the bench like that i just flip it over there's my seam okay so i pat to degas that will remove any large bubbles and i begin with what my letter fold right so about two thirds of the way down tap to seal if you see a large bubble you can just pop it turn this around and i'm trying to be regular i'm trying to maintain these square sides right trying to maintain that because like i said before if i have a square floor and square walls i'll have a nice roof and the windows are going easy you know so maintain that squareness so now about two thirds of the way down press to seal and if you want to have a sort of divot in the middle so you know where to divide the baguette there's my middle and now all i have to do is bring that to the leading edge and i'm done you can either do that as i showed using the palm of your hand to seal the heel there or you can use your fingers i'm a fan of using my palm so that's what i'm going to do so i bring this forward to the leading edge and i just press to seal and i basically have my tube so that was the folding portion and now i go to the roll and when i go to the roll i start in the middle and i just go back and forth and then i move my hands to the sides and then as i get to the points i taper just a little bit so back and forth and then hands applying soft pressure moving back and forth and as i get to the edges i just apply a little bit of taper and i look for the seam seam is there and i put it seam up on my koosh or my lid there's the seam let's shape i'm going to pat gently to remove any large air bubbles i get a sense of whether or not the dough is sticking to the bench the bench feels good it's got a light layer of flour and i can begin shaping so remember start with the letter fold sew that edge about two-thirds of the way down and then this side about two-thirds of the way down i'm trying to maintain this square presentation straight sides if i can maintain this straight aspect that'll translate into the final baguette and it'll be nice and even then i just need to bring this edge to the leading edge so bring it down press the seal and if your palm begins to stick a little bit just go out and grab a little bit of flour and that small sheen of flour on your hand that light sheen will be enough back and forth until i have a little bit of a divot here and then to the edges and press to taper baguette should have a nice seam and that will be the side that i put up when i put it on the couch so i place these on my flowered couch or linen seam side up between each dough piece i make a little bit of a pleat okay tip number five for shaping baguettes this is simply patience be patient with yourself be forgiving enjoy the mistakes if you make a baguette and it looks like a snake that swallowed an egg it's okay i've made a lot of those you'll see some of that along the way but often nobody else will notice but you so be patient with yourself enjoy those mistakes and happy baking you", "iai3Af_Q1OE": "today we're going to make baguettes but we're gonna make it using a pre front and this pre front is going to be a poolish so in preparation for doing that we're gonna end up having to mix this and then let it ferment over a certain period of time this is actually recorded today before because what I want to do is be able to show you what it's gonna look like now and then the stages that it ferments over until tomorrow so a poolish poolish is the same amount of flour and the same amount of water and a small percentage of yeast the the attributes to what it's going to give to the the baguette itself is giving a little bit more extensibility so ability to kind of stretch into a longer shape without having as much elasticity the the ability to kind of retract on itself it's also going to help with an open core open cell structure and then obviously flavor okay so we're gonna end up this is thirty percent of the overall flour weight okay and the same amount of water and then a small pinch of yeast and in doing this leaves that it's going to ferment overnight approximately like 14 to 16 hours and it's going to give a very almost like a sweet smell and flavor and it'll transcend in the baguette and you will be extremely satisfied with making that baguette as I mentioned it's only gonna be a very very very small amount of yeast so I'm actually just gonna put a little bit in here and it's literally just a pinch all right since it's gonna ferment for such a long period of time you really really do not need a whole lot and this now like I said it's 447 grams of water 447 grams of flour that I'll scale into here I'm gonna mix the water in the yeast together first just to make sure that they're it's all in there and it's it's not really gonna dissolve yet a whole lot but if you mix it together the water was at about 62 degrees to 65 degrees again I'm in Florida so the overall temperature in the air is probably around 70 to 75 in the house and so I since it is going to ferment overnight I don't want it to go too fast and it's gonna create this nice flavor so like I said it's between about 62 to 65 degrees that I scaled it off all right so now I need to clear it to zero again okay actually it was okay so now we have our 447 grams of flour for 47 grams of water our little pinch of yeast and we're just going to mix this that's such you can use your hand or the spoon but all we're really doing is it's not mixing a dough in any respect it is just getting this hydrated and then making sure that all of it is combined so again just make sure that all of the flour is hydrated you're not actually developing any gluten or anything of that nature by the mixing process and since it is the same amount of water same amount of flour it's going to be very liquidy as such so what we have is this right here consistent this is likely to it's gonna at least double almost triples so it'll literally be at the top when it does it's gonna you know have lots of bubbles that are inside it and you'll see a kind of doming and then slightly retracting all right so yesterday what we did was mix the poolish that is going to now be incorporated into the final dough the rest of the dry ingredients and obviously the water and for the overall formula we had a 2500 gram total dough wait all right it was a hundred percent flour 65% water 2% salt and 0.7% yeast instant yeast we took out 30% of the flour and then the same amount of water a little pinch of yeast let that ferment overnight so that was 447 grams of flour 447 grams of water and again just like it's a little less than a gram of yeast this had been mixed just by hand actually I used a spoon and it was allowed to ferment we're at about 16 hours right now right so as I mentioned it would have doubled if not even come close to tripling in volume and you want to get it at its peak which means it's gonna be startin to dome and then when a domes and it starts to recede ever so slightly that's when it's ready mine actually went all the way up to the very top of the container and thankfully I did put it on a plate because if I just keep this going it will continue to ferment and overflow what I want to do is just show all right and you can see how nicely this ferment it has a absolutely fantastic smell aroma and it's gonna add a tremendous amount of flavor plus it's gonna have some physical dough characteristics that's gonna allow it to be easier for baguettes where it's going to be extensible so when we're shaping it's gonna be able to stretch much easier then something that's a little bit more tight and a little bit you know different physical characteristics so what we're gonna do is with our mixing bowl pick the Polish see how nice and lively that is all right now this is the scaled water which is 523 grams best way to kind of clean out your container pour that in there and then all you got to do is just kind of scrape down your container and you'll get 99% of everything out okay as I was very common in bakeries to do excellent all right so you can see the water and the poolish right we're going to add dry I mean actually it's the same container to ferment the dough get the yeast okay so flowers at about 1400 or 1043 grams yeast about nine grams and the assault at 30 grams all right put this on the mixer and then if you remember make sure you've got it locked in on both sides here and then you're gonna push it down and it's a little clip that's behind if you don't do that it may shake the bowl and even come off again put your dough hook on turn it make sure that this is also locked in and solid lift up your bowl and then keep it at a low speed in the beginning [Applause] water temperature was at about 65 degrees there's gonna be some friction and temperature that's gonna come from the filter foolish also the flour temperature and the room temperature itself and then the friction of the mixer you're still looking for approximately 75 even on up to that 77 degrees at the most together the range between 73 to 77 degrees is good for baguettes all right so it's going through that pickup stage you're starting to bring it together okay so you can see it as it's picking up this has been about two minutes I'm gonna continue to let it incorporate to another pilot for five minutes and then I'll go into second speed to start to develop the bit okay so our dough's been mixing in first speed or low speed for about seven minutes total you can see that it's fully incorporated and now what we're going to do is go into a higher speed what we've just call our second speed which is going to be the development of the dough so these DS strengthening it's gonna stretch and pull to overlap the gluten strands so it gets stronger and stronger so we're just gonna increase that up and then this is gonna run for about three to three minutes at most they'll finished mixing what we did was about seven minutes and first speed low speed around two or so on a KitchenAid mixer and then I moved it up to about six to seven as a second speed to develop the dough and that was at about three minutes right this is I never on this KitchenAid mixer try to go to full development because they tend to destroy the dough or try to it also creates too much heat so often what I'll do is is mix it just slightly less and then I'll give it a little bit of a fold if necessary on the bench this is a slightly lower hydration than the straight dough baguette or a straight dough bread that we made the other day yeah so it's gonna be a little bit stiffer and you can see it in in pretty good shape right all right so I said it's not a hundred percent developed and that's on intended as such and what we're gonna do just give it a light fold very similar to what we had done before and then just kind of bring all this together and just put it in your proofing container all right want to check my dough temperature which is essential and we're at 77 degrees I'm at the high end and I need to be thoughtful about where this would lead if I did not get that but it's gonna ferment for anywhere from 50 minutes to about an hour maybe even an hour and 10 minutes it's my room temperature is pretty warm today it's about 75 degrees so I'm gonna check this kind of the lower minute side and then we'll see this but it'll it'll come very close to doubling in size as well so we've let our dough to ferment and it's been about an hour and 10 to 15 minutes or so pretty happy with the way it looks you can see that it has for the most part doubled in volume could even see kind of where this has created a lot of gas and this when you open the lid you'll actually start to see understand what we talked about on aromas and this as compared to a straight which we did in Prior video this now has a tremendous amount of fermentation we were able to ferment 30% of the flour overnight 16 hours approximately and now an additional hour and a you know 20 minutes and the bulk fermentation it's it's much lighter much area and it actually just it smells fantastic so what we're gonna do is take a little bit dusting flour just to kind of ease it out and we're gonna divide these we have to do a pre shape prior to shaping just take your scraper and just kind of loosen it up all right so what you can see is it's much more lively than what a straight dough is and it has a lot more just kind of overall gas and definitely flavor so all right so we're gonna turn the scale on and I'm gonna scale in grams still but what we are going to do is about seven ounces to two hundred it's about two hundred grams and then also we're gonna shape these out to around fifteen inches reason being I can only do fifteen inches is because that's the depth of the oven I can't really load a baguettes sideways so we can maximize this at about 15 inch amount but if you're to do it a traditional baguettes let's see what you would do at the competition the coupe Demond generally those are going to be at 250 grams total weight which is about nine ounces and anywhere from 50 to 55 centimeters which range is around 20 to 22 and a half inches right this like I said we have to adjust to our oven we are baking at home so you know this is still be just fine all right so my scales and grams and I'm going to scale this at 200 grams approx again you can be smart when you're dividing your dough and kind of cut it into a strip all right and then cut off pieces and again don't cut directly on the scale itself because you can hurt yourself right so that's 200 grams that's it here [Music] all right 200 grams if you have more than one piece why don't you lay it down on the opposite side so those pieces start to come together before you're ready to to appreciate okay so we did finish dividing the dough itself we had 2,500 grams of dough divided into 200 grams each as an individual piece it's a little bit less than what you would normally do for a baguette but you know like I said since the oven is smaller I'm gonna have to adjust the size of the baguette to what we're gonna end up doing but we have to pre shape these first and so if it was sitting like this just flip it over okay only a light amount of flour is necessary we're gonna kind of put it into a little log all right that's it it's only gonna sit like this and it's a very simple free shape we're not doing anything other than just kind of folding it over itself so that we can get this in a position that when we do shape it's going to be much more successful so we had a chance to not only pre-shape but let them relax approximately 15 minutes it's going to give us a chance to just very lightly shape the breads by allowing them to relax as I said these are smaller than a traditional baguette and all that we are going to have is just our little log here okay just a light bit of flour this is our proofing Koosh it's made out of like a kind of a flax linen and they'll proof just easily so very similar to what we did before we're going to fold over I like to kind of use my thumb's to press in okay and now we have our little bit additional log start with one hand in the middle all right and then you're gonna start to with even pressure from all fingers at once so you keep the baguette itself even okay and then you're just gonna kind of taper it a little bit at the ends all right and that's that's really it so a lot of people will proof these either the seam side up and do so to let it dry out a little bit here or you can even dust and put flour on the couch so you can have a kind of a floured top to it and then what we're gonna do is just give a little fold here and we're just gonna keep going through Rebekah's you don't want to spend too much time doing it and honestly the least amount you put pressure on this and least amount of movement the better there's a little bit of stickiness you can just kind of run it through a little flour but you don't want too much because then it starts to slide all over all right so we'll just keep doing this if you did a really good job it's hard to see the scene I push it away from you as I say you can kind of use your thumbs there's a little bit of tackiness it's easier and best to that roll it through but I always leave this area without flour because as I said they will start to dry out and slide and it makes it much more difficult to shape this out all right there we are so what we're going to do is go through each of the baguettes and I'm going to continue to put them on here these are going to proof approximately again 50 minutes or so maybe up to an hour and 10 minutes Baggett's had a chance to prove about an hour an hour and five minutes or so and if you look at these it's a test proof they've had a chance to obviously expand but then what you want to do with your your hand or your finger you give a slight indentation it's there and if it starts to slowly expand out and leave a slight indentation as there is right here okay and you'll see it on the side as well right so for us to be able to load these baguettes as I've done in a prior video I used a sheet pan a little dusting flour on the top here so it slides off we've had the proofing Koosh that has been able to proof these this is a really nice one that I was able to find online and then a transfer peel all right you can't you can but it would not be advisable especially if it's a full-length baguette to pick up a loaf of Baghdad while it's proved so we use what's called a transfer peel instead of buying this online actually got the hardware store bought it for three dollars cut it sanded it and it's much easier to do it that way and then we're also going to need our LOM you know our scoring blade all right so to do so it's going to hold your transfer peel pull back the baguette couche and this is the seam up if you remember so let's first do this if these are just even slightly tacky just to make sure that you're not going to be stuck to anything just do that all right we have a nice little baguette all right same here now we only have space in an oven of this size I can do four maybe six across I'm gonna do four right now what's essential though is that we're gonna score our bread load it steam it and then do it again a second time on the other side of the oven and when you're scoring a baguette it's very essential we're gonna do only three scores on this because of the size of the bread generally it's anywhere from five or six sometimes seven depending on the length but you want it at a relatively flat angle you're only going to use about the top quarter to top third of the tip of the blade all right and you're gonna slide it just kind of give a little sliver into it and it's gonna be at a diagonal like this not across too much and not down the line nearly as much just slight angle coming across like this all right so if you can see they overlap it's gonna be about a third each you want to try to keep it within what I call the shoulders so each score starts and ends within that shoulder all right and it's just gonna be that little flap that's gonna come up like this all right so we'll do the same here the speed of what you do it is always what's helpful and then we're gonna load this into the oven all right a little bit of steam for right now and we will steam more and when we look a second set it baguette but you want to go fast controlled speed actually is what I should say it flipped over flip it back and then over and all you do is just kind of lightly gently bring it up okay the rest will load after this and since I didn't catch it in the beginning I can go back not a big issue [Music] you're loading it also you're trying to do that with quite a bit of speed [Music] all right now it's gonna fill the oven with steam it's gonna be able to develop up and over the bread it's going to help to allow the bread to expand properly over the first few minutes and then the crust will begin to set the steam will evaporate all right right so we had a chance to load and bake all of our baguettes and they turned out quite nice these are not a full-length baguette this is be what you would pretty much call a demi baguette they're about 1314 inches and I'm pretty satisfied with them the the steam on these had turned out quite nice there's a nice golden color to these and you can see that the the scores have opened up nicely and and they've they've pretty much done what they're supposed to do I did have one baguette that did not receive as much steam as the other and it's a good example to show what it means when you don't have steam and why we need to do it okay if you can notice on this it's a much duller color and and it's you know just overall appearance is very flat it didn't get that nice gold and shine and that's indicative of a lack of steam it had enough to expand and baked actually fairly well but a little disappointed on that but the you know the rest of the baguettes have have done nicely and if you noticed we were able to put three scores on normally it's about five on up to seven and a full-length baguette but satisfied overall and it's really just about as simple as it is we make a pre from it the night before mix it doesn't take much on mixing let it ferment shaping takes a little bit of practice but not a whole lot and then then eventually scoring and loading does but that will come with practice just remember to keep your scores within the shoulder of the bread and at a diagonal and they overlap at about a third each score all right so I'd like to say thank you for watching our video and and again subscribe to the channel there's gonna be more and more videos that are gonna be coming that's gonna get more complicated and so the first you know several videos are starting to lay a foundation the next video what you're gonna see is breakdown of what bakers percent is and and it relatively simple explanation as to what it is but it's it's very much necessary to understand when we start to make other breads and then I hope to go into another video after that about ingredients and then bring it back to building up sourdoughs and then going into sourdough bread making all right so I'd like to say thank you and if you would like to follow any of these videos or other references you can see us at Kingdom bread - Tampa com", "Fxdr-nIaKS4": "hi there welcome to the real deal today I'm going to show you an interesting way of making your own French forget at home a low-speed mixing called fermented baguette recipe the easiest process to feed families busy schedule let's get started pour water first into your mixer bowl add flour salt semolina and yeast and mix on low speed for 15 minutes then transfer to into a greased the plastic container and let dough rise at room temperature through about and now when the dough has doubled in volume deflate and round dough into a smooth ball place the dough into the same bowl cover and refrigerate overnight after the resting time put the cold fermented dough on your work surface to come back to temperature for about now golde resting doe is also a practical matter once the dough is mixed and resting for 14 hours or more it is not a big deal and once it is pulled out it takes a couple of hours to get it done transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface without deflating it yet and divided into three seven and a half ounce equal pieces flip over dough skin side down gently deflate and fold each piece of dough down into a rectangle shape cover bread with a wet kitchen towel and let rest for 45 minutes at room temperature bread is alive beautiful after the resting time shape each piece into a 16 inch length forget the size of your baking tray starting with the first one you shaped to shape a baguette it is not complicated give a gentle patting folding and pressing with the heel of your hand as if you were folding a business letter even gate each baguette by rolling it a back and forth on the work surface with both hands over the center of the loaf and walk them out to the ends until the baguette reaches the desired length arrange baguette seam side down cover with a wet kitchen towel and let proof for about an hour or until it has almost doubled in size the last step before baking is to slash the tops of the baguette then carefully slide the non-stick baking mat into the hot baking tray or stone and throw a few ice cubes for the steam and beg bread for about 20 minutes smelling bread coming out of your oven will make your day and by the way like professional if you use baker's couche flax linen proofing cloth and if you want to be more creative or or shaped baguette in a dumped clean kitchen towel and coat them with sesame seeds or poppy seeds this is going to be something look at that crusty creamy crumb and so much flavors homemade French baguette made easy I am Brunel boos thank you for watching and don't forget to subscribe you you", "YA3-xFLfZ-k": "in this video I'm going to be demonstrating how to make a basic baguette that you could easily replicate at home and in future videos we'll go into a more detailed and more advanced technique but if you're new to baking bread this is a great starting point for you and still going to yield a very good baguette that you can make fresh at home now you're always going to want to start with your trusty digital scale that can weigh in grams and has a tare function that allows you to zero out the ingredients also a couple of baguette molds and you can pick these up online around eleven or twelve dollars and also some two inch Hotel pans and I'll put a link to all this stuff in the show notes now between the hotel pans and the baguette molds this is what we're going to use to generate our steam and the initial phases of the baking process and it's this steam that is so important in creating that crackly crust that are so hard to replicate in a home kitchen you're going to start this recipe by weighing out 800 grams of all-purpose or AP flour and you want to make sure that you're using a national brand of all-purpose that has a protein content or a gluten content of around eleven and a half percent now in the US there are some regional southern brands that are formulated for making biscuits and the gluten content is lower around nine to nine and a half percent and it's not appropriate for this recipe next you want to weigh out 520 grams of warm water around 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit and this is going to give us a 65% hydration rate based on the Baker's percentage next weigh out seven grams of active dry yeast and the seven grams active dry yeast is about equivalent to one packet of yeast that you buy in your local supermarket and this will come out to be a little bit less than 1% by the Baker's percentage now our final ingredient is our salt which is going to be 16 grams or 2% by the bakery percentage and always kosher salt I'm going to set the salt aside and going to disperse my yeast into my warm water and this isn't so much to activate it or hydrate it as it is it's just to make sure that it'll be evenly dispersed throughout my flour when I mix the two together my thought is if I have the yeast evenly dispersed throughout the water it'll permeate the flower fairly easily so the next step is to take my water and yeast mixture and or it into the bottom of a mixing bowl I always like to have the water on the bottom and then place the flour on top it just makes the initial combining a lot easier and then I like to use one of these nifty little hand spatulas the little rubber bowl scrapers to combine the flour and water and you can also just get your hands and they're getting nice and dirty and roll that flour and water together until it comes into a shaggy sort of mess the sort of a loose ball of dough and at this point instead of kneading we're actually going to set it aside for a little while placing it in a plastic container that's been sprayed with panelist spray and let it rest for about fifteen to thirty minutes and this is called auto lease and the purpose of auto lease is to allow the flour and the gluten in the flour to hydrate making it a lot easier to knead the don't work with the dough and when the dough is easier to knead you have to knead it for less time and that'll give you a better flavor because the more you knead your dough the more it will oxidize so after that oddities period what you can do is you can do what's called a stretch and fold just like this where you pull that one third of the dough and fold it back in on itself one third of the dough and you fold it back in on itself and I did spray that board a little bit of pain relief spray just to make it a little bit easier to work with and you round the dough as you're going to continue the stretching fold method you would let the dough relax for 20 minutes and come back and do another stretching fold and continue this at 20 minute intervals for about an hour to an hour and 40 minutes and the stretch and fold technique actually allows you to form a gluten network without kneading the dough and it'll give you more larger irregular holes now for the traditional actual kneading method you're going to use the heel of your hand and press the dough outward away from you dusting the board just lightly with flour just as little as possible so the dough doesn't stick and continue that kneading process for a couple of minutes after a couple of minutes you want to add in your kosher salt and the reason why we waited till now is because kosher salt is salt in general well tighten gluten strands and make the dough more difficult to knead at about the 6 minute mark we're going to check our gluten structure by stretching a thin membrane out a piece of dough and you see how it's tearing on me there that shows me that my gluten network where my gluten structure isn't fully developed yet but at this point I'm kind of getting sick of kneading I want a little bit of a break so it's going to spray the board a little bit of panel a spray spray the top cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then I hang out for about five minutes and go relax for a second after that five to ten minute rest you'll notice that the dough is a lot more pliable and easy to work and from here you can give it a couple of stretching fold you can knead it for a couple more minutes and you should be pretty closed in the ballpark of having that nice gluten Network so rip off a piece of dough give a little stretch and it's hard to see with the lighting in this camera shop but basically you're looking for a thin membrane that light shines through which we now have so I'm just going to round the dough and at this point now that my gluten structure is nice and developed it's time to bulk form it so just place it back into a plastic container that's sprayed with a little bit of a pain relief spray or you can rub it with a tiny bit of oil so it doesn't stick and you want to bulk ferment the dough at room temperature and the bulk fermentation is also known as primary fermentation and you want to bulk from it at room temperature for about two to two-and-a-half hours or until the dough has nearly doubled in size at that point it's time to divide and form the way you can do this is very gently turn the dough out onto your working surface that has a little pan release spray on it and be careful not to decompress the gas out of the dough too much and you're going to divide into four pieces and notice how I'm cutting into rectangular shapes that's going to make the baguettes a little bit easier to form and I'm scaling these four pieces to about 330 grams of 340 grams apiece now once you have your dough divided and portioned you onto a preform and the way you do is you take the top third of the rectangle and you fold it into the middle creating a seam with your fingertips right down the middle and then you take the top two-thirds and you roll them back onto the bottom third trading a scene with your fingertips while tucking in the ends and then you can also use your fingertips to seal that seam now commonly what you'll see too is a tension pole just like this where you tuck your fingers along that seam and you drag that seam along your board creating tension on the top of the preformed loaf and it also helps to seal that seem one more time from my perspective just the top third of the dough and then rectangular shape you're gonna fold back on itself create a seam directly down the middle and then roll back to the top two-thirds again and create a seam now you can usually heel of your hand to close that seam up get a little roll and you always want to rest seam side down and this preform is going to allow us to do the next step which is the benching or the bench rest and we're going to bench rest the preform baguettes for about five to ten minutes to allow the gluten structure to relax during this time you can go ahead and spray your baguette molds with a little bit of pain relief spray you know get them ready so you can form your final baguette and just place them right into the mold and then you want to take your preformed baguette which was resting seam side down and turn it steamed side up and then gently press down along that seam with your fingertips slightly decompressing the loaf and elongating it by stretching it out by pulling it from both ends and then you take the top third again you press it into the middle of the dough or the baguette and you seal that seen with your fingertips and then you take the top two-thirds and you roll it back on that Mouse bottom third creating a seam with your fingertips pressing it down as you go and you want to use the heel of your hand to seal that seam so you have a nice tight seam that doesn't explode on you and you bake now if you want to elongate you just simply can roll the dough with your hands a little bit and stretch out any long get out and then you go and find the seam that you had originally and when you find that seam you place that seam in your baguette mold seam side down now if you want to have some pointed ends you can just simply counter twist your baguette and that will give you pointed ends and then elongate it slightly and again you want to find that seam and place it in your baguette mold seam side down now real quick from my perspective again here's our preformed baguette seam side up I'm going to go down the length of the baguette using my fingertips to gently decompress it I don't want to be overly rough here I'm just gently decompressing it and stretching it out slightly and then I want to use the my fingertips to fold back the top third into the middle and create that seem going directly down the middle and in that top two-thirds is going to be rolled back and seamed with the bottom one-third using my fingertips initially and then using the heel of my hand to go back and create that seam now when using the heel of your hand you always want to make sure that your fingers are pointing up towards the ceiling never flat because that way you're gonna if your fingers are flat you're going to crush the dough just going to go down that seam seal that seam with the heel of your hand if you need to you can roll it to elongate it and again you always want to place it seam side down to proof now once you've formed your baguettes you're going to cover them in the hotel pants with your plastic wrap and allow them to proof for about an hour to hour and a half or until they grow to about one and half times their original size at this point it's time to prepare for baking and here I have a sharp Baker's razor and I have it just on a little popsicle stick now when scoring baguettes you want to do it at an extreme angle a little bit less than 30 degrees coming in horizontally and that's what's going to give you the nice little Leafs or ear marks when they expand in the oven and here I'm making three slice marks as I go down the length of the baguette and then I'm going to place some ice cubes in the tray and the ice cube is going to help generate steam when we cover it with tinfoil so I'm going to seal the top of the hotel pan very tightly with tinfoil and then pop this into a 500 degree oven and bake covered for the first ten minutes of the baking process now at this point after the ten minutes you're going to remove the tin foil and you'll notice that when you remove the foil you're going to have some steam bellowing out and that steam is going to help your expansion and again this that's what's responsible for that nice crackly crust when baking a baguette I'm going to drop the oven down to 425 or 400 degrees depending upon your oven and bake for about another 10 minutes and I'm going to check them rotate them top to bottom and turn the pans 180 degrees and then from here bake at another anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes again depending upon your oven and you want to make sure you get a really nice dark golden brown color because the bottom because you're using baguette molds the bottom of the baguette won't brown as much the top so you want to compensate for that by getting a nice golden brown top to really extract the full flavor of the flower now from here you want to allow your baguettes to cool for about 40 minutes before slicing and when you slice into this you'll notice that you have somewhat of an irregular crumb when you squeeze that crush it's going to crackle and crunch which is really what makes this technique important with using the steam and the crumb itself is somewhat irregular not as much as if we would have done the entire process with the stretch in full technique but that's a little bit more advanced so we're going to cover a stretch and fold a little bit more advanced process for making baguettes and a follow-up video to this but suffice to say nothing beats a nice homemade fresh baguette straight from your oven for sandwiches and soups and just dinner in general for more information and for this episode shownotes head owner to Stella : comm

videos okay this recipe is for those who are finding my original bucket video a bit too time-consuming to take on now this bucket method shaves over an hour and a half off the other recipe by using what's known as the police or sponge method all this means is you have to spend five minutes making up the police a few hours before you begin the actual bucket recipe usually the night before and here is a list of the simple ingredients you'll need to make up the police it's also known as a sponge or a starter right I'll start the police by adding a half a teaspoon of dried yeast to the strong white bread flour and whisk that in the next and last ingredient is the cold water and I'll give that a thorough whisk now the measurements for this and any of my recipes really are carefully worked out so please use digital skills and get to know grams it is so much more accurate than ounce and cup of measurements right once that's done cover the ball and get it under the top shelf of the fridge now the reason for the top shelf is it's the warmest part of the fridge sort retards or slows the fermentation down to a steady rate and it's that slow fermentation that gives this bread its fantastic flavor very much like my ciabatta recipe okay it's it I was later and it's the next morning for me and it's time to start making these baguettes and here's a list of the rest of the ingredients including the police that I made up yesterday now after it I was mine looks like this but if yours has been in longer and it looks like this one don't worry it's fine this test one that I did was in my fridge for 24 hours you can see it is risen and then sunk again but as long as this bubbles it's okay right add the water to the police and give it a good whisk up now set that aside for a moment while I mix the flour and the salt in a separate ball [Music] [Music] now at the polish mixture and give it a good mix until it all comes together into a sticky door as always I'll be using the handle of my wooden spoon to do mine don't be tempted to you Shi whisk at this point the door is way too thick for that tool you can use a stand mixer but only until the door comes together but mixing it by hand only takes a couple of minutes right don't forget to scrape down any dried flour from the sides of the ball and cover and set the timer for the first of only two 45 minute rises and that is where you see at the time from my original bucket video by making the police you only need two 45 minute Rises instead of fall now these times may slightly vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen the ambient temperature in my kitchen is 23 Celsius that's 74 Fahrenheit which is ideal for proofing this door and after the first 45 minutes you can see how much the door has risen slightly wet the bench before turning it out this will stop the door from sticking to the worktop and with wet hands give the door a few turns this is called knocking the door back or degassing it also distributes the temperature evenly throughout the door notice how much smoother the door looks now get it back into the ball cover and set your timer for a second and last 45 minute rise [Music] okay while waiting for the door to rise I'll get a couple of things ready starting with the baker's couche all this is is a well floured piece of material to proof the baguettes on I use the 100% cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the proper baker's couche material and it does exactly the same job you'll also need a slightly oiled strip of cling film or plastic rub this is to cover the pre shaped buckets a little later set that aside for now now flour the worktop preferably next to the Koosh cloth and have your digital skills ready to divide the door accurately [Music] okay once the time's up carefully turn out the door onto the floured surface [Music] once the doors on the bench dust it with flour and start dividing it into however many buckets you're making out of this recipe you'll either get four large six medium or eight small now providing your measurements were correct at the start the adorn should we twelve hundred and twenty grams of forty three ounces I'm making six medium baguettes out of mine so each piece of door works out at two hundred and three grams or just over seven ounces each now the next step is to prep the buckets and let them rest a while this will relax the door and make forming the final bugger chip much easier rather than me try to explain it'll be easier if you just watch and copy how I'm doing it [Music] [Music] once they're all done cover them with the oiled cling film and set the timer for 15 minutes [Music] [Music] once the 15 minutes is up start forming the buckets you'll find the door is much easier to handle after it's been relaxing for a while now once again I'll let you watch how it's done I'll go slowly through the first couple to give you an idea but the best and only way to learn is to practice [Music] once each pocket is font lift it over to the cush and lay them out as Sean [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] once all the buckets are on the couch cover them with a lightweight dry tea towel or dish cloth and let them proof for 30 minutes [Music] when there's only ten minutes left on the proofing time pre-heat your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 446 Fahrenheit or gas mark eight you'll also need to place upon a hot water on the bottom shelf or the other this will create a steamy atmosphere in the oven which makes the baguettes crispy one more thing you'll need is a spray bottle of water standing by for a little later okay [Music] once the 30 minutes are up carefully transfer the buckets to a very lightly oiled baking tray or trays I'm using two trays three buckets on each you'll have to decide what we are using depending on what size buckets you're making [Music] once the buckets are on the tree I'll give them a quick squirt with the water and with a very sharp knife or razor blade score the buckets are Shawn I'm giving these three scores on each one [Music] right I'll quickly go through the second dot [Music] and now get them straight into the preheated oven once they're in give the oven a quick squirt with water before closing the door this will make these baguettes even crispier once they're safely in the oven I'll set the timer for 16 minutes after about 10 minutes I'll be swapping mine around top to bottom and back to front this is for even cooking okay that's the 16 minutes up and mine are done this is how we like them but if you prefer yours a bit darker just give them a little longer but check them every two minutes the last thing you want after all this effort is to burn them [Music] and there they are six delicious light crispy baguettes made at home the smell in my kitchen is amazing and just listen to how crispy these are wonderful okay I'll cut one open and have a look on the inside now what you can see the crumb are bubbles are not as large as my other French baguette recipe but still perfectly acceptable I'll add some of my homemade butter and have a little taste test [Music] and just as all my senses would tell me this is a delicious bread and definitely gets a thumbs up for another quicker baguette video recipe well thank you again for watching please like share comment and subscribe by hitting a circle above if he do subscribe

some sourdough baguettes this is a formula which is actually in the professional section of our website but i've adopted it thank goodness for you and i working at home and i think the results are really good so stick around for the video [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] do so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] okay looks pretty good it's uh the color is good it opened pretty well i really like the texture on the exterior i dusted the koosh the cloth the linen with a little bit of that freshly milled coarse sand or kamut and when it bakes it toasts a little bit and also gives it just this extra added little hit of texture i think it looks pretty good let's see what it looks like inside which is kind of like the true test yeah we're not going to argue with that that's what it should look like this is kind of what we strive for little fingertip size bubbles throughout what that does is it really opens the texture it changes the eating quality so that when you're eating it's almost like lighter it's this like airy pocket held by crumb and a crust on the outside it's it's really what makes baguettes delicious exterior looks really nice and crusty almost like eggshell like like really thin and and crisp [Music] plenty of crust the acidity is really light it's there but it's not like a sourdough it's just sort of a little bit of brightness and a little bit of like extra bready flavor super nutty i need to get some butter yeah so there it is a nice uh crusty sourdough baguette and stick around and we're gonna go through the formula cheers [Music] okay so let's go through this baguette [Music] so before we get into it i wanted to just show you that if you come to the king arthur website and you type baguette in the search window there are a lot of options you don't have to make the formula that i made in the video what i want is mostly for you to just see the methods and techniques that i use which can be applied to many many different types of baguettes so on the website lots of options shapes and sizes different flowers now the recipe that i used is in the professional section so down at the bottom of the page for professional bakers bakery formulas and sourdough baguettes now this is sized for a bakery that's making larger batch sizes it's also with instructions that are for commercial mixers and those things so what i'm interested in are the ingredients the percentages the quantity of pre-fermented flour and maybe dough temperature also also bulk fermentation how much bulk roughly so those are the things that i'm going to sort of take and then i'm going to put them into excel this is where i end up so i brought the percentages over 90 all-purpose 10 percent fresh mold core sand you'll notice in the bakery formula that it has high extraction flour i don't have high extraction and it can be harder to come by so i used some chorus sand which i'm able to get in bulk at the local food co-op whatever but you could also use bagged whole wheat flour i used that at 10 percent i like the core sand because it's really yellow it's actually the cousin of durum which is used to make pasta so it's very yellow and super flavorful ninety percent all-purpose ten percent fresh milled coruscant 73 water the 73 water could go up a little bit just depends on how thirsty mostly how thirsty this fresh milk core sand is or the whole wheat flour that you use is and for that ten percent you could use a lot of different things you could use medium rye you could use whole rye you could use spelt you could use um just about any type of whole grain flour that's going to add flavor so 73 and like i said could go up or down depending on how thirsty your flour is 2 salt a little bit of sourdough culture and a small amount of yeast you know some people are going to quibble about it's a sourdough baguette you can't add yeast no you can it's okay there's yeast in the sourdough culture sourdough culture has yeast in it it's a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast so adding a little bit of commercial yeast is not going to hurt anything it's only only going to help ensure that things ferment at a steady rate it's okay don't be too uptight about that so total formula is here my batch is five baguettes at 300 grams for a total of 1500 grams so you'll see some of all parts right here 1500 grams it has a liquid le van and that's 15 percent of the pre-fermented flour 15 of the pre-fermented flour a little bit of sourdough culture to get things started we mix that and let it ripen overnight 12 to 15 hours and then it goes into the final mix so let's look at the method so set the preference and then the mix is mix flower salt yeast which is optional you don't have to use it if you decide not to use it make sure that you have a nice healthy 11 going and you may need to add a little bit of time to your bulk fermentation you're just going to have to kind of feel your way through that and look for signs of activity so i mixed to combine i'm hoping for 74 75 degrees fahrenheit if you've got a cold house you're going to want to watch that bulk fermentation because if you get a 74 or 75 and the room is 62 by the end of bulk you may have a dough that's only 65 degrees or cooler so you want to make sure that you leave it in a warm place and don't let it lose too much temperature or you're going to need to extend bulk a little bit okay i was able to do three hours of bulk fermentation and i just did three folds i say three to four here um trying to find the balance between developing strength and not having too much strength and in this case i only ended up needing three folds i needed three folds only i did try it with four and the structure wasn't as good it wasn't as open and so i went back to three and i got a better result you may find in your house with your hands and your flower and your activity level of your 11 that you may go up to four it's okay so after three hours i divided and pre-shaped the cylinders and then rest for about 15 minutes until they felt like they would be extensible and then shape and at the shaping you'll see me roll it through some of the freshly milled chorus and i really like that texture on the outside and i mentioned it in the video it adds flavor it adds beauty it adds texture it's all the things that i want and then i baked after about an hour so actually a quick tip here so i allowed the doughs to rise for about an hour and then i put them into the fridge for about 15 minutes or so just to cool them down and it helps to make them score more easily if they're a little bit cool so i gave them a little bit of time in the fridge right before baking and that's a good tip for baguettes and for some other things too so those went into a 500 degree oven for about 20 25 minutes depending on you know your oven and always with steam always always with steam so that's pretty much it sourdough baguettes you don't have to do this one you can do the formula that is on the website my hope like i said is that you can use the methods that i showed you on the video like how i shape how i divide how i shape the cylinders before shaping how i score that you can use those techniques and apply them to many of the baguettes on the website baguettes are about as hard as it gets for bread at home so be patient with yourself keep practicing and i wish you lots of luck and delicious crisp crusty flavorful [Music] baguettes [Music]

at checkout to get 10% off we're gonna do a single portion of dough in a small sealable container glass is best the acid in the dough could draw harmful chemicals from plastic and some metals certainly aluminum in goes half a cup of water than like a pinch of yeast maybe an eighth of a teaspoon at most then half a teaspoon of salt no matter what anyone tells you that will not kill the yeast and it's easier to integrate evenly if you add it to the water instead of the flour one cup of bread flour and grab a silicone spatula and use that to just bring this together this is a no need bread dough if you're looking for a recipe with precise measurements look elsewhere here's how to judge the hydration of this by eye it should be just wet enough that it has no visible dry patches just wet enough if it does have visible dry patches then add a little bit of water and that spray bottle is a great way of adding a tiny little bit there we go it's wet enough that it kind of glistens all over but it's still pretty firm cover this up some people say you need to leave a gap in the seal so the yeast can breathe but I've never noticed a difference okay you probably can't bake this today if you want bread as soon as tomorrow let it sit out most of the day until it's really noticeably risen like that and then toss it in the fridge overnight which is what we're gonna do this time the best way to do it however is to mix it up and throw it straight into the fridge for many days a week even no counter rise the longer and slower the rise the better the flavor and you could stack up a whole bunch in there and have dates written on them so you can have bread any time in our case we did a table rise followed by the fridge and now it's the next day and grab a baking sheet and lay on a piece of parchment paper and grab your super sticky dough out of the fridge and rather than flour your hands just get them wet water can be a perfectly effective lubricant peel it out of the container while deflating it as little as possible this is way easier if it's and just stretch it out into a log that's as long as your baking sheet is diagonally no complicated folding or shaping procedures just stretch it out and put it on to the parchment you might be thinking isn't that gonna stick to the parchment without any flour or anything yes it is and we're counting on that give it a spray to keep the top from drying out and just let it sit out uncovered for an hour hour and a half don't expect it to proof up a ton but it should look a little puffier before you bake the fact that the dough sticks hard to the parchment prevents it from spreading out really flat and it forces some of its rise upward it's like using a Koosh except zero work heat your oven to 500 Fahrenheit convection if you've got it and when it's good and hot throw your tray in right in the middle and spray it with a ton of water I'm spraying both the bread and the walls of the oven this replicates the effect of professional steam injection ovens without bothering to put a pan of boiling water or something in the bottom you want to open it up and spray it again every minute or two for the first few minutes this keeps the outside of the bread from setting up hard before it gets a chance to oven spring that's when steam builds up inside the dough and pops it up giving you a nice open structure basically whenever I see the dough has gone visibly dry I spray it again every minute or two until it seems to have puffed up as much as it's gonna puff like ten minutes after it went in then you could stop spraying it if you want but I like to keep spraying every four or five minutes because that gets you a really shiny crust one of the advantages of laying the dough down diagonally is it makes it really easy for you to reach in there and spray the back of the loaf if you're not sure when it's done you could always take its temperature pull it when the internal temp is 190 to 200 Fahrenheit but I find that when the crust is deep amber it's done that one took 22 minutes I'm sure your times will vary when it's cool enough to touch you can just peel it off the parchment paper and look at that between the very wet no need dough and the fact that we didn't do any complex shaping work this is still flatter than a baguette but who's to say that's a bad thing in the mirror universe where this happened to develop as the traditional method me with a goatee is probably saying yeah you know this newfangled baguette thing doesn't get you that same flat look that tradition really demands but it's an OK substitution long live the Empire all right let's slicer open audibly thin crispy crust and even down there in the thinnest part we've got an open fluffy structure I am totally jumping on the no-knead bandwagon water and time achieved basically all the same chemical and biological effects that you get from traditional methods don't get excited that's not white wine it's Vinho Verde pretty much the only white ish wine I actually drink now if only I had some cheese dry sausage and homemade pickles and well would you look at that now if only I had a cheese knife and well would you look at that makes this a perfect grab and go situation for a party or a picnic thanks again to Vistal supply for sponsoring this video get 10% off this board with my link and code in the description those homemade pickles by the way easiest sweet pickle ever whole 12 ounce bottle of rice vinegar goes into a glass bowl then as much sugar as you can dissolve into it cold about a cup or less if you don't like them too sweet chop up a couple cups of veggies I'm doing cauliflower green beans and radishes pickled cauliflower is delicious but be warned it's kind of stinky throw that covered into the fridge for at least a day and man that is just one of my favorite meals and that lazy loaf has a better flavor and texture than anything I can buy in my little town if you have an awesome French bakery down the street don't bother but if you're on your own like me give this a shot let me know how it goes", "Tq2aDik3vZY": "[Music] when you divide and pre-shape for baguette it's important that you cut your dough into a nice square piece so first i'll start out by cutting off a strip of dough that is about four inches wide and cut the dough into a square as i'm shooting for about 350 grams so at the end i want to have about four by four square pieces [Music] okay start with a square piece gently pat it down fold it once and twice and when i fold i have my fingers together so that way this creates a straight line and then fold press gently away to create a pressure tighten the skin okay so make sure that your dough is not sticking to the table gently pat it down without using your fingertip fold now have your fingers lining up like this so that way it creates this straight line that you can fold and press gently down and away to create a little bit of tension here same way press gently away for the tightness of the skin now when you do this you should have your elbows facing out so that you can line your fingers like this if your elbows are closed you end up poking with your fingertips which will then break the skin okay here's the final shaping for your baguettes okay first take your pre-shape seam side up and gently flatten down with your hand create a flat surface and first fold in about one third so that way you're creating a seam in the middle okay so it's the same motion as the pre-shape for the one-third turn it around and fold my left hand is folding and ceiling with the heel of my hand fold and seal fold and seal just enough pressure so that way the dough adheres to each other so you have a straight line down in the middle and we're going to fold this one more time from the seam fold in half and seal seal okay and when you seal make sure that your heel of your hand is square to your bucket if you chop it on the side of your hand then it's going to make this dent on the surface roll from the center first slide in one hand and then slide in your next hand make a big movement zig zag okay and find your seam place on the cush seam side up okay and make a fold on the crush okay one more time flatten down slide your hand underneath just like the pre shape fold about one third and seal gentle pressure downward to seal create a seam in the middle rotate fold with your left hand and seal fold and seal and fold in half the seam is formed right down here okay and start with one hand now if you start with two then you may end up having this little bump in the center slide one hand and then the next one and make a big movement with your arm move from your shoulder not just your wrist even pressure all the way to the end okay and then seam facing up okay and on the cush you want to give a little bit of room around your baguette so that way they can grow but then the koosh and the by placing the baguette right next to each other that will help sort of grow against each other and support the structure of the look on the board you can fit about six to seven baguettes at a time", "Su_Qw12B2Jo": "Hello, Today I\u2019m showing you how to bake The Traditional French Bread La Baguette Let\u2019s go. *Traditional French Bread*\n[Music] You can knead with a small kneading machine. or just with your hands. Then, you need a digital probe thermometer. It\u2019s very important to take the dough\u2019s temperature. A dough scraper, A dough cutter A bread lame. Some water and a pastry brush. A baker cloth, to grow the dough. And an oven to bake the bread. That\u2019s it. Let\u2019s start kneading. *Ingredients*\n[Music] And for the ingredients: 500g of Classic French Flour 100g of our liquid sourdough starter 330g of water, If you are brave, you can add a bit more water, but know that it will be bit more difficult to manage the dough. but, the bread will be even more beautiful. 9g of salt And 4g of fresh baker\u2019s yeast. *The recipe*\n[Music] I\u2019m giving you a first tip to bake a beautiful bread. Stir together the 500g of flour and the 330g of water. You can pour the whole water in. But, if you knead with your hands, you\u2019ll have to pour the water slowly. The autolyse is completed after several minutes of kneading, Now, we leave the dough to rest. Put a baker\u2019s cloth on the kneading machine for an hour. *Rest: 1 hour* And then, we\u2019ll start kneading again with the yeast, the salt and the levain. And we add the liquid levain. Normally you would take a spatula. But I like to use my hands to feel the energy of the sourdough starter. You should learn to feel a lot with your hands in this job. And we start to knead for 6 - 7 minutes. *Kneading: 6 to 7 minutes\" And here is the dough of the traditional French bread. The kneading is done. I\u2019m putting it down a towel. I\u2019m taking its temperature. *Temperature: 23\u00b0C*\nIt is very important to have a dough around 23\u00b0C-24\u00b0C. It means that the dough is at the right temperature for the perfect fermentation. Then, we\u2019ll let it rest for at least 1 hour for it to build up its strength. *First Rising: 1 hour\"\nIts ferments carbon dioxide are released. You can see some thin bubbles at the surface of the dough. This first fermentation is very important. That\u2019s is what we call the first rise or first fermentation. The more your dough ferments the better it will taste. I cut the dough in three with my dough cutter. We\u2019re going to make some round balls, it is called pre-shaping the bread. The method is very simple: fold the edges in towards the centre. I\u2019m about to give it a round shape. *Second Resting: 30 min*\nSee, a nice round ball. *Second Resting: 30 min*\nLet it rest for at least 30 minutes. *The Shaping*\n[Music] Take some flour and lightly flour the work surface. I put my hand in the flour and slightly press the round loaf. Do not degas the loaf too much, we need the gas formed inside the loaf. It will turn into alveoli when the bread will be baked. I roll out the loaf a little bit. I\u2019m folding the loaf. I\u2019m rolling the baguette. It easily gets longer. I\u2019m putting it on the baker\u2019s cloth (or couche) Seams above *Proofing: 2 hours\"\nI cover the dough and leave to proof for 2 hours. *The baking*\n[Music] Just before putting the baguettes in the oven, pour a glass of water in it. It will create steam that will help the bread to rise longer in the over. The bread will bake for 22-23 minutes at 250\u00b0C. And you\u2019ll have something splendid to share at home.

enemies when me actually has two different kinds you have one that has a thicker crust and a denser interior as opposed to the recipe that I will be sharing with you today has more of a super thin crust that is super crispy and the interior is very light and fluffy so if you want to take a look at this and listen to the sound that crispy sound just makes me want to salivate so this is the type of Bend me that you find most commonly at the sandwich shops it is very very light in weight when you look at the bun me it looks big but when you're holding it in your hand it's just super feather-light and you can tell why by looking at the interior of this sandwich here the dough itself has risen to the point where you have these super structures of nice gluten formations is so stretchy which is actually a classic traditional expectation of a Vietnamese bun me so to be able to get one of these and successfully make one of these at home there's quite a few details and tips that I will be providing in this video and I do hope and want you to successfully make this the very first time so just make sure that you are paying attention to the different points that I give throughout the video so if you want to make this let's get started we are using bread flour today and one question that comes up in a lot of my bread video from my subscriber is that can you use all-purpose flour in place of the bread flour and the answer is yes it's just not preferred because the all-purpose flour does not contain enough protein to be able to have that nice gluten formation so don't improve ER is something I don't typically use in my bread recipe but I am using it today in this particular recipe because it does need that to help with the structure of this type of bread the yeast that we are using today is instant yeast so if you do not have instant yeast and you are using active dry yeast you do have to use the water in this recipe to activate the yeast before you add it to the flour we will be needing a little bit of salt to add a dimension of flavor to the sandwich and we will be balancing it out with just a little bit of sugar so butter is not something that you typically find in a bunny recipe but for me it is really important to get this Airy fluffy texture to this recipe you don't need much you only need about two tablespoons which is equivalent to about thirty gram vitamin C gives a very aesthetic environment and the yeast love that and you don't need much just a pinch you can crush a tablet and also one whole egg the egg also does what the butter kind of does which really helps to fluffing up that dough and gives it an easier environment for it to rise water is really just water from the cold faucet it's not ice-cold water or it's not warm water it's just regular water that you get from the sink let's go ahead and combine everything we have a flower here and to it I'm adding the dough improver along with the sugar as well as the salt we will also be placing the pinch of that vitamin C in here and then we will be giving this a quick mix and just until everything is combined this is the butter that I have melted and we will be placing that into the flour here you can just also add that to the water and add it to the flour either way will work but once everything is mixed we will be placing our yeast now remember this is dry instantly so if you are using the active dry make sure that you bloom it in this water here until it's fully from foamy before you add it to the flour will also place in our one whole egg and today we will be using a dough hook with a stand mixer to knead this dough I am going to provide you with the speed as well as the timing the first couple minute or - you can just put it on stir or number - just until everything is fully combined and hooked on to your dough hook at that point increases speed to number six we will be needing this for a total of ten minutes on number six and let's take a look at the dough this is at the three minute mark we will be comparing the dough and the way it looks at the three minute the six minute and that at the ten minutes so here at the three minutes you can see the dough is kind of falling off the hook very easily it tears pretty easily as well what we want to do is we want to create a super elastic dough let's continue to knead this and then I will stop the machine when it gets to six minutes to show you what it looks like in six minutes so the whole purpose of creating a super elastic dough is so that it can trap the air easier so even when your dough Rises really poufy it can still retain that trapped air without causing it to collapse so here we are at six minutes as you can see the dough is still falling off the hook but it's starting to look a lot smoother and not as tacky so we'll go ahead and put it on number six again and let's knead it for another four minutes now depending on your KitchenAid or the the standard type of mixer that you use you may need a little bit less time or a little bit more time key point is whenever you get to this stage here is where you need to stop so as you can see as I'm pulling apart yes it is sticking to my finger that's okay it's it's going to be sticky what's more important is you spread the dough you will see how smooth the dough is it's just super smooth you can totally tell how elastic this is so let's go ahead and remove the dough grease a large bowl with either oil or butter and you want to place them in your hand as well so you can work with the dough a lot easier now no too when I am removing the stone you can tell how tough this dough is it's just super elastic again so for this type of on me and my recipe here the dough has to be like this for this to work otherwise if you don't create this plastic elastic dough when the dough starts to rise it is going to collapse and you are going to end up having super dense than me so when you're rolling this into a ball just make sure that you are forming a smooth surface this smooth surface is going to end up being the outermost layer of the crust and the smoother it is the more glossy your bread is going to be go ahead and place it back into the greased bowl and add a little bit more oil or butter to the top of this dough we will cover this up with plastic wraps and we will let it rise until it's about double or two-and-a-half times the original size every kitchen is different for me it takes about 30 minutes but essentially this is kind of what you're looking for if you want to use exact oil that I'm using as a reference that would be easier for you I will drop the link in the description box below along with all of the ingredients for this recipe go ahead and grease the working surface and dump out the dough and when you dump out the dough make sure that the top smooth layer stays on the bottom for this recipe I can make six bread but if you want smaller you just wait the entire dough and divide it into how many many ever pieces you want now note here I want to show you the edge of where I just cut can you see how smooth this is which means that this is so elastic that all the air that has been created from fermentation and the yeast working is able to trap in there without creating super a huge pocket that would have collapsed if we didn't do that when we pour out the dough so once you have them all either eyeballed and into cut into six pieces or use a scale and divide it up to your liking and place them all to the side and I will start walking you through the step and how to shape these dough into the traditional shape of and me when shaping these but me you always want to keep the smooth surface on the bottom because eventually that is going to be on top when you start rolling the dough inward so you want to take the piece of dough and just Mack it on the counter this will help to release a lot of the air and also it will give you the pointy tip where it will be helpful to start to roll the dough in and create this little larger area in the middle of Europe and me when you're rolling it make sure that you are pinching the side of the dough while pushing backward a little bit and at the end of the piece of dough just make sure that you flatten it pretty well so that I can stick to the dough a lot easier go ahead and bake place that onto your baking tray I'm going to show you one more time with a close-up so again the smooth side goes on the bottom slap the piece of dough onto the counter a couple of times you can even use a rolling pin to roll out the end of this dough to make that flat surface now only with the flat area stay on to the dough better when you roll it in but it can also help to create that then little thin crust that you are looking for so again look here if you're rolling it just pinch the side and pull it backward pinch push backward pinch push backward and just continue like that I'm going to move the camera here so I can show you the rest of it and you can see the tighter you rolled as the butter is going to trap that air and then that flat area it just sticks to the back of the bun me so well once all of them have been rolled out and shaped go ahead and grease it again and cover with the towel and we're going to rest that in the meantime we'll preheat the oven to 400 and ten degrees every ovens a little different so keep an eye on your bread make sure it doesn't get too browned base Venna me spend me requires a water trade to create steam the water trade goes on the lowest rack and the bread goes in the middle rack so this is the dough that's been rested for one hour in my kitchen it is super big fluffy and if you touch the dough it is not flimsy at all it actually has so much structure to it we will be spraying the surface with water so that when we start making the slashes and creating that classic look of the bunny that it the bread doesn't give the razor a hard time if it's if a straw is going to make this process really difficult you want to use a razor go at a 45-degree angle from top to bottom along the bread very nice and easy as you're seeing here so 45 degree angle top to bottom and just make one nice cut do that with all of the bread you don't want to cut too deep because that is going to cause your bread to spread really really big so just a very nice cut not too thick at all once you have made the cut go ahead and spray at the openings with more water to keep that area moist when it goes into the oven to help allow for even better oven spring so I want to kind of give you a close-up on what it should look like because the stove was so elastic so even with the dough the the how much it has risen it can trap all the air in there if it was not an elastic dough this entire thing would have collapsed so we will be baking this for 24 minutes I guess between 22 to 24 just really depends on your oven but two minutes into the baking process you want to open up the oven and use that water the spray bottle and spray the bread a little bit more the whole purpose here is to keep the bread cooler so it will allow the interior to kind of heat up and help it expand a lot more so this is the finish bread and you don't see the water tray in there anymore because you need to remove the water tray when there's 10 minutes left of bacon so that the bread can get golden brown look at these bread they are super super huge when the pizza dough was so small and it's gotten so big to wear all the sides of the bread are touching and it took up the entire space of this baking tray yeah so that's that's why it's so important to create that elastic dough and you can tell here just by the way it has expanded the bread you can tell that is super fluffy in the inside and super Airy you want to go ahead and just add some butter to it so he can give you a very nice gloss okay let me go ahead and cut this bread up so you guys can see how fluffy lian area is in the inside and if you like what you see I hope you will consider sharing this video with your friends your families your loved ones I think it's amazing to be able to have fresh baked and me just right out of the oven and serving it to your loved ones as a matter of fact I've been baking me for my mother for the past couple years just because we live so far from anywhere that we can actually buy but me so

the studio today and we're gonna make epi delay which is a decorative baguette and the formula we're using for the dough is our classic backend [Music] all right so we're going to make epi tablet and what is that epi do bleh in French means like Shiva bleep or stock of week so if you think about how wheat grows in the field you have the grains that are sort of offset and so this is a decorative or edible sort of representation of that right you've seen these scissor cuts before right okay so you know the decorative baguettes is really big there are many many many shapes that we could do that would be really pretty it's such a broad category that the world cup of baking it's an entire category of skills evaluation is decorative baguette so anyway we're gonna do one that's super common and people ask about it a lot which is at the diplay okay and we have somebody new behind the camera today we have Clementine Philip and she's filling in for anthem and thank you Clementine come on in here and have a look so these are baguettes that are shaped earlier and again this is the classic bag yet recipe they are proofing these are proofing seam up and then I have some seated ones and I'll talk about those in just a second but for now let's get these [Music] a little bit of flour on top of these it's gonna help with the contrast so when they bake and darken they're gonna this is gonna accentuate the visual contrast so a little bit of flour Oh see if I can get one engine you want to be very delicate with the quantity of dusting flour that you use because it's very it very quickly goes from looking natural to looking unnatural and we want this to look natural it's just a very light dusting and you can even spread it a little bit just to make sure that it doesn't look like it was dusted yeah we dust the seeded ones with the test dust bees yeah we you gently take your hand and just sort of smooth that and while you do that I'm gonna start cutting okay for scissors I'm just using like a nice fabric scissor set of scissors a large light kitchen shear that is kind of blocky won't do as nice and a job so I'm right-handed so I like to cut from left to right and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold the scissors at it's even below 45 some people say 45 degrees I'm even a little bit lower than 45 degree angle to the dough a mistake that people make often is that they use two vertical of an angle and then it looks too tubular we want it to be a low angle which gives this nice long teardrop form to the shape and so do you see how that looks like wheat when wheat grows it has these little spikelets and they're very pointy and so that looks kind of like it should right do another one here again nice low scissor angle and how many did I do one two three four five if you practice it some you'll get to where you kind of do the same number of cuts I'm used to cutting a little bit longer like bakery length baguette than this but I think that that looks like an appropriate number of cuts for this shape you certainly use scissors before okay right okay so again nice low blade angle and I'm not cutting all the way through did you see that you see I'm not cutting all the way through because I want these pieces to remain attached right so nice long a little bit late angle and as I kind of move them left and right like that right and you know another thing you can do is you if you want to a pretty shape also is you can go all in the same direction which can be really pretty it almost makes it looks like look like it wraps around right and then when I do that I go back and tuck in the tips just a little bit okay just tucked in pretty well okay so let's load these and then come back and you're gonna help me with [Music] one note so I put seeds on the exterior of these the sesame EPI or the sesame baguette is one of my favorite things to eat it's so darn good when it bakes the sesame seeds toast and that combined with the baguette is one of my favorite things so I wanted to just quickly show you how do you do a seed tray or how do you get that quantity of seeds onto there so the way that I do that is I use a seed tray now sometimes you'll see people spray Lowe's and then sprinkle you don't get the coverage that you will get if you do it like this and what I've done here is I have a tray with a wet cloth on it and then I have another tray with the seeds on it so what I do is I shape the loaf and then I roll it across the wet cloth and then I go through the seeds and it gives it this great great like large amount of coverage to the loaf you can see how thick the seeds are right works really well it's like the best way a seed coat to anything so you ready to try yes yes okay so you remember basically what I said right so yes kind of a low blade angle meaning you know you're not up here but you kind of down yeah cutting back and forth and don't cut through the entire thing and if you do you know what it's okay don't don't fret about it just like that yeah perfect and then push it to one side okay yep and you can cut even a little bit more through it you know what I mean a little bit yeah you can go a little bit lower keep going no that actually looks great on you keep yelling okay just keep going and if you do it a little bit quicker you'll have less a chance of sticking that's gonna be beautiful look how even they are just watch your fingers as you cut yeah yeah yep keep moving you should smell yeah you did small one so that's okay it's gonna be beautiful look how beautiful that is these are really good if you tear off the pieces like if you put it down on a table that's perfect let's see go ahead and do this one may not put a little bit of flour on there just so it doesn't stick [Music] very good now you get to the end you can go back and source it up let's see does anybody you know does anybody look funky is everything okay it's a little bit sticky that's a little sticky but I think you did really well okay I do this one if you do it you know a couple thousand ten thousand times it gets to where it's just something where your hands do it without thinking you know okay [Music] so the these are out and come on in here Clint ugh so you can get a closer shot they colored really well the cuts are nice and even yours look beautiful look how beautiful our lows came out I love how many cuts you did yeah it's really pretty it's it's even closer visually to representing what the wheat looks like in the field so that's super beautiful they're crispy this is perfect a couple of these on the table for a nice dinner and you can pass them around and pull out the piece so we used the classic baguette recipe for this if you haven't seen that we actually have a video of us making that in this very kitchen go check that out and then you can't make the EPI to bleh which is just the shade so thanks Clementine thanks Arlo you guys be well and we'll see you again soon [Music]", "SSWMYKtzpsY": "welcome to let me be steadily shall we begin okay so three cups how much is that milliliter quadrant muscle how many loose will this make to to bigots to filling with something yeah 337 and forty degrees so 40 degrees basically no forty degrees perfect hey penny put start with this East it's one teaspoon per cup so this is one in a bit too because it's one teaspoon per cup of flour hello principal flour okay we can just leave that for 10 minutes mm-hmm and in ten minutes we can add it in the flour almost 10 minutes it's nice and activated and we can put it in the mixture stir it until it's kind of you know all mixed together okay nicely we've got a nice dough so now we're going to leave it to rise yes so you either core it gonna cover it with the wet cloth or I'm going to cover it with some sylvain oh because I want to see rice so one hour 30 minutes it yeah 101 30 minutes a tray with one centimeter of water in it preheat that for 15 minutes before putting the bread alright so now that the doers risen on the wood board lightly floured I'll make the bigot flow this is well it's easier to take it okay so make sure make sure it's well floured everywhere and abruptly on the treadmill James I like is still thought yeah all right know this if you wanted to write properly it's good to do some some slash [Music] a little bit of flour and we get to go in the oven for 20 minutes look at that all right it's the trick is to see if it's going to actually come off the tray but yes it does that's why it's really important to put as much flour as possible on the tray otherwise it might stick yeah there you go crispy and probably enough very nice insight it's absolutely perfect [Music]", "-9DrwXYCICg": "we're going to make baguettes today the recipe I'm using comes straight out of the book how to make bread by Emanuel  Andrea one of the many great recipes in his book the instructions are pretty straightforward it starts with mixing up a pre ferment called a poolish the night before and then continuing in the morning making a poolish couldn't be simpler in this case we're adding a gram of instant yeast to 125 grams of all-purpose flour and then mixing that into 125 grams of warm water you'll find all the ingredients and measurements on our website so you don't have to make note of them now and this will sit covered overnight this is the poolish that I prepared last night it's bubbly has a wonderful yeasty aroma and it's ready to go let me see if I can get it closed up for you to the poolish we add 140 grams of warm water then the dry ingredients which consists of 300 grams of all-purpose flour 5 grams of salt and a gram of instant yeast and we're going to mix this just until the flour is incorporated until all the ingredients come together now we have kind of a rough ball of dough but we're just going to let that sit in the bowl for ten minutes covered and then come back in ten minutes I'll show you what we do next now you're going to do a series of brief meetings that are more like stretching folds each one should only take about ten seconds the instructions call for this to be done a total of four times and 10-minute intervals about the end of which you'll have a nice smooth ball of dough and you cover it between each kneading if you wet your fingers a little bit the dough won't stick when you're kneading this is the fourth time doing this and the dough is indeed nice and smooth now now we're just going to let it sit here and proof covered for one hour all right it's been an hour we're going to punch down the dough and weigh it weighs 689 grams divided by three so we want each piece to be 230 grams so we're going to divide this into three even pieces that's 230 that's 230 so this should be 230 228 close enough all right now we need to flour the board a little bit and we're going to flatten these out gently and do an oval kind of an oval shape and stretch the ends and fold towards the middle and then you're going to take the top edge of this piece and fold it towards the the middle about 1/3 flip it 180 turn it 180 and do the same thing on the other side fold the top edge towards the middle turn it 180 do the same thing on the other edge now hopefully you have three uniform oblong loaves that you're going to let rest seam side down for 15 minutes these two look pretty good this one's not quite the same shape but now it is sort of and I'm going to cover that with a damp towel so they don't dry out while they're resting okay 15 minutes rest time and after the 15 minute rest period we're going to take one of the loaves turn it over flatten slightly and starting at one corner fold 1/3 of the way towards the middle and move to the other end do the same thing and then going back to the other side fold the other the last portion over so it's all rolled up and then just roll it out like this to form your desired to get till you get the desired length could be a little tricky getting just the right uniformity you're after that's pretty close flattened slightly starting at one corner fold one third of the way over go to the end there and one third then finish folding it over and roll it out now you're going to place them on your flowered couch or baking linen cover and let them rise until they're about double in size it's about one hour now the fun part scoring and baking a couple of ways you can do this is to transfer the loaves to a baguette pan like this score the loaves and go straight into your preheated oven or if you're using a baking stone you can transfer them onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet which slides easily onto the stone and that's what I'm going to do now I'll use this baguette flipping board to transfer the dough onto the cookie sheet for scoring use a long or a super-sharp blade scoring can be a bit tricky you want about 5 1/4 inch deep cuts down the middle overlapping by 1/3 and the blade held at about a 45-degree angle and you need to move kind of fast so you get a clean cut and don't tear the dough I think you need to do this several hundred times to get the feel for it it's awesome to watch a real pro do it most of the time I don't get it right and what I do it's pure luck and into the 475 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until golden brown I'll pour about a half a cup of water into a hot pan to produce some steam all right it's been about 17 minutes definitely look like they're done and they sound like they're done they're done now we'll let them cool for about an hour let's see if we can pick up some of that wonderful crackling noise did bread mix while it's cooling all right let's take a look at the inside all right well these look pretty good the crumb which is the inside part of the bread on a baguette it is supposed to be characterized by lots of random size holes with none of them too big this particular loaf could have more of the larger holes for that I could experiment with increasing the hydration level of the dough somewhat next time tweaking things like hydration levels proofing times and dough handling can make striving for bed perfection something of an obsession I probably made this recipe about 6 to 8 times and these loaves are pretty typical of the results I get sometimes they look a little better sometimes are not so great but everyone has delivered an excellent baguette eating experience with a crispy crackly crust and a soft creamy crumb so if you like baguettes give these a try thanks for watching you I hope you enjoyed the video one last note baguettes are best enjoyed within a few hours of baking so planned your baking schedule with that in mind have fun with it and please share your results", "2HDiagzjtYA": "I just love baking bread as it releases all your stress hello and welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor Khazana and the ultimate baking series with me chef brass today I am going to show you a very fantastic bread recipe of Bhagat so let's quickly start first I'm going to activate the east so I'm going to take a tablespoon of east or or you can say 10 grams of fresh yeast I'm going to break the East nicely and then to the east I'm going to add a pinch of sugar sugar really helps to disintegrate the East fast and then around 2 tablespoon of water and then I'm going to microwave this for round 10 seconds so after microwaving it for 10 seconds I'm going to give this a nice mix and I'm going to set this aside to activate next I'm going to grab a big bowl I'm going to sieve refined flour around 225 grams of refined flour I'm going to pass this from a sieve so that we don't find any small particle next I'm going to add some salt and then I'm going to add some more sugar into the flour give this a nice mix next I'm going to make well in the center I'm going to add the activated East as you can see the air bubbles on the top that means the East has activated now in goes the East and now let's make this nicely with the refined flour and then I'm going to start adding water and knead this into a soft dough so now as you see the flour has come together at this stage I'm going to take this out on my work table then I'm going to lightly dust my work table with some refined flour and now I'm going to start stretching this so now that you see our dough is ready you need to make a nice soft dough and now I'm going to dust some refined flour in that same bowl place this in and then I'm going to cover this with a wet muslin cloth and now I'm going to keep this in a warm place for proving for around 10 to 15 minutes now after 15 minutes as you see the dough has doubled in size now quickly I'm going to dust some refined flour and then I'm going to knock back the dough and take out all the air from it and now I'm going to roll this into thin rectangular sheet and now after rolling this into a thin rectangular sheet I'm going to start rolling this from one edge and then from the side I'm going to take the topmost layer and just tuck this in and now we need us some refined love on a parchment paper which I've lined on a baking tray and then I'm going to transfer this and now again I'm going to cover this with a wet muslin cloth and keep this for proofing for around 25 to 30 minutes now after proving it around 20 to 25 minutes you can see again it has become double in size and now I would score this and now after scoring the bed I'm going to give some milk wash on the top and now this will go in a preheated oven at 200 degree Celsius for around 15 to 20 minutes so here it is a baguette has perfectly baked a classic baguette

to making baguettes with a light and airy crumb there are two major things to keep in mind the first being to create a strong dough with as much extensibility as possible and to be very gentle with the dough throughout the entire process so that's the philosophy I applied with this recipe and you'll see how those principles apply along the way now a quick disclaimer this is a relatively advanced recipe so if you've never made sourdough before I'd recommend starting with my basic sourdough bread recipe which I'll link in the description below and for this one I'm gonna assume that you already understand the basic principles of bread making so I'm not gonna explain every step in depth but I will still talk through the reasoning behind the decisions that I made so let's get into it [Music] if you're new here my name is Charlie and on this channel I show you how to create delicious food using simple ingredients and techniques so that you can become a more confident home cook so let's make some baguettes so as usual with sourdough bread the first thing we'll need to do is mix the levan in this case I'm mixing 30 grams of mature starter with 100 grams of flour and 100 grams of room-temperature water for the flour I'm using my usual blend of 50% whole wheat flour and 50% all-purpose flour but you can really use whatever type of flour you want personally I do like to include the whole-wheat though because the rest of the recipe will consist entirely of white bread flour so including a little bit of whole wheat here will just help with the fermentation since it provides a little extra nutrition for the yeast either way you'll just want to let the levan rise until at least doubled in size which for me takes about 10 hours at room temperature but again it all depends on your environment and the types of flour that you're using so I usually let the levan rise overnight but also link my sample baking schedule in the description below so you can see the exact timing that I use so here I am about 10 hours later and my levan has doubled in size so I'm ready to start mixing my dough so get out a large bowl and add 250 grams of room-temperature water at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 21 degrees Celsius then add 200 grams of your levan which should be pretty much the entire thing considering that some of it will stick to the sides and the bottom of the jar then stir that into the water until it's fully distributed now add 375 grams of unbleached bread flour and stir with the dough whisk and or your hands until all of the flour is fully hydrated like I said we're only using white flour in the stress be in order to make the baguettes as light and airy as possible and to create a mild but very aromatic flavor anyways once the dough is fully mixed we're gonna perform a 45 minute Auto leas which I realize is in a traditional auto lease since it includes the levan but it serves the same purpose we want to perform the auto leaves at about 75 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 24 degrees Celsius so I'm just gonna set my proofing box to that temperature and throw it in there for 45 minutes now after the auto leaf sprinkle eight grams of salt over the top of the dough along with an additional 20 grams of water and fold it into the dough to get it evenly distributed then I like to transfer the dough to a clear rectangular container for the bulk fermentation but you can also just leave it in the same bowl if you prefer so this dough has a total hydration of 78 percent which you can see broken down on the screen this is a bit higher than some baguette recipes call for but the high hydration will create some extra extensibility in the dough which will help us to achieve a really nice open crumb but if you do like a denser crumb or you just want to make the dough easier to work with you can reduce the water content and the recipe and it'll still work fine also keep in mind that all flours are slightly different so feel free to use your own discretion and adjust the water content and the recipe to achieve your desired result now since this dough only contains white flour we're actually gonna perform the bulk fermentation at a relatively lower temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit which will allow the dough to ferment more slowly creating some extra flavor and this also gives the gluten in the dough more time to develop which will help the baguettes to maintain their structure while still achieving a nice open crumb so for most you you can probably just leave it at room temperature or if you have a proofing box like me just set that to 75 degrees Fahrenheit I made a tutorial on how to make your own proofing box for relatively cheap which I'll link below for those of you who haven't seen it anyways once the dough is fully mix just throw it in that 75 degree environment for another 30 minutes now for the book fermentation we're gonna perform a total of six sets of folds spaced out at 30 minute intervals so we'll be performing three sets of stretching folds followed by three sets of coil folds so again I'm gonna assume you're already familiar with the folding process and if not feel free to check out my basic sourdough bread recipe for more detailed instructions but basically for each set of stretching folds I perform eight folds along the perimeter of the dough stretching as far as it'll go without tearing and for each set of coil folds I perform or folds lifting the dough up then letting it stretch down under its own weight and folding it back over itself these folds are especially important for baguettes since they're so delicate and they need plenty of gluten development to hold in the gases necessary to achieve an open crumb so once you've finished the six set of folds just place the dough back into your 75 degree environment for another 60 minutes then after that 60 minutes it's time to divide and shape the dough so be sure to coat your surface with a good dusting of flour and turn the dough out with the top side down then divide the dough into two equal pieces and shape each piece into a taut ball using your bench scraper to develop tension I didn't do a great job of dividing evenly here as you can see but if you really want to be exact you could even weigh out the pieces either way go ahead and dust the dough with a bit of extra flour to prevent any sticking then cover it with a kitchen towel and leave it to bench rest for about 25 minutes and after that 25 minutes it's time for the final shaping so one additional piece of equipment you'll need at this point is a sheet like this which is known as a Koosh since baguettes are obviously too long for any type of proofing basket we'll use this instead so you'll place the baguettes between folds and the Koosh and the material will support the sides of the baguette to make sure it rises up rather than rising outward now of course you can also just use a kitchen towel if you have one that's large enough but the nice thing about the couch is that it's made of a very sturdy material so it does a great job of supporting the sides of the loaves so if you plan to make a lot of baguettes I definitely recommend getting one anyway just dust your couch with some flour to prevent any sticking and I like to use rice flour here just as I do with my Banton's when I use those and now we're ready for the actual shaping this is the part of a gap making that takes the most practice when you're first getting started so don't get discouraged if you mess it up the first few times you'll get better eventually it just takes some practice also just keep in mind that you'll only want to make the baguettes as big as your oven can handle so I baked my baguettes on a pizza stone which is about 16 inches long so I'll aim to make them about 14 to 15 inches long to account for a little bit of expansion so I actually like to keep a ruler on my table as I'm shaping them so I can make sure that they're the right size so to shape them start by turning one of your loaves over so the unplowed side is facing up and be sure to dust the flowered side with plenty of flour so it doesn't stick to your surface then gently stretch the top portion and fold it over about three quarters of the way down the loaf then turn the dough around and repeat that same process with the other side remember to be very gentle throughout the entire shaping process to preserve all of the airiness that's developed but you do want to pop any particularly large bubbles that form on the outer surface now little by little grab the dough from the top and stretch it all the way down to develop lots of tension then pinch it down with your fingers to seal it off once you've made it across the entire length of the dough rotate it set the seam side is facing down and gently work the dough back and forth with your hands like so to develop some additional tension as you start to stretch the dough lengthwise after you do that a few times go ahead and start rolling out the dough starting from the middle and gradually tapering out toward the edges try to do this in one smooth motion if possible to avoid handling the dough more than necessary and deflating it then just free up the bag out with your bench scraper making sure no parts of it are still stuck to the surface and gently transfer it to your Koosh creating folds on either side to provide some support then just repeat that process with the second baguette and place it directly next to the first I also like to play some heavy objects on the outside it's like a large book to create some extra support now just cover them up and let them proof for about one to two hours or until they spring back slowly when poked during proofing the dough inflates where the gas is produced by fermentation but meanwhile the gluten network is gradually weakening so the goal is to bake the loaves when they're fully inflated but before they've lost a significant amount of their structure so you can see that at the beginning of proofing when the dough is at its strongest it springs back right away but as the gluten structure gradually breaks down the dough springs back slower and slower until you get to this point which is the perfect level of proofing if it doesn't spring back at all that means it's over proved so just make a note to use a shorter proof next time but of course you can still bake the loaf in that case it just may not rise to its maximum potential so the proofing time will be highly dependent on your environment but for reference my room temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius and I proofed the loaves for an hour and 15 minutes this time and about 30 minutes into the proof you'll want to start preheating your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 260 degrees Celsius to get it as hot as possible before baking now like I mentioned I bake my baguettes on a pizza stone and I highly recommend that you do the same because the stones ability to retain heat is gonna help the baguettes to cook all the way through and get nice and crispy on the outside but even more important and that is to create steam in your oven during the first few minutes of baking obviously these baguettes won't fit in a Dutch oven so we'll need to use a different method which involves using a cast-iron pan filled with lava rocks or pebbles along with the disposable pie pan and some ice basically before you pre-heat your oven you'll want to place the baking stone on the top rack then on the bottom rack place your cast-iron pan filled with lava rocks then take your disposable pie pan and poke a few holes in the bottom and right before you bake the bread place two cups of ice into the pie pan and set it on top of the lava rocks so this way the ice will slowly melt causing water to drip down into the hot pan and since the lava rocks are slightly porous they'll help to slow the release of steam even further so once your baguettes are fully proofed and ready to bake get out a flat baking tray or pizza peel and line it with a piece of parchment paper then very gently transfer your baguettes onto that sheet i'd highly recommend using some sort of transfer board for this which could be as simple as a cutting board or sturdy piece of cardboard like I'm using here so just gently flip the baguettes one at a time onto the board then flip them back over onto the baking sheet now you'll need to work quickly here to prevent the dough from flattening out so fill your pie pan with the ice and throw it into the oven then score your loaves for baguettes of the size I'd recommend making two slashes along the length of the loaf not straight across but just at a slight angle also make sure not to score too close to the edges and don't score too deep either you only want to go about a quarter inch down finally to achieve a nice ear on your loaves you'll want to score at an angle to the surface of the loaves about 30 to 45 degrees from parallel and it's especially important for our baguettes to use a very sharp razor when scoring it seems like a lot to think about but it'll become second nature once you do it enough times anyways as soon as those are scored head over to your oven and slide the loaves off onto your pizza stone and the parchment paper should make this really simple if you worked fast enough there shouldn't be much steam generated yet so quickly close your oven and reduce the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit which is about 230 degrees Celsius and after another 30 seconds to a minute you should see a significant amount of steam start to pour out of the oven then after the loaves have been in the oven for 15 minutes remove the cast iron pan to prevent any more steam from being generated which will allow the crust to become browned and crispy now the remaining cooking time will depend on your preferences so just keep your loves in the oven until they're brown to your liking about another 8 to 15 minutes I also like to rotate them after about 7 minutes to make sure that all sides cook evenly this time I left him in for ten minutes which was just about perfect for my preferences then once they're done remove them to a wire rack and let them cool for at least an hour before cutting into them to make sure the inside is completely cooked and that's all there is to it I know it's not the most simple recipe but if you made basic loaves of sourdough bread before the process really is pretty similar with just a few minor adjustments so now that you know how to make baguettes if you want to learn how to make some other delicious baked goods be sure to click the playlist on the bottom right corner of the screen so there you go I'll see you all in the next one", "L76I01n9csk": "hello again my name's John I'm a retired chef from the northeast of England in the UK and welcome to another bread video and in this one I'll be making these fantastic sourdough mini baguettes you can view the ingredients list and full written method for this recipe on the recipe page on my website I leave links at the end and under the video or just click on the I icon top right of the screen before I go any further I'd like to give a quick shout out to this week's patreon and PayPal donators and they are Simon Walker Tom storey odd Linda Thompson Lynn us a bonus Catherine G white thank you very much everyone it really does help the channel and as I mentioned this is a sourdough bread recipe so you'll need a sourdough starter to follow along if you don't have a starter please see my sword or start a video on how to make one I'll leave links in the description box below the video or just hit the I icon top right of the screen okay I'll begin the recipe by making what's called to polish and this needs to be made well in advance of making the baguettes and let it sit at room temperature for several hours I normally set mine away the day before right in the ball a half 200 grams that 7 ounces of water called a room temperature is fine try to use bottled or filtered water if he can't next add 50 grams that's 2 ounces of your starter that's been sitting in the fridge make sure you get these measurements correct because this polish is part of the whole recipe followed by 200 grams that's 7 ounces of strong white bread flour [Music] now give that a good mix cover the ball and let it sit at room temperature for at least eight hours all this does is allow the starter to become strong and healthy and ready to begin making the bread in this case baguettes and for those who are not familiar with salad or it's a homemade east but with in my view a much better taste than commercial yeast and once you've made your sourdough yeast you can keep it indefinitely in your fridge but like I said check out my sword or start a video for everything you need to know about the subject and here's why I made yesterday now this police has been sitting on my kitchen bench for the last 10 hours and as you can see it's all bubbly active and ready to go okay time to weigh off the rest of the ingredients for this recipe starting with 520 grams that's eighteen point three ounces of bread flour followed by three hundred and twenty grams that's eleven point three ounces of water and yes it's always much more accurate to weigh the water to finally eight grams that's one teaspoon of salt and that's all you need for this baguette recipe right time to put the dill together I'll start by pouring the water into a suitable ball next I'll add the police to the water and give it a good whisk make sure you scrape it all out of the ball with a spatula don't forget the ingredients list and full written method for this dish is now on the recipe page on my website just click on the I icon top right of the screen or simply click on the link in the description box below the video next add the flower followed by the salt and mix that to a sticky door I'll be using my trusty wooden spoon handle the mixed mind you can use the stand to mix it to do this part if you wish but only until the door comes together remember this is a no need recipe but as this only takes about 90 seconds to mix I'm just going to do mine by hand try to scrape it all of the sides of the ball to right cover your ball and set your timer for the first of three 45 minute rises these 45 minute rest and rise periods are very important to achieve the fantastic taste structure and texture of these buckets okay after the first 45 minutes slightly wet the bench and scrape out the door and with wet hands give it a few turns but only for about 30 seconds are shown in the video this turning action distributes the temperature and knocks the door buck or de Gus's it and this is when you should see and feel the door becoming much smoother now get it back into the ball cover it and set your timer for the second 45 minute period after the second rise do exactly the same take it out give it a few turns with wet hounds and bench get it buck into the ball and set the timer for the third and last 45 minutes [Music] okay while waiting for the door to rise I'll get a couple of things ready start him with the baker's couche all this is is a well floured piece of material to proof the buckets on I use 100% cotton pillowcase for mine it's a lot cheaper than the proper baker's couche material and it does exactly the same job you'll also need a slightly oiled strip of cling film or plastic wrapper this is to cover the pre shaped buckets a little later set that aside for now next job I need to lightly oil a couple of baking trays I simply under drop a vegetable oil and wipe most of it off with a paper towel there should be enough on the paper to do the other tree to the trees I'm using our 30 by 30 centimeters that's 12 by 12 inches right the next job is to flower the worktop and get you digital scales ready to divide the door into however many buckets you're making out of this recipe you can get either 4 large 6 medium or as I'm gonna do 8 small okay once the time's up turn up the door onto the floured surface sprinkle flour over the door and divide it into 4 equal pieces and if you're making six buckets divide yours into six equal pieces and if your measurements were correct at the beginning each of your four pieces should weigh approximately 310 grams that's 11 ounces each now the next step is to pre-shape the buckets and let the door relax a while this'll make forming the final bucket shape much easier rather than me trying to explain how to do this step it's easier if you just watch and copy the way I'm doing the pre shapes [Music] once all the pre shapes have made cover them with the oil cling film that was prepared earlier and have a bit of a cleanup and let them rest for 15 minutes [Music] once the times up flour the bench again and start to form the buckets as shown [Music] you can either make four large buckets from here or as I'm gonna do eight small ones first our eyeball each piece in half once again rather than me trying to explain how to do them probably the best way is to watch how I form the buckets I'll go through the first couple slowly so you can get an idea how it's done and fly through the rest but really the best way to learn is to practice yourself even if they're not perfect bucket shapes they'll still have the fantastic taste I do explain in a bit more detail in my other bucket videos on how to form them if you want to have a look at those but I'll say it again practice is the key [Music] once you form each baguette place it on the couch as shown [Music] once all the buckets are on the couch cover them with the dry lightweight cloth and set your timer for 30 minutes when there's only 10 minutes left on the proofing time pre-heat your oven to 230 degrees Celsius that's 446 Fahrenheit or gas mark 8 you'll also need to place upon a hot water on the bottom shelf of the oven this will create a steamy atmosphere in the oven which makes the baguettes crispy one more thing you'll need is a spray bottle of water standing by for a little later okay the times up so I'll carefully transfer the buckets to the lightly oiled baking trays evenly spaced them out once arranged on the tree score the buckets with a very sharp knife or razor blade on this occasion am using this blade called a baker's LeMay these are brilliant for scoring bread dough and you can find them quite easily online I'll be making three slashes on each of these buckets check out my French baguette video on how to properly score the dough right I'll quickly go through the rest of the baguettes and get them into the preheated oven now carefully open the oven door to prevent a blast of steam once they're safely in the oven give the inside a quick spray with water this will make the baguettes even crispier get the door shut set your timer for 18 minutes this time may vary depending on how well done you prefer your buckets after 10 minutes I'll be swapping mine top to bottom and back to front this is for even cooking okay time's up so I'll get them out and onto a wire rack to cool for a few minutes and once again release the steam slowly when you're opening the oven door and don't they look fantastic [Music] they feel really late and just listen to how crisp they are and I hope you noticed how much they'd written in the oven this is called oven spring right it's been about 15 minutes or cut one open so you can see the inside and just listen to that once again how crisp lease our door buckets are and it has quite a nice bubbly Chrome on the inside the texture and structure look fantastic under smelling my kitchens amazing I can't do a taste test today but I assure you these sourdough baguettes have a truly fantastic flavor and those who know sourdough bread will know exactly what I mean so get yourself a sourdough starter made and have a go these and other sourdough recipes I promise you won't

Sasha on the other copy editor I'm Shelby I'm the journalist editorials editor and today we're gonna be trying against ten different ways and today we're going to be eating baguettes prepared ten different ways garlic bread it's really good I've only had garlic bread on a baguette so I don't know but I think like I've had it on legs buns that's really good especially because it's warm just kind of ovens I like the crunch I did like a bunch of the toastiness of it yeah it's nice so there's a little crisp to it I think I put some cheese on it like spice stuff oh no good call I think it'd be good even too if you like sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on top I thought would be good I don't he's always good yeah I'm gonna give this a 3 out of 5 I'm gonna go three out of five guys I'm gonna give this four baguettes out of five baguettes I thought it was pretty solid and a great way to eat grilled bread [Music] so this is blue shadow on a baguette I'm a little nervous because I don't love to me I also hate Tomatoes I like them like in a salsa in a sauce the rock manners would make me like that so that's something fun I'll be honest my pop we're shows a kind of cheese but um it's actually really good you know um gotta say the balsamic covers up the tomato taste pretty well um like that yeah because you had surprising yeah I actually really like this I love bruschetta go to appetizer Oh so I restaurant sometimes so five baguettes out of five baguettes I'm now second that I I'm gonna go with two bigots in five beers because I guess don't vibe with tomatoes I'm gonna give that a four to five because I don't buy with tomatoes but I kind of vibe with that nice I know this is a veggie BLT otherwise known as an ulti okay LT they're very cute they're very small in which they eat them let's go Cheers I think this is very refreshing mm-hmm the Stefan wants to bite into but you get a lot of flavor not bad it's not something that like the baguette has really made yeah there's some guy likes party snack yeah it's small yeah quick bite yeah I like this one four out of five that gets I will also give it four out of five answer that's small and cute so like aesthetically this would probably be like or begnettes out of five bigots but execution-wise I'm gonna give it a one yeah um I'm gonna give it two out of five bigots I mean I'm not a big fan of Tomatoes already so yeah it'd be a good like appetizer yeah or if you toasted it maybe yeah we're gonna sort of taste like a salad yeah [Music] we are trying arugula cheese and apple sandwiches can be even eaten open or closed face it's very good it's like classy makes me feel fancy yeah I love arugula so this is a definitely a winner for me the Apple that's a really nice yeah I agree um it's kind of has spring tiny vibes with like the greens and the fruit apple pie and cheese of the classic so make sense at apples and cheese would work on a baguette um I think that I would rate it four out of five Beckett's I think I'm also gonna read it four out of five that guns utter at this one four out of five because it's interesting it's unique yeah I'm doing the same it's gonna be four out of five four V's yeah and I'm always worried my Rubio's gonna like go bad so this is another way to use it which is perfect true okay so we're gonna be trying B baguette as a crouton we got some lettuce to replicate a salad it's like lettuce wraps yeah yeah all right the lettuce is refreshing mm-hmm I like how crunchy it is too because sometimes my mom makes homemade croutons and her soft took forever to eat was really dry really dry um in terms of like I've heard of regular crouton I don't know about this does any better a little more flavor I guess I think they're definitely better than anything can find at the store and a bag so I agree I really like it I like this too actually yeah I'll keep it a fortified I agree four out of five baguettes yeah I'm giving this one bag out of the pocket so I'm gonna give it to two out of five because it's good for crouton written on stone much to work with already [Music] this is Nutella on a baguette not the most creative thing at her but I'm excited because I haven't had Nutella in so long yeah I'm very excited for this one Cheers good I think the bigot adds a little something from like a store-bought like whole wheat loaf of bread or something okay nice softness like a bouncy texture I think it's definitely a step up from because the bread is like rich exactly and amazing when you rated I rated it five out of five because I love Nutella so you do it I give it five bigots out of five five bigots out of five bigots yeah I will say if I don't win the dry and I'm name I'm thoroughly enjoying this so I'm definitely gonna give this five five out of five I guess I'm gonna give it 4.5 out of 5 I guess delicious [Music] now we're gonna try some yeah I've never had melba toast before me neither kind of looks like a bright toast but you know that could be good I never actually had this so no one knows what from Elberton is apparently so good flavor mm-hmm more flavor than the average melba toast that you would expect I like to try some herbs on top that's really good kind of bland mm-hmm I think I would probably like dip it in like hummus or something I feel like it can be good in oil yeah some olive oil drizzle doctor yeah I think that'd be a gonna do yeah that would be good not my favorite I'm gonna give it three bigots out of five minutes get this one also three out of five yeah well okay but yeah I'm gonna say 5 out of 5 this is a pleasant surprise 4 out of 5 [Music] with olive oil and vinegar mm-hmm swirl around just having a good time mix it up mm-hmm very good I actually do this all the time because it makes me feel fancy when I just cooked something really simple like pass or a salad at my house solid good combination a good appetizer hmm I got a restaurant I'm gonna go with three baguettes out of five because I understand that it's not the most elaborate thing but it is really good I'm gonna give it two big outs out of five so I'm gonna give this 5 by gets out of 5 back yeah I'm gonna give it 4 out of 5 just these are French toasts but made from baguette all right let's go to back it's really good I'm surprised and it's like kind of thick I like the thickness I like - I thought it was gonna be bad is usually having on sliced bread yeah this is good that is really good and really fun it felt like I was eating a tiny piece of toast that is really good it was really sponging yeah Wow I recommend that everyone should just make all french toast with baguettes from now on because I'm giving it five five and five I give it a four and five fingers I'll go four point five out of five I guess I rate this baguette also 4.5 out of 5 oh yeah 5 interesting I think if we put like berries or something on it 5 out of 5 [Music] so this is the grilled cheese bag out whoo it's good Oh God yeah I think that maybe could have more butter but it's my saying it's missing cheese that's in it mm-hmm that's really good I don't know what about the baguette maybe that it's white bread maybe that it makes a cute sandwich maybe that it's really thick and chewy but it was really good it's it's a big bite - yeah I mean it's not very comfortable to chew I almost wished it was like softer Brad yeah anything you could just very easily bite into really good yeah I didn't I thought I'd be like Europe but I think that's a better it's something like really soft you're a lot of a lot of I think bread for the butter to sink into I'm gonna give this one a - 25 minutes I guess I'm gonna give it a 1 having 5 buckets so I'm gonna give this five big instead of five minutes I'm also gonna give us one five big outs out of five big s it's really good yeah I think my favorite definitely was the bruschetta and had good flavor pretty consistent everywhere you go so it had like that it was really satisfying yeah no one was good - icing maybe since I'm a mom [Music] agreed so definitively the best ways to eat a baguette my top choice is going to have to be the French toast it was really good it was really cute it was unexpected kind of snuck up on me I thought it wasn't gonna be good and then it blew my mind yeah I mean my top choice is gonna be the grilled cheese but I would mix it with the bruschetta that was also up there so if you look like in the grilled cheese I mean that'd be like six out of five pickups innovation innovation yeah that's what we're here for and we hope you get to try some of these baguettes at home thanks for watching I hope you try one of these [Music] [Music] [Music]", "pRJ7b0sVXUc": "[Music] we are at yet another most exciting step of the pocket making process the scoring of the baguette the scoring is best achieved with a an old-fashioned tool called a lamb it's in essence a simple thin piece of spring steel and we are putting in an old-fashioned razor blade that will give us this absolutely exacting cut notice how the razor blade is in a curve at this point because we put it over the steel the razor blade is in a curve this will achieve a very important point and that is that when cutting a baguette we are not cutting straight down as one would assume we actually holding the blade almost parallel perhaps 10 degrees of parallel from the surface of the dough so the cut would be rather like this and not like that the second important part that is also not visible to the eye and that is only known in an artisan circles is that the the long cut goes almost parallel to the size of the packet so again not diagonal as one would assume when one sees a finished baguette often but the cut is almost in the center third of the baguette the center third in here almost parallel to the edge of the pocket we're starting in the center flat position of the blade and we're going cutting down one third almost parallel to the side we're moving up one third of the first cut slightly to the right and we're going down for another cut up one third of the second cut and then again over about a centimeter and then down to the very tip of the packet this will allow us then to will the packet will when the when they go in the oven the baguette will unfurl beautifully almost like a flower and fast forward as this is really an important cut and it has to be done in precision I'm going to be quiet as it would be in a real situation so last check the oven is preheated thoroughly at 250 degrees the baking plate and the steam power inside preheated with the oven we have our water at the ready we are going to move very quickly but carefully of course and quickly we close the oven door what will happen in next five minutes is let the baguette will through the transfer of the heat of the baking plate and that immediate steam will get this beautiful rice and it happens within the first five minutes that's very critical we set the timer for 10 minutes at 250 degrees and after 10 minutes or when we notice that the the edge the rich of that beautifully unfurled baguette becomes dark brown like a almost like a coffee roast color then we turn it back to or we turn it down to 200 degrees for an additional 10 minutes that is to ensure that the baguette will be truly crispy and fully baked so we get this delicate crunchy forget that we are looking for [Music] so 10 minutes have passed and our baguettes showed beautiful dark brown color along the ridges going to reset it for another 10 minutes and we are turning the temperature down to 200 so that our baguettes can get this beautiful thorough crust and the crumb can fully baked as well now 20 minutes are about over and just to make sure time and temperature are always a guideline when baking bread and each oven is slightly different each batch perhaps is a bit different so one has guidelines but one still must understand and know when is the bread baked properly this of course you need Baker's hands to pull that out please wear gloves the baguette is still a bit prolonged I think we could leave it in for another perhaps two minutes to let it finish one can feel by the crunch by the hollowness of the tap and of course at the end of the day by the color let's leave them in for another two minutes the moment of truth our additional two minutes are over and we're going to remove all baguettes with our transfer board and we are reheating oven to tune and 50 degrees for the next batch now it's a beautiful golden baguettes the crust at this point is quite firm almost hard and what happens during the cooling process the baguette will release more of the moisture the crust will become a bit more gentle and at the final cooling stage the crust will pick up once more a little bit for this beautiful delicate crust the cuts in the baguette are not only beautiful they also provide us rigidity but they also create sort of almost as little like little chimneys for the moisture to come out on these on these cuts this will ensure fairly ensure that our baguettes are beautiful and crispy the additional cuts also create an additional surface area which as well is part of the attempt in making these beautiful delicate crispy baguettes I think this is a really successful patch so this our second set our second set of faux baguettes they have been cooled down and slowed down for that final fermentation in the refrigerator while the first four baguettes we're baking nicely in the oven this is a very practical thing to do if you want to produce a bit more bread for further for your home and also to utilize the heat of the oven very efficiently we're going to repeat our loading of the baguette onto the transfer board that's it Chagas check oven is preheated at 250 we have water in here and again we calmly but swiftly we are putting our baguettes inside so we don't lose too much heat wonderful steam always lifts my heart gets so exciting and again 10 minutes at 250 degrees to get our but gets going now our first 10 minutes at 250 degrees are over now and I'm going to go for a slightly darker and bolder bake so I'm adding two minutes on at 250 degrees this will give me a slightly darker Ridge and what I believe just a more beautiful and rustic baguette so we have another 15 seconds left at 250 degrees so we had 10 minutes originally we added another two minutes at 250 for slightly bold opaque and I'm going to give it now the remaining 8 minutes for a total of 20 minutes of baking time at which point then I will assess whether the pocket is done enough so eight minutes 200 degrees for a total of 20 minutes of baking time again and then we'll assess the doneness of our baguette so a few more seconds for the completion of the total of 20 minutes we were trying I'm was trying to get a slightly bolder bacon to these pockets by increasing the amount of time the baguettes spent at 250 degrees beautiful two versions the same batch of baguettes one got ten minutes at 250 and an additional 12 minutes at 200 and these had 12 minutes at 250 and 8 minutes at 200 degrees so they really baked 2 minutes less than these and obviously I have a theory that a bold bake will give me a moister juicy a baguette and of course visually definitely more appealing to me and of course a crust that really is worth its money and I can hear them sing I think they're happy one one important thing of course is the rack to ensure that the air can reach the baguette all around and allow for a proper cooling one doesn't want to forget to be resting on a table on any hard surface always on some sort of a screen or elevated to ensure that baguettes can breathe really well you", "BdzV5KHCnlg": "How to Make a French Baguette. Your loved\nones will say, \"Ooh, la, la!\" when you pull this French baguette out of the oven. You\nwill need 4 c. unbleached all-purpose flour \u00bd tsp. salt 1 tbsp. active dry yeast 2 c.\nwarm water A couple of tablespoons of oil Cornmeal A bowl of water A baking sheet Parchment\npaper and a baking stone (optional). Step 1. Mix the flour and salt in a medium-size\nbowl. Step 2. Put the yeast, water, and half the flour mixture in a large bowl and mix\nit together with your hands until it's doughy. Cover with a clean dishcloth and let it sit\nat room temperature for three hours, until it more than doubles in size. Step 3. Using\nyour hands, mix the remaining flour mixture into the dough. Step 4. Transfer the dough\nto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes. Step 5. Place the dough\nin a large, lightly-oiled bowl, turning the dough around in the bowl so it gets covered\nwith oil. Cover with a dishcloth and let it sit for another hour. It should nearly double\nin size. Step 6. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and knead the dough one more time\nfor about five minutes before dividing it into three parts. Roll each part into a long\nbaguette with your hands, and let them rise in a warm, draft-free spot, for another half\nhour. If you have a baking stone, put that in the oven to preheat. Step 7. Make four\nlengthwise slashes on top of the loaf with a sharp knife, going no deeper than \u00bc inch.\nLightly spritz or brush the top with cool water. If you're not using the baking stone,\ncover an upside-down baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle it with cornmeal. Step\n8. Place a medium-size bowl filled halfway with water on the bottom rack of the oven.\nBake the baguettes in the middle of the oven on the baking stone or sheet. Remove the bowl\nafter 15 minutes. Continue baking the bread until golden, 20 to 30 minutes total. Step\n9. Take the bread off the stone or pan and turn it upside down on the upper oven rack.\nBake five minutes longer. Eat some while it's still warm.

already know man what's happening I'm so happy right now to be a part of the challenge of bread we're family and so I'm gonna put together a little series for y'all with some of the bakes that I'm about to be doing it now I'm super excited to start using the Challenger bread pan I've been seeing it you know so many successful bakes it is a beautiful marvelous piece of equipment for any home baker and like I said big shout out to Lisa and Jim challenger and the whole challenge of bread we're team so let's get started for today's episode we're gonna do sourdough Becket's I really like the fact that this pan is shaped to where you can actually get a decent size a little Demi baguette in there so we use you know are you already know sourdough baguette recipe where that is I just did something on the ID TV thing on the Instagram so you can check that out that whole process so I'm not gonna get into the dough making process I will show you the shape that I like to do the size of the baguettes how to shape improve them and ultimately how to bake them in that challenge of bread pan so get it going you know saying alright guys so check it out real quick the gear for sure the bench knife is for me it's like the the biggest surprise of how nice it is it's bit it's big it's nice and it's you know it's a great size great handle it's got a great grip so I'm super super happy with receiving that in addition to the bench knife got this super fire challenger broiler apron it's got that cross back in action on it you know and it feels amazing it's you know it's very movable breathable you know what I'm saying so make sure that you know you go in the description of the video I got the links there for you to cop that challenger bro we're here make sure your support and make sure that you're geared up to make the best homemade bread ever obviously the Challenger bread pan itself the the legend is it's already legendary man so I'm super happy about it we're gonna shake 300 gram baguettes proof um and bake them into bread pan so the size that I'm gonna do is three on the grams I think that's gonna be kind of the perfect size to get a couple baguettes in there all right guys so for the baguette shape I'm not gonna even appreciate you know but do what you got to do [Music] and here get me a nice seam and I'm gonna roll it right before I point the ends you can see it's roughly the size of the bench knife so then I'll get the ends a nice point you can see my final baguette nice and fat in the middle a little a little bit longer than that bench knife that's going to be the size that you're gonna want to use for your challenge of bread we're pan so for the proof I've got who share on the sheet pan and I'm gonna just coat it with rice flour a [Music] [Music] yo-yo after your baguettes are shaped we're gonna let them proof for a few hours and I'm gonna throw that Challenger bread pan into the oven with about an hour to go on my proof IFM time to bake the bread pan up in is at 500 degrees and I'm going to put in that Challenger pan to preheat the dough is probably about an hour out I mean it looks pretty good so let's do it [Music] alright guys pens and out of the oven put the lid back in there I'm going to dust it lightly with semolina and my tip is to use the dough scraper to turn the baguette out and flip it into the pan [Music] all right there's baguette number one to [Music] and get the lid back on and we're gonna bake them for 15 minutes with the lid on i Pam the first timer has gone off and it is time to unveil our bake we're gonna remove the lid of the Challenger bread pan and she was good [Music] the lid has been removed of the Challenger bread pan as you can see I've got my nice fat bags right here looking lovely and now all that's left for them is to get some color [Music] hi guys so I really hope that this was helpful for you to see quick little tips of using Challenger Broadway bread pan I'm super excited to like I said to be part of the family let me know your comments questions make sure that you go into the description check out all the gear and make sure you support Lisa and Jim challenger who have been so phenomenal watching them grow this business and create this product for Baker's like you and me want to be a home and make super fire bread so let me know this was helpful for you and see y'all next time", "LrxWEebER0k": "[Music] [Laughter] yep I actually made the baguette as well as ten other silly ideas that you guys sent me on discord into a single data pack starting off with the first one which comes from dr. radar simply saying bug ants now obviously simple bread isn't enough for the game so baguettes are an absolute necessity just put in three bread as you see like so and you get a baguette in return now but gets are better than normal bread in the sense that you can eat them three times essentially because when you eat it like so you get a slightly eaten baguette and then you can eat the slightly in but yet to get a half-eaten baguette and then finally you can even eat happy again so you essentially get three bread inside of one slot this completely works if you have stacks just craft up as much as possible and when you eat it we'll just put the slightly eaten bread in a different slot so essentially holding one stack of baguettes is the same as holding three stacks of bread now like I said this is all in a data pack and I will release this data pack if this video gets 200 likes so make sure you slap that like button if you want to try out baguettes as well as everything else I've included in this video the next suggestion comes from the dark goatee who suggested minecraft but with cheese how did I not think of this myself this is an absolute necessity in the game we must have cheese so now just come over and milk a cow and then all you have to do is smelt the milk bucket what this does melting you will get a fresh cheese now fresh cheese isn't ready to be eaten yet you need to let it age a bit to let it age just simply throw it on the ground and wait again and voila you've got yourself some aged cheese now obviously you can't eat an entire block of cheese so you have to craft it up into some cheese slices which can do by just putting it in a crafting bench now you have eight delicious cheese slices which you can eat and they give you as much saturation as a pumpkin pie way so this is a really good food source and you can craft it in both now going along with us pretty well we have some else suggesting sandwiches with cheese now that we are able to craft cheese this is pretty simple just throw a piece of bread on the ground and some cheese on top of that and we get a delicious cheese sandwich not only does this look absolutely amazing and advertising if you give yourself some hunger you'll notice that when you eat it you actually get 10 seconds of saturation meaning if you were to craft up a bunch of these you can actually replenish your nourishment quite fast all these worth it to Kraft though probably not since you have to go through a huge process to make cheese just to throw one slice onto a piece of bread but in the end if you have a lot of time on your hands go ahead and make a bunch of cheese sandwiches next we have dr. pickles suggesting make exploding cake that is what I've done except I haven't made it explode all the time in fact there's only a one in five chance of it exploding meaning I can probably safely eat this but I never know if it's going to explode oh it was the last slice amazing so you can never guarantee if it's gonna explode or not so maybe just stand back a bit when you're eating this so now cake is useless not only for being super hard to craft but also because it might kill you so probably not the best food source even though I safely just ate a few of never mind the only possible use I can see her exploding cakes maybe just to play game with your friends see who gets exploded and you know just take turns eating the cake now I come to probably my favorite suggestion of the whole bunch which comes from a yoke is coke who suggested commonly used idioms made literal such as literally raining cats and dogs this is absolutely amazing it's so much fun making this and you'll see why in a second if I do slash weather rain we will see that you know starts to rain which is all fine but what isn't fine is what is about to follow which is literally cats and dogs raining out of the sky and falling on the ground I mean just like this there are literally cats and dogs falling from the sky all around me they don't take damage when they fall I can't actually punch them they won't punch me you can't use these to make like some insane farms or anything but the fact that they are literally raining cats and dogs and the best part is if I do slash weather clear the wit rain will obviously clear up but these guys will actually just float up into the sky from where they came just reverse rain essentially I mean if that isn't satisfying to walk I don't know what is I mean just go prank your friends with this do whatever you want with this this is absolutely amazing going right along with the topic of animals doctor sarnax has suggested flying pigs now this is also a pretty funny idea and now when you spawn in a pig or if they spawn naturally they have a 50% chance of becoming a flying pig so there you go you can see this pig is now a flying pig please spawn in some more you'll see that some of them turn into flying pigs some of them don't there's a 50% chance now there's a lot more to these pigs first of all they're flying they will always hover about two blocks above the ground and if I punch them they will just go off into the sky and fly away so if I just punch them any nearby pigs before just go flying off into the sky now theoretically yes you can ride these except that they are really really slow and yeah you're probably just better off walking even sneaking would probably be better than this we can see this isn't the other pigs just there on the ground wishing they could fly as well now obviously it's gonna be pretty hard to form these guys since as soon as you punch them they go off into the sky but they just look really cool in the overall and also if you go underneath them they have this nice cloud effect underneath them which just you know adds to the whole overall effect now the next suggestion comes from dr. snow suggesting a data pack that does nothing now this was more complicated than it seems I spent hours and hours and hours deleting text deleting files deleting all the folders I needed to make a data pack and in the end I think I've come up with a pretty good result now if we type in the following command nothing will commence you'll see it starts beginning the installation it might take a while it takes a while for it to accomplish this it starts downloading the libraries as we can see oh it's connected to the server database now that's good processing inherited permission and hopefully yes nothing has been completed now this was very tough I thought it would be almost impossible to complete nothing but there you can see in chat nothing has been completed now back to some actual suggestions we have tree suggesting a bow that fires backwards now this is actually so useful you have no idea how useful this is gonna be if we just spawn in some cows here quickly these will be our targets and if I go into third-person you can actually see that the arrow flies behind me there it is flying behind me and this is just so insanely useful here if I try and do some target practice on these guys you can see oh yeah that was way off Wow I cannot hit these see so it's so useful because now I can go into third person and miss all the time it's just I mean I can't get over how amazing this is it's so much better than regular bows all jokes aside though maybe this could be useful if you're like running away from someone you can just shoot and the arrow will go behind you so you can just keep running away and shooting behind you but like you can just turn around so it's not even a really good use before we move on to the next super hilarious suggestions keep in mind that if you want to be featured in a video like this just comment down below your craziest silliest dumbest Minecraft suggestions and I will choose 10 of you to be featured in another video like this but moving on to allow that sorry I don't know how to pronounce that who suggest a TNT that heals now like with the cake it doesn't always feel you have a 90% chance of being healed you can see that my hearts are pretty low and if I explode this we actually get healed and we get some nice poppies and Kapil's to heal us even more but like I said there's only a 90% chance so you always have a chance of getting exploded like so this guy is definitely gonna explode oh wow and it took a lot of damage I better heal up with some more healing TNT so let's see oh no I got another 10% chance what are the chances oh yeah I'm gonna die let's see oh there we go I got healing it so it's never guaranteed but you could definitely bring this with you and there's like another 10% how am I so unlucky but like I was saying you could easily bring this with you into a battle and heal up pretty quickly just like so and you know take the chances that you might die next we have Samuel 2020 again suggesting make it so that you need a crafting table to craft a crafting table now this is absolutely genius but also terrible because how are you gonna get a crafting table in the beginning if you don't have a crafting table so let me demonstrate here we have a tree I'd responded to a world and we get our first logs I go craft some planks and I go to craft a crafting table but it doesn't actually work the only way now you can actually craft a crafting table is using a crafting table you have to do a 3x3 grid of planks to get a crafting table so there's absolutely no way to get a crafting table without a grounding tables on how pointless is that so I guess you have to just find a village with a crafting table and stock up on these because you're not gonna be able to craft these so which one was your favorite was it the baguette maybe the cheese maybe the raining cats and dogs I still can't get over I mean just just look at that anyway comment down below which one it was and also comment down below your silly data pack suggestions and you have a chance to be featured in a future video but that make sure you subscribe and I'll see you next time [Music]", "O2k7bbz7imQ": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a French baguette and this is what it looks like as you can see it has that really nice the classic long thin shape and nice crispy crust and then inside it's wonderfully soft and chewy and as you can see we've got the nice ears here that's what they're called these little rough edges which a baguette has so to make a baguette there's a couple different ways you can do it with machine but what today we're gonna make it just by hand is called a hand mix baguette really easy no kneading so I mean if you're new to making a baguette this is a good recipe to start with so in a large bowl I like one that's pretty wide I have okay first you need a scale I'm recommending the scale like I always do but really when you're measuring flour you're way more accurate if you use a scale you I'm gonna give you cups but really it's time to buy a scale so you will need 475 grams of bread flour that's 3 and 2/3 cups and I'm also using 65 grams 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour you mean oh that is plain flour and you know the bread flour is what gives us a nice soft and chewy texture and then along with that we are going to use 2 grams which is 3/4 of a teaspoon of SAF Gold instant yeast this a little different than the act of dry this is used by professionals and we don't have to proof it which is really good and it's it this is type yeast is really good when you have a long fermentation period which we do with a baguette so you know you can find it online Amazon is where I got mine so just keep that in mind and then what we're another ingredient you may not be familiar with is we're going to add 3 grams which is 1 teaspoon of dry malt dye esthetic powder and what that does is yeast need sugar to feed on and then it releases gases and gives us that wonderful flavor so the this kind of malt power powder breaks down the starch into sugar which is and this is really good again when you have a long fermentation period and it also helps with browning our baguette give that wonderful golden-brown color again you can get it online so let's put that in there and then we need some salt for flavor plus it does ten salt tends to slow down the fermentation process which is really good again with this particular recipe so we're using 10 grams two and a half teaspoons I like to use a kosher salt so just dump that in and then we're gonna give that I'm just using my hand you'd use a whisk mix all that in and then we need water now like I said this dough is actually we're gonna do the first fermentation is three hours because we are not kneading the dough so it needs that long fermentation period and we don't want the dough to be too warm we want it room temperature and by room temperature I mean that's between 74 and 77 Fahrenheit which is 23 25 Celsius so we don't our water temperature is very important so I have a formula it's in the head note but I'll just give you an example my room temperature is 77 degrees Fahrenheit 25 C and that means my flowers at that temperature so I need a cool temperature of my water actually I'm doing it at about 68 degrees 19 C so to get that you will need an insta read the mom didn't put in there or Rick just happened to have in his tool box this infrared really fancy dance I just beam it on it like my my flower is 76.5 and the see that we can get a shot of that pretty cool kind of fun you just put it in check the temperature of your oven your wall whatever a lot of fun so anyways you will need 380 grams of water at your correct temperature so that will be this is again where grams is really good that would be one and a half cups plus one and a half tablespoons of water please get a scale so um put a you want a well in the center and we're just going to pour our water in like so and then we're just going to moisten our flour I like to use one of these just one of these plastic scrapers you could use a wooden spoon and then I'm just gonna move it around like this now we are making an authentic French baguette so I will tell you upfront there is a technique to this and it will take some practice but this is a crap and a wonderful one and I just love the process and if we're not making like just a white bread dough in them and then just rolling it into a log we're not really going to you know make it like they do in bakeries so and you know what the results are just wonderful so enjoy learning this it's a craft I just I just find it so therapeutic and relaxing and even if it's not perfect the results will be like I find even on my worst day there's my bread is still better than what I'm getting at my local grocery store so so now I've kind of got it moistened as much you know as I can you finding it looks like a lot of water and then it looks like I don't have enough water you do so now what we're gonna do we don't want to knead this dough so I have this violence bench scraper metal you could just use a knife we're not you don't want to tear the dough so what you're gonna do is just cut down so you could use a knife for this and then just lift this and stack it you don't want to pull it so just work like this work around and this as we keep working this it's going to moisten get all that flour moistened so as you can see here that I'm really starting to really clean the bowl of the flour say I'm kind of dragging it up so check that in a second yeah okay so there we got it's kind of a shaggy mess don't worry about it and I'm just gonna check it that looks good you want to kind of just feel it make sure there's no dry spots that's look I'm happy with that okay so now what I'm gonna do so we're done making our dough I know it doesn't really look like a dough very good one but trust me it will let's take it out so I'm just going I have to wash my bowl and so I'll do that and I'll be right back okay so now I have my clean bowl I'm just gonna pour a little flavorless oil I'm actually using canola oil vegetable light olive oil now I'm just taking a paper towel and then just lightly oiling the inside we don't want our door to stick too much and then so I'm just gonna take my dough like so and then I'm gonna flip it so that the the top of the the dough is oiled and there that looks lumpy kind of shaggy don't worry about it and look just for we are at 74 which is like if the low-end of our temperature which is good 74 which is what 23 see so that's good so now I'm just going to cover it with plastic wrap and then like I said if you don't need your dough a lot the kind of the thing is if you knead your dough a lot you have a short fermentation period conversely if you don't need your dough you have a long fermentation period and as we're going to do it for three hours and that's gonna really develop the flavor of our baguette but every 45 minutes we will have to stretch our dough which I will show you so what you want to do is just let this sit at room temperature and I'll see you back here in 45 minutes okay so it's been 45 minutes so we're going to do what is called our first fold and you know it just is a little tip I kind of write everything down the time time I made the dough and then my folds because sometimes you can forget what time you did it so it's good to have a little piece of paper and put that down so now to hold our dough what you do is take one end here just kind of stretch it gently and then fold it over onto itself turn it stretch this fold it back on itself this side and as you can see this is starting to smooth out this is what we want and like that and then we're going to do is just flip it over so bottom becomes the top and that's what is called our first fold if I kind of put my thing on there it's up to 75 0.5 which is wide about 24 so that's fine because we want to keep that within that range so now I'm just going to cover and the reason we do that is to equalize the temperature of our dough that stretching helps to do that so I'm just gonna cover it and now we're going to do another 45 minutes and then do what is called our second fold so we'll see you back then so it's been 45 minutes so we're going to do what is called our second fold again gently pull it fold it on a South another side and as I said this will equalize the temperature of our dough as you can see and then we're just gonna flip it it's getting nice and soft just how we want it so again that's all you do cover it and we let it ferment for another 45 minutes so now for our third and final fold now this dough looks I mean it's nice and soft but it is sticky so that is the way it's supposed to be so again just gently pull fold it over itself and yes again flip it and then we are going to cover it and let it sit another 45 minutes and then we will be ready to start shaping our baguettes before we start shaping our baguettes we need to talk about our oven and one of the problems home bakers have always had to make an authentic French baguette is we don't have a deck oven which is what artesian bakeries use but we can kind of simulate it and get really good results so in the oven I have actually two pizza stones I have one at the top here and I have one at the bottom I have if you don't have to I have done it with just the bottom one and that is what we're going to put the baguette on and I get pretty good results some people have even just bought unglazed tiles instead of a pizza stone the problem with that is I've talked to people and they said they do tend to break so just keep that in mind so um and then you have that and then you know the deck ovens in artesian bakeries what the great thing of that is when you put the baguettes in there you get this burst of steam and you need that so that's what how you get that really nice hard crispy crust but we also there is a way to kind of send me like that and what I've done is I've put a cast-iron frying pan in the bottom and we're gonna heat that up with the stones when we heat the oven and then what we're gonna do is we're going to throw in some ice cubes and that's going to instantly hit that cast iron we're gonna get to steam so this is kind of my setup that I have like I said if you only have one pizza stone you can you can do it with that so uh and the thing is we want we have to preheat our oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit which is 245 degrees Celsius and we want those stones to get up to that temperature and that takes a while you know your your oven made beep and say it's ready but those stones take a lot longer I find to really get that up to to temperature it takes like an hour and a half so just keep that in mind when you're timing and if you have a convection oven a fan oven which I do I like to turn that off I don't like I don't have the fan on so just keep that in mind so when we come back we will start shaping our baguettes okay so now we're ready to start shaping our baguettes I like to do this in two stages do a little then let it rest and then finish shaping so first thing we need to do is flour surface because this is a soft it's a sticky dough and then what you want to do is you want the top of the dough to be facing down on your counter like so as you can see it's really nice and soft and then flour the top and then we're gonna divide from the where they sit we're gonna make three baguettes so we're gonna divide this into thirds now I like my scale should probably know you can eyeball this if if you don't have a scale so I my finds both 310 grams per big a so and you know try not to tear you want to just cut down and use a knife if you don't have one of these bench scrapers and just gather up the dough look and kind of go like this because you don't want to stretch it if you've ever made a baguette dough like with the Machine like and knead it this dough is a little more soft than then then a machine made when you need it but you know I think this is a great dopher if you're just starting to make big s because you don't have to worry about needing it and you know the window do I have that right and people get confused by that so I think this is a great way to start and then we move on to the other ways and see if that's all right okay that's right so now there's my oven beeping so you want to kind of put it into a rectangle kind of even and then kind of Pat it down cuz you're gonna have some large air bubbles and we just want to get rid of those so I'm doing it what's in maybe six by four inches so that's let me see well it's 16 by 10 centimeters it's not too critical so what we're gonna do - it's a little bit of technique here we're gonna take your hands like this and then just fold it into the center kind of seal it because we're trying to create a little bit of tension here on our our dough and that will give us that really nice shape of a baguette that won't spread out when it bakes so that's why we're doing and then just again just take this and fold it over and under and so that's what you forgot and then I'm gonna put that underneath and then I'm just gonna take my palms of my hands and kind of just go like to rock it back and forth and we're getting some tension there and then we're sealing that at the bottom like so and that's what you're looking for not that difficult and then what we want to do is just have a board or a baking sheet really whatever you have I'm just gonna use my wooden board here and just put that on there like so and just do the same thing just paddocks we want to get rid of to even out you want to kind of have an even thickness of your dough plus to get rid of there's any of the really large air bubbles but don't like really don't take out your anger and then let's add into the center seal it and then like that and then just rock it back forth and that's what you're looking for and same thing with the third one okay if you have any big one just pop those little big air bubbles and then we have it on our board and then I'm just gonna cover with plastic wrap now I'm just gonna you know let it relax our dough relax for about a half hour and then when we come back we'll do our final shaping of our big s so now we're ready for our final shaping of our baguettes so you can see they're nice and soft they have spread a little so what I want to do is lift them up and top goes down onto a floured counter so now I know in in a bakery baguettes are really long at home we are limited by the size of our oven and the size of our pizza stone so uh I'm going to make about 14 inch long baguettes that's about 35 centimeters so what you will need is a cloth I'm using just a linen tea towel if you want to do like the bakeries do they have they use a cloth called a Koosh you can actually buy them online but you know a linen tea towel clean lint it out just do the same thing and I like to lightly flour that so our dough does not stick so a little bit of technique here you know it takes practice you know you won't get stuck down first time and don't worry about it because it does you know it'll still turn out fantastic it's just something it's a craft something to work on it's kind of fun so now what we're going to do is just Pat our dough down gently kind of even get an even shape and if you have any large air bubbles we want to get rid of those now what we're gonna do is fold from the top over 1/3 and you do you do this by I take my left hand and I have my thumb and I just bring kind of take the dough and lift it over my thumb and then you can either use your heel of your right hand or just your fingers I'm going to press down to seal so just go along pressing pressing pressing we want to see all not get some tension and just you know a lot of times I just use like so and then we flip it around and we're going to do the same thing use your thumb and a third again all the way along so seal it that gets some tension gives us that a nice shape and then we're going to take again and go all the way over to the end here and seal it again I'm just using so it's a third a third and a half just remember that a third turned the dough another third and then a half and I don't you probably can't hear but there is some air bubbles breaking and then I have it sealed as you can see that's what we want and now what we're gonna do is we want to roll it gently to about 14 inches 35 centimeters or however long you know your pizza stone is you got a bigger one you can do it longer and then just gently roll it out that's I'm I think that's about 14 so what we want to do you can see there's that seam try to get it you know Nathan shape so we want seam side up you're putting it on the cloth kind of have and what we're going to do is just take the cloth and then to kind of give it a little thing to keep its shape as because we are going to let it proof a little so just kind of like that and then we're gonna do it again with the next one if you don't get it the perfect first time do not worry just do it the best you can practice makes perfect so again third over pop those air bubbles like sitting just kind of turn it again third seal it and then a half what bit air bubbles there I'm popping and if you don't if that's not just kind of take your fingers and make sure it's nice and sealed get the tension there of the nice shape and then just gently roll it get it as even as possible seam side up and and then just again it's a third one so that's our final one it's like so and then I'm just gonna cover it and we're just gonna let it sit at room temperature now depending on how warm your room is mine's at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit 25 degrees C so I'm I do about a half hour if your rooms a little cooler it could be an hour what you want is when you press your baguette pred gently press it it will pop up slowly so probably about a half an hour and we'll be back and we'll bake our baguettes so we are now ready to bake our baguettes I'm using a pizza paddle because we have to transfer the baguettes into the oven if you don't have one of these you could you just turn your a large baking sheet upside down and then what I did is I just spread some fine cornmeal because that way the baguettes will slide a little easier into the off of the board into the oven you can use semolina for that so I'm just gonna rub that in okay and now we're going to trim little tricky here transferring the baguettes to the board we want as I if you remember we have the seam side up we want now to put the seam side down on bort I'm using one of these this is actually just a piece of wood to transfer them you know you can use like a cutting board piece of just got a piece of plywood and a little tricky little technique I'm gonna lift this up and what we got to do is kind of flip it back and forth so I'm going to use kind of get my wrong side there get this under and then I'm going to flip it back and then flip it onto the board using the cloth and then you have that seam up and then transfer it seem down that's what you're going to do so now what we need to do is do those this kind of characteristic slits on the top of our baguettes you want to try to keep it in that top like the third of the top of your baguette I'm using actually using a razor blade you could use a sharp knife some people even use scissors so what you want to do is I'm for this length of baguette I'm going to do three slashes and if you can see here there is a slight overlap that's what you want so just kind of I think three is it's kind of time and we wanted fairly deep as you can see just quick action down like I said you could use the knife for this and that looks good so we are ready to transfer these to our piece of stone in the oven and you will also need I have on the side you will need some ice cubes about a cup and a half of ice cubes 306 I guess that's one 360 you're just a bunch of ice cubes and that's going to create that steam and we need that because we don't want the crowd we want the crust to be really crisp and you need that steam rate at the beginning so let's see if we can do this try to space can't really see me try to space your baguettes you don't want them too close together because otherwise the sides will be soft so leave a little space like so you can see that it's low right and then I'm just going to try to do that as quickly as you can I know it's a little difficult and we're going to bake those at 425 minutes until we get really nice and golden-brown and nice and crispy if you turn one over and kind of tap it it will be Hollow I mean normally my about twenty-five minutes now if by any chance you cannot fit all three in there which sometimes happens what you can do is kind of  the the unbaked baguettes while your first one is baking just so what you need to do is just put them on a baking sheet and put them in the fridge and then you can bake them off after your first one is done if you have that problem so 25 minutes and then we will have a beautiful baguette [Music] [Music] okay there's our big s aren't they gorgeous beautiful golden brown kind of tap them a little hot they're Hollow so that's just what we want and you know what's great about big ad should do a few they're all they all look different kind of and you can evaluate them I you know nice ears here some maybe not and then so then next time you know whether you should cut if they're you don't have good ear maybe you didn't cut deep enough or if they're really ragged maybe you didn't pull your ear razor or your knife fast enough through so it's kind of fun to just experiment learn the craft enjoy it so now I know we're smelling the brand it smells wonderful and who doesn't like hot red nice warm from them but please resist it ah to get the full flavor of your baguette it has to cool to room temperature sorry to say that but that's what we have to do so I'm gonna let them cool aunt like this on a wire rack it's probably going to take you know maybe a couple hours but when we come back we will try one okay so now we're ready to cut into our baguette so I like to use the serrated knife some people just like to tear off the chunk either way I don't know whether you can hear that sound lettuce so I love that sound oh so this is the inside of our bag app as you can see I mean it's wonderfully soft you have the crisp outside crust the soft interior and you can see they're fairly large air pockets in there that's because our the way we made our dough it was very soft and gassy and that's why you get this the holes in the finished product and okay you don't need to have butter on it I like it plain but you know I like butter too it's very good if you can if you have some pesto that's nice on there too you can tell I had chew a lot it is soft it's true in that wonderful crisp outside crust you know this I like making baguettes this way I mean you can make there's so many different ways you can use a stirrer like a foolish or a sponge but you know what to start out this is a really easy way to kind of get get going on making a big gets so try it and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "7jx_JH69YPQ": "hi today we plan on making rustic baguettes and when I say rustic it's gonna be is where you have a traditional baguette which would be flour water salt yeast or if you do it with a pre ferment of poolish in general this is going to add one more complexity to it actually to where this is going to have not only polish but it's also going to have a Levon and then just to make it a little bit more deeper flavor than you would normally put 3 percent whole wheat flour in there as well now with the whole wheat flour or any other additional flour flavor you can do you can do 1 to 3% depending on the strength of it like corn flour or if so even when you do something like that or even this whole wheat it's it's relatively cool to take it and give it a little bit of a roasting so you can put it on a sheet pan put it in the oven very very specifically watch it kind of flip it around a little bit it only take probably 30 seconds or something but if you do that you can add even a deeper flavor today I'm just gonna go with just the 3 percent whole wheat 97% white flour then I've got a white liquid Livan and a white polish okay and then of course salt little pinchy a still even though it's gonna be leavened much with the the pre ferments hmm but it's also gonna be at what's the 0.2 percent on commercial yeast alright so here I first want to show what the Levon and the poolish look like and show you when they're at full strength and when you want to use them so right so what we have on the left is the poolish and you can see this almost it goes between double and triple it's that's height and volume after you first mix it and when it comes to full of maturation it's going to come up and then just start to slightly recede and you can see where it's slowly coming down here and you can you have about maybe a two hour window from when that's very very - when it's going to start to kind of lose its its strength and then on the Levon which is our white liquid Levin on the right side here that's very similar this will continue to ferment you've got a longer window to use several hours - for even six hours depending on the temperature of the room and such so when you have the two and you combine the two together you're gonna get that wonderful extensibility that you gave it to poolish and then you get the that kind of strengthening and then also that Chu with the Levon we're only gonna go with a small percentage of the Levon with the majority of the percentage come from the poolish for the reason that again you're looking for a light and airy baguette but to give it that a little bit more of a country your rustic flavor to it with the Levon with the Chu with the strength you'll still get that wonderful cell structure but you're going to get that that that deeper flavor all right so let's so let's get back and we're gonna start scaling this off and mixing okay so with the poolish the best way to go about kind of removing this from the container take your water kind of run it around the edge is the best and it'll loosen it up enough to just kind of slide out all right all right you get the majority of that out right in the beginning all right now I need to scale off 209 grams of the liquid LaVon okay so that's coming in at about 14% when I do that so it's just adding that that touch of LaVon yes and then all we're gonna need now is dries as well as you know salt yeast alright a little bit of the remaining water as well of course now this is all does that have mixed so far in these videos it's gonna be a slow mix and this still doesn't have any enrichment so there's no additional fats so the best way to go about this especially on a KitchenAid mixer mix it at a long slow speed with the bulk fermentation do some folds to build up the strength the mixer itself will not develop the dough in the way that doesn't damage all right so best way to use this much more of your hands after you get the incorporation stage which is during the first six seven minutes so it's gonna mix just again about six seven minutes I'm gonna come back looking for a target temperature of about 75 to 77 degrees and and then we'll see alright so we got about six and a half minutes or so looks like this is developing pretty well I didn't really want to go any further and the one concern that I always have mixing on these kitchen aids is the friction so the dough temperature can get too high if I mix it for too long so again we're looking for between 75 77 degrees yeah and again yeah that's so I'm at at 78 degrees a little bit higher than I you know would normally be projecting but it's not an issue it's not out of control but again that that friction and that's continuing of development is not necessary and so with this dough we're gonna bulk ferment for approximately an hour and a half maybe an hour and 45 minutes okay and again depending on your dough temperature this is not necessary to fold but I'm just gonna kind of put it in a position that it's together better and what we're gonna do with this I'm more than likely going to fold this at about 45 minutes okay so let it ferment come back check it again again each and every time you mix the dough and when you do it more consistently you'll know what to expect but you have to get a feel for what the dough is gonna do and what you're expecting it to happen in the you know the next hour - - so each and every time you do this pay attention whether you need a fold or you don't need a fold or if you need to hurry up on the timing and such okay so going in at about 45 minutes the dough is coming along very nicely it's gonna be let me say about an hour and a half total but what I want to do is give a fold because it's not coming out of the mixer enough to be that way so all right so again just a nice long stretch all four directions okay looks very nice so given both the fold the length of the fermentation the acidity everything these are the things that helps to build up the overall strength so with very nice dough come back in about another 45 minutes and divide okay so we've get an hour actually about 45 minutes this time around and the dough looking very volume is very very nice looking forward to the way this turns out so we're gonna divide this and pre-shape as you would for baguettes and it's it's essential and how you do this the care and the steps taken when making baguettes there's a reason they use this to judge the quality of competition and bakeries and such so technique is everything this okay so now as you see this very very lively dough that's we're gonna handle with care and we're gonna divide at 280 grams that's approximately ten ounces the oven when you're baking at home the most most ovens are being basically the same for each there's only fifteen inches deep so I can't make a full baguette okay you can't load it baguettes sideways intern ovens don't even try the length of this is going to be about probably 12 13 inches so I've reduced the weight that you would normally scale a full-size baguette to like I said 280 grams which is approximately 10 10 ounces right try to cut little rectangles little squares that don't have too many pizzas added to it all right so all right cut the long strip try to cut again approximate to the size and don't cut directly on the scale so you don't damage the scale itself okay so when pre shaping that's why you need to get kind of the rectangle square we're just going to give a light little fold over to make a log okay and we're doing so with you know a very gentle touch all that gas retention that's happened during the first fermentation we want to retain it and then we'll deal with it later after we're shaping so again it's just a very gentle like now if your dough is very loose you can pre shape a little bit more aggressively to build up additional strength okay but this dough has approximately 67 percent hydration between the mixing and the folding that's all been coming along nicely so that's not something I need to worry about we're gonna let these relax for about 20 minutes and then come okay so we're gonna shape these have had a chance about 20 minutes to relax again it's it's very the steps in the process to get to making of them you know very good baguette is giving it the time the attention the detail as you're doing it it's not hard it's just kind of follow the process go along with it gentle hands all the way through and as we shape this okay you're just gonna again kind of release it from table these are a little bit smaller obviously this needs to be more like demi baguettes but we're just gonna kind of fold over and I'm gonna press in with my thumbs more than anything okay and just give it a light little fold and then okay it's seal it all right now you want to release it from the table before you start to shape so if my seam is here and I'm going down when you shape its again it's gonna be an even pressure from all fingers as you do this and what I found when you trained a lot of people doing this a lot of people like to stand on one side or stand to the other side tends to get a little bit more tapered this side little fatter this side try to keep with even pressure given that pressure all the way down to the baguette okay so I'm going to taper these a little bit more than I would for like say a traditional baguette for the more rustic look this is also going to be floured on the Koosh with the seam up so that we can have you know a nice coating of flour on the top of the baguette as well all right so again just seam up do that all right same thing again just a gentle fold over press him with your thumbs give it a little bit lease release it from the table now you can actually roll it through a little bit of flour if you need be not too much because you just basically starts sliding it okay and then go in with the taper find your seen okay that's what's important make sure that you have enough room to be able to do this so all right a few more baguettes flour on the bottom seam up all right so we've had final proof at about two hours maybe two hours ten minutes or so and what we're gonna do when we load up the baguettes is cut a couple baguettes and then I'm also gonna cut a couple epi so you'll do a little bit thing where it's it basically kind of creates a baguette into some rolls right so again with transfer peel if you remember these were proofed seam side up guys so we're gonna roll these over [Music] okay so just in general for cutting baguettes this size in particular so it's gonna be three scores four would be a little bit too much you need to get kind of an even length you score overlapping by about a quarter to a third each bag each score and keep it within the shoulder itself okay so now there's a shoulder being the sides there so it has to be overlapping like so okay for Eppie what we're gonna do is take scissors which I'll show you on this packet in particular how to do so if I'm going to score baguette again just it's gonna be three very sharp blade maybe eighth of an inch to even a sixteenth of an inch deep at an angle okay and I have them overlapping but I said about a third right now for an epi what you're gonna have is this it's going to be cutting it a scissors again at about it maybe 45 degree angle if you cut up too high like this when you need to move the bread over it's going to kind of create this little crease so what you want to do is try to get an angle and you're basically going to take your thumb go one direction your finger go the other direction you're gonna go back and forth and cut a piece so it's just gonna be like that a little bit over just let it kind of rest and fall to the side okay it's it's not necessary to force it it'll just come up like that basically what's gonna do is give it just nice kind of a roll and then instead of doing just three scores on a rustic baguette often what you'll end up doing is actually just having one long score so all the way and and just a little flap up all right so when we load this again have to be careful what you're doing steam with some ice and a little bit of water [Applause] you get a really nice result probably the bake on a home ovens about maybe 25 minutes maybe 27 depending on your oven temperature at a bakery you're generally trying to get up around maybe 21 to 23 minutes but this will take a little bit longer so about 25 minutes or so we'll check it out all right it's a rustic baguette the final bake came out very nicely with when you have the poolish you have to live on a little touch of the whole wheats a little bit longer fermentation than you wouldn't it for a you know maybe a straight dough or endo or just a traditional baguette with the pollution you get a little more depth of color a little bit more depth of flavor as well and it's gonna have a little bit chewier crumb okay it's still gonna have a thin crisp crust but it's gonna be a little bit chewier crumb and overall it's just it's just a different approach to making a baguette it's another way to think about fermentation it's another way to think about how to create something in your mind that may be a little bit different so try the ideas put but different preformance different sours different things together don't overcomplicate it that's the main thing just make it a 1 a 2 you know possibly situation maybe a third but that's it don't muddy it up that's the idea but wonderful baguettes okay nice little Demi's that you can do in your home oven I actually had more than this my kids loved eating him so I lost a few on the way but I think you'll do the same as you're making yours the EPI is well very simple to do you got a nice little roll that you can kind of just break off and it actually nice other thing to do with this sprinkled with a little water prior to baking and sprinkle some sea salt on it or even even like an herb or something but sea salt matches so fantastically with it you break it off and it's a nice little roll that you can add to a salad to something of that nature so overall very happy with it follow the videos look at the whole spectrum because each one has been building on another concept so if you watch the whole series that we put together I think this is number 13 you can follow it at Kingdom bread - Tampa at the YouTube channel and then as well at our website which is Kingdom bread - Tampa calm all right so enjoy you", "kyPaygI4OPY": "[Music] you", "oEw3Cb9wXKs": "[Music] hi how's it going guys welcome back to the video alright so today's video we're looking at a resource pack a 6d forced us to put on and download it won't get this and I first my slips to make it okay what is I don't know but my brain is about to explode you you see what I meant now by this is a mess I had what is with these colors that stand oh my yeah I think it is what instruction what oh my god what the actual oh my god let's look at your inventory and holy it looks like so good to lava this is lovely what if you don't subscribe and look in three seconds that will literally become you oh my guess okay Sun look at the Sun oh wow this is like oh my god that's amazing oh through everything and I know some people were kind of mad at me because I didn't look at the weather and erm and their dragon and these kind of stuff so there's so many things that I haven't seen all that yes look at this yeah blot my head what are you looking at everything wait where'd you go I can't see I'm in a cave is that a zombie yeah dude we should so have a pvp battle with this pack no that would be wait what's in a survival world with this two blocks see before you work well wait the redstone looks like a strawberry place it it's yeah walking is strawberry red stones what are these oh my god I don't even know what anything is at this point mess Bazaar pack I've ever seen oh my god my head oh my god I gotta get out of here I'll see you guys I'm going to okay so do you want to have a PvP battle dude I'm thinking 100 right and we have two minutes of invincibility and you're not allowed to use the search okay I'm down so how much time do we have to get stuff let's do hey Siri set a timer for 30 seconds Oh God oh we go are you insane oh my gosh yeah I literally can't tell what's what how are we meant to play like this I'm trying to find the golden apples and I can't even find out what happened to anything this is so bad I can't tell same oh my goodness the food the rock I'm so gonna die dude I can't tell what anything is and I'm literally going to die because of it I forgot to get XP pots can I please decks be no you we don't have it either fine have we started nope we're about not yet well then we get XP no XP my Chi what thanks fees for my enchants no no I don't even have any chance cuz I was like looking and oh my god I was so lost I don't get XP we should start right now okay let's start I can't you wanna go let's go all right where are you guys I completely lost you guys where are you guys coming oh I found you guys okay I'm going blind this is like a tech I got you yes mmm I'm so mad I would have want to find my stupid enchants that is your sword enchanted yes what if I don't want to get well it's not actually get out of here Oh Oh his sword wasn't a chance at he lied so bad place your bets okay halo that is not how this goes die muffin oh god this is lots of all's in it where we gonna have a cave fight ooh oh why didn't I take fall damage okay my finger hurts yeah mine too my stupid finger hurts a lot oh gosh okay are we going deeper in the cave let's do it you're standing on this is never gonna end no literally ah well the armor is pretty you're standing on me so maybe in the next like I don't know 30 seconds it'll end realistic probably I mean I do not have any replacement armor I do not I probably should have thought about that but my hand yeah he's gonna break before that even comes into play and now I eat this I was someone's helmet broke wait I do have replacement arm right bad just give up yeah I am over you are up there goes your boobs and do all my own fire there's no way yes I am dead I will take the double the fire so annoying how are you both still alive I don't know what he's done I can see ya down there okay oh yeah that took a while oh my goodness like I like I didn't see that okay what are some of the other oh that's what the golden apples look like oh that's super ya would have been smart to take some yeah I didn't know okay I'm gonna find the coolest block what even is this there are a lot of dropper okay oh I'm gonna try something guys I'm gonna turn on my shaders 3 2 oh my god how's it like oh it's so cool - you guys have shaders I tried again mine oh my gosh oh my god there's sticky sheep there's literally too much to go through this is crazy alright save the competition another one what 60 seconds to build your house ready it takes these one go alright um why am i using this block because such an efficient house 45 seconds left white only 45 that's ridiculous come on that's the way the muffin crumbles hey that's my saying you can't take by saying I have a nice tree in my house so I should get double the points for that 30 seconds I'm gonna put some of that literally meant to be slaw like all of this looks so cool though right and let's say 15 seconds 15 Skippy give us more no I need more times up in 10 seconds 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 time is up all right let's go look at Bad's house first Oh unfinished house Wow such a great house you go in and there's nothing it looks good I give it 2 of 10 all right let's go to my house we're grading each other's okay we're sure I got a WoW I did this no no well account but where's the entrance well it's actually very fun what you have to do is go over here just like this and then once you're over here you decide that you want to do some parkour because you like doing parkour so what you have to do you cannot get to the end you can do an impossible what you have to do is go here and then you can make this jump and that's some parkour okay no you literally none of these jumps are bombs that's possible besides your house has a big hole in it over here fine let's go Casey's house what is this oh if you look closely you can see through this block is this glass oh I thought it was solid oh no what I grade Skippy's of 1 out of 10 I agreed yours halfway out of 10 no you already gave mine two out of ten fine a sixty will you get my house uh well considering there's no entrance there is there is there is you can use your fist to mine yeah entrance here where here you just started it no I well surely that raises the points oh no I'm closing it there you go no entrance and I'm giving Bad's one I mean it looks like a house it just needs it like if Warren yes what what if you get a hundred dollars yes wait wait no zero but what do you mean it was already looking like this before oh my gosh it looks like oh that's a sign it goes sideways oh no scary your house caught on fire are you kidding me are you kidding goodnight goodnight disconnected", "Xjka_YL_YcI": "It's been an hour that the oven's been preheating. And I'm going to put all three \nbaguettes into my oven at once. Because my roasting lid will go over three at once. So I'm going to use my baguette flipping board. And I'm going to get all three of them \nonto this paper here. And then slide it into the oven at once. It's actually pretty easy. Let's see. Since the seam's on the bottom I'm just\ngoing to slide it off like that. Well it tried to stick a little there. We've got it. Here's our last one. I think I'll make sure to get some... a little bit more on there this time. Scrunch this one just a little because\nit's a little bit long. Brush them off so you can see their nice crusts. When it's done baking. And now we will be scoring. For these baguettes I will do four slashes at a slant down the center of each one of the loaves. OK we've got some pretty nice loaves\n ready to go into the oven. The oven'ss been preheating at 500 degrees. And as soon as I put them in I'll spray them, cover them, and then I'll turn the oven down to 450. So right now I'm going to move the camera over to where you can see me baking.", "p9Kpekhf2lc": "fixing we see calm I want to look over some of the brand new chains we have in our collection and these

the way if you're not following a boy on Instagram what you eatin for Caribbean Putman check it out so after posting a pic on Instagram people like Chris share your recipe know Brad's so here we go we're doing a cheesy garlic bread disclaimer this is not Caribbean nothing really Caribbean about this unless you want to put some scotch bonnet pepper and some seasoning and all kind of thing in there you can certainly do that this one here I'm doing some pasta in the oven so to go with that pasta I usually do some garlic bread on the side you're gonna love this one mine cheesy what snap Korean people love cheese so you should love this one let's get cooking basically in a small bowl you want to put some parsley so that's about a teaspoon of chopped parsley and I have here about four cloves of garlic which I finely chopped with a knife you can crush it you can grate it you can do whatever I like the texture of the chop and one a little fine pieces of garlic I mean it's a its garlic cheesy tools that we're doing so we're mixing mutters we're gonna go in with a bit of olive oil and I'm doing a combination you can do one or the other you can do just olive oil or just butter I am doing a combination of both because I like the flavor from the olive oil and I like the creaminess from the butter and it is a fair amount of butter let's see what that is what we're using to sort of Juris the bread before we go on with all of that cheese and all you want to do now when you need soft butter all you want to do now is to make that into a nice paste and the soft scent of butter is please don't put the butter in the microwave you don't want that butter for separation you let's make that into a sort of a spread I'm all we gonna do next the spread that's onto the onto the bridge we've got the bread all sliced and what I did I have it on a cookie tray lined with tin foil I'm the tourist we're making mess and with the cheese that we're putting on here I'm under still want to have to be cleaning up after I'm just using a spoon you can use a knife if you want and I'm just going to brush this on pretty liberally all over the bread cause we're just going to divide this in half basically the next step I've got mozzarella cheese so it's gonna go on with that mozzarella cheese again being as liberal as you want I mean to see you eating this you determine how much cheese and again not just how much cheese but what type of cheese you like if I had some some aged cheddar I would definitely add some aged cheddar to this since I don't have that each cheddar which I usually used because I like to bite the sort of pick you get from that each cheddar since I don't have any and I mean they say if I have each other I would still use some fresh grated Parmesan but I'm just gonna go a little bit heavier with that grated parmesan on there if you want to use a Romano if you want to use as hiago any sort of cheese that you like using you can certainly go in with that I didn't use any salt because I know this cheese will have enough salt in there the butter or salted butter here it a little bit of more than cheese and this is going on the middle rack in the oven 400 degrees Fahrenheit I just I left back a little bit of that parsley just to brighten things up you know nice and green in the oven 400 degrees Fahrenheit - that's nice and toasty on boy nice just hit - a quick peep at what we have in this garlic bread with rotini pasta a wicked little quick sauce we've got some mozzarella cheese on the top some other cheese inside there and some pieces of Italian sausages if you like pasta if you like Italian this is the way to go watch now garlic bread pasta mmm so there you go friend - took about 10 minutes in the oven if you want to get it at a nice golden color that I got there the last couple of minutes I put it on the broil setting which is about 550 degrees Fahrenheit and I mean I say allow it to cool down which is nice and firm before you cut it into there notice the pieces of burnt cheese on the bottom there that's what I'm talking about I have nothing to clean I just toss that out crissy a Caribbean pot that come not a Caribbean recipe as I mentioned but cheesy garlicky toasted watch how much the close-up watch it recognized [Music]", "IMWdmnYwzqI": "I and welcome to episode number 197 with watts for charred calm despite the long rising times French baguette is really easy to mic to start place a hundred grams of strong white bread flour and 5 grams of yeast in a mixing bowl stir them to combine then pour in the warm water mix this well until combined cover the bowl with cling wrap and allow this to stand for 60 minutes after 60 minutes the yeast will have developed extensively and you'll have a bubbling mess add the remaining flour yeast and salt and mix this in mix this until the dough starts to come together then use your hands to work the dough in the bowl until all of the loose flour has been incorporated into the dough ball turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead this for five minutes until it is smooth and elastic sprinkle the dough with a little flour everytime it becomes too sticky sprinkle flour into the bottom of the mixing bowl roll the dough into a smooth bowl and return it to the bowl sprinkle flour over the top of the dough as well cover the bowl with cling wrap and allow this to rise for 30 to 40 minutes until it has doubled in size once risen don't knock the dough down you want to leave as much air in the dough as possible dump the dough out onto the work surface and using a large knife cut the dough into two pieces working as gently as possible roll each half into a long loaf transfer the loaves to a bake sheet and sprinkle lightly with flour before covering loosely with a damp kitchen towel allow the baguettes to rise for another d minutes after 60 minutes remove the towel and sift a like layer of flour over the top of the loaves using a sharp thin blade

ingredients we need to make some fresh crunchy soft Vietnamese bunny but get 500 grams of bread flour you want to use a flower that has a high protein content we have 8 grains of kosher salt if you using regular salt you need to reduce the amount we have 6 grams of sugar three hundred fifty milliliter of water room temperature and one packet of instant rice is five simple ingredients one great recipe let's get started first step you're gonna combine all of the dry ingredients in your standing mixer we have the bread flour going in the kosher salt the sugar and the instant rice is just combine all of the ingredients attach the kneading hook to your standing mixer turn on your mixer on speed setting number two and then add the water to all of the dry ingredients now you want to mix it for a couple minutes until all of the dry ingredients are well combined once it's all well combined let the dough rest for about two to three minutes once the dough has rested for two to three minutes turn the stunning mixer back on to speed setting number four this time and move the dough for about five minutes let's take a look at the dough in its texture after five minutes of kneading at speed setting number four as you can see the dough is very sticky totally sticks to your hands and it's very wet and that's totally fine at this point of time cover it up and let it rest for five minutes after five minutes of resting we want to turn the standing mixer back on to speed setting number four and we don't on the day for another five minutes after another five minutes of kneading on speed setting number four the dough is still wet and sticky but when you do the stretch test you can stretch the dough to a very thin layer without the door tearing that's when you know the dough is ready to rest so this is what the dough looks like after 60 minutes of resting it has risen beautifully you can see there's a lot of air in there try to get out as much of the air pockets as possible just push the air pockets out when you're done with getting most of all of the air pockets out form it back to a nice round shape put it back in the bowl cover it up put it in the oven again with oven lights on for 30 minutes the dough after the second rise of 30 minutes and once again you want to try to work out as many of the air bubbles as possible once most of the air bubbles are out form the dough back into a round shape that will help divide up the dough into equal portions I divide up my dough into 8 equal portions I'm making some mini pockets you can of course use a scale to make sure that each portion is equal weight I just eyeball it that works for me after all the portions have been divided you work one portion at a time and for me to its final shape now the one step that is really important here is going to be the slapping of the dough onto your working surface if you have a very frustrating day this is really good exercise to let out all of your frustrations slap it onto your working surface or about six seven times that is the key to making the victim respond maybe get to be airy and fluffy and then shape it into its final form I roll them out so that the two ends are a little bit thinner than the center I love the crunchy part so the end parts are actually my favorite and just continue to work so with all of the portions that you have cut once you have shaped all of the dough into its final shape you need to let it rest for a third time the third time is also going to be for about thirty minutes or until your dough has doubled in size so I put it back into the oven for 15 minutes with the oven lights on after 15 minutes I take it out of the oven and let it continue to rise for another 15 minutes on the counter top in the meantime I will preheat my oven to about 450 to 475 degrees Fahrenheit [Music] so this is the final product a beautiful crunchy soft and airy Vietnamese bunny but get mmm it looks delicious I know the shape is not all perfect but I promise you they all taste the same so I'm gonna get these rests for a couple of minutes before I cut them open to show you what the inside looks like now listen to the sound and the crunch of the but yet you can hear how crunchy it is on the outside if you love crunchy bread this is your recipe and look on the inside it's nice and airy and fluffy and it's just to die for we eat Vietnamese baguette too many many different dishes today I will show you how to a sample of Vietnamese says you barbecue pork but me sandwich we have some pickled daikon and pickled carrots nice tangy in crunchy I will show you the recipe to make pickled vegetables in the coming weeks start out with the bread my bread is hollowed out my daughter eat the inside and I can stuff more goodies on the inside put some sliced cucumbers into your pocket the pickled daikon and the pickled carrots some cilantro fresh herbs are really really important in Vietnamese cuisine spicy jalapenos if that's what you like and then the barbecue pork now you see that my homemade sassy barbecue pork does not have the red color that you would normally see with store barbecue pork that's because I do not use any artificial coloring to top off the Vietnamese baguette you want to put some Maggi seasoning on there this is a must you cannot skip the mega seasoning this makes the bottom you forget almost upon me forget you can get these at the Asian stores or even in the American grocery stores nowadays Europen me sandwich is ready to be equal it's absolutely delicious I hope you give this recipe a try if you

"FyIWJG5pxUk": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make\u00a0\nPerfect Homemade French Bread. I've been regularly making this recipe\u00a0\nfor my family for about 12 years now. After hundreds and hundreds\u00a0and hundreds of loaves,\nit's still a family favorite. Today we're going to be making ours in a stand mixer, but you can also do this by hand. This recipe only requires\u00a0a few simple ingredients, starting with 1 1/2 tablespoons\u00a0of instant dry yeast. Then we'll add in 2 cups of warm water, you want it to be just warm to the\u00a0\ntouch like a baby's bath water. If you're using active dry yeast\u00a0\ninstead of instant dry yeast, you use the same amount, but you'll let this sit for about 5 minutes. Then we'll add in 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and we'll start adding in our flour. You'll need somewhere between 4 1/2 and 5 cups. You can always add in more flour, but you can't take it away, so start with a lower amount\u00a0\nand add more as needed. You can use either bread\u00a0flour or all-purpose flour. Both will work in this recipe. We'll get this mixing on a low\u00a0speed, \nand increase the speed slowly as\u00a0the mixture starts to come together. The dough should start to pull\u00a0away from the sides of the bowl, \nand if it doesn't add more flour. You want to end up with a nice smooth\u00a0soft dough that's tacky, \nbut not sticky\u00a0enough that it sticks to your hands. Then we're going to transfer this\u00a0\nto a lightly greased mixing bowl, then cover it with either a\u00a0tea towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise until double in\u00a0size which will take about one hour. Lucky for you I already have one that's ready. You can see it rises quite a bit. Once it's risen you'll remove the plastic wrap, then we'll turn it out onto a clean countertop, and we're gonna divide it in half. Then we're going to roll each\u00a0half into a large rectangle, probably about 12 x 18 inches. Now once you have your rectangle you're\u00a0\ngoing to start rolling it into a tight roll, then once you get to the end I like to roll it back and forth to kind\u00a0\nof seal up the edges and taper it off, then you can transfer these to\u00a0a lightly greased baking sheet. I do one per pan, or if you plan on making french bread regularly\u00a0\nI highly recommend buying a french bread pan. It's $15 or $20 and it has all these holes in it. It'll bake more evenly and give a better crust. So I'm actually going to move\u00a0\nmine over to this special pan, repeat this with the other half of your\u00a0\ndough so that you end up with 2 loaves. We'll cover these and let this\u00a0\nrise for about 30 - 45 minutes. During the second rise get your oven\u00a0\npreheating to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. When you're ready to bake you'll want to\u00a0\ncrack an egg into a bowl and grab a fork and give this egg a good little beating. Then we'll set that aside for just\u00a0a second and grab a sharp knife, then we're going to score the loaves, which means you just do a little maybe\u00a0\n1/4 inch slice directly into the bread. Bread expands as it bakes, and so scoring the dough allows\u00a0some of that energy to be released so that the bread stays in its correct shape. Then grab that beaten egg and we're\u00a0\ngoing to brush it on top of the loaf which will give us a nice shiny crust. An important distinction to make\u00a0\nis that this is French bread, which is actually an American type of\u00a0\nbread that's found in every grocery store, it is not meant to be an\u00a0\nauthentic French baguette. Then we'll bake this in the 375\u00a0\ndegree oven for about 35 - 40 minutes. Once your loaves have finished baking transfer\u00a0\nthem to a wire rack to cool completely. Now technically you're not\u00a0\nsupposed to slice into warm bread. You want to let it cool completely\u00a0\nbefore you slice into it. That is part of the baking process, but I know just how tempting\u00a0\nit is to have a warm slice, so I won't judge you either way. Your loaves are best eaten within 24 hours. Thanks for watching.

teaspoon of active dry yeast I use the red star brand and we're going to using 14 ounces of water okay so this is just regular water from the faucet at room temperature and we're going to also use this which is a perforated baguette pan link is in the description below this is 16 inches by three sets of three inches so you can get up to three different loafs this is going to help shape and form baguettes so first thing we're going to do is we're going to mix our dry ingredients so we're gonna add the salt we're gonna add the yeast and then we're gonna add our 14 ounces of water but first we're gonna make sure we combine everything really well just like you're making cement you want to make sure that everything is well combined before you add the water in there otherwise you're gonna get clumps of yeast and salt not evenly distributed throughout the flour okay now that's evenly just give you that we're gonna add 14 ounces of water let's just mix this up I use a wooden spoon so I can cut through the dough while it's very sticky now this is gonna be a very very sticky dough use a spoon to work the dough and work the dry flour from the side and all we're going to need to do is keep mixing this until it becomes a big shaggy sticky mess in the middle again trying it every little piece of dry flour in here until you've got this very sticky consistency it looks like porridge not gonna be easy to handle it in this form so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna leave it now overnight or if you're gonna go to work you can do it first thing in the morning and do it when you come back and we're going to leave it for a good seven to twelve hours it's very forgiving this dough so you can actually leave it in the time between them so what I'm going to do is I'm going to be good to bed tonight we're gonna put some cling film over this and then we're going to leave it in a in a dry place with no drafts like I put mine in the microwave it just keeps it safe and it doesn't really get disturbed so let's wrap this in clean up and we'll come back first thing in the morning so it's the next morning I've taken out my bread dough from the microwave and it's cling film off and as you can see we've got a very sticky dough it's doing its work puffed up lots of air in there so it's nice and airy let's get this flour plenty of flour we don't want this to stick it would be very hard to handle this dough so you get a little bit up planea flour let's just work this down we're going to move it around get some flour on it so we can get it into a position where we can handle a ball better okay so the flower set up a little bit at moisture on the top it's very hard to handle isto but keep it moving keep the flour on it and you can bring it together so next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna separate this and to make two baguettes so we're gonna use a scale just so we can measure it out by weight so that's 850 grams so I'm gonna split that up when you believe it almost spot-on okay so now we have two equal sized pieces of dough push this one to one side we're gonna start shape so right now I'll form we go keeping those and floured we're gonna start to shape my dough so the technique I use is stretching and slightly rolling so we're basically going to create sticky to get in we're gonna make sure we definitely keep it moving definitely keep those hands flowers until you get your basic chick and you go try to throw it over onto your pan like I said these are 16 inches in length so you form it out do the same thing second piece lift and stretch a little bit of a roll lift and stretch okay what we're gonna do now is leave it for the second rise cover with a tea towel and then we'll come back and see what's happened so once the bread has been proofed for another hour and that's what I am at right now I've just left this for another hour you'll see that we have expanded a little filled up that mold again still roughly the same size we've got another couple of things to do pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit once your ovens preheated I put one of these in or a ramekin we're gonna put some water in here and this is what this is gonna do this is gonna create steam this is what's gonna give you your very crispy crust on your baguette and get that nice snap when it's finished as the bread breaks it's gonna actually expand as well so what we need to do is we need to score it well you can use this tool now basically it's a literally a piece of plastic with a razor blade on it you can get them in wood you can spend a fortune on these this one's very cheap description to go into the description you'll see there's a link for it you can get them on Amazon traditionally doing baguettes you do four scores at a 45 degree angle across the bread what I like to do is I like to go length ways as I say there's a lot of open spring on here and I don't feel that the four give you what you need so we're going to cut that now and make sure you go nice and deep do they're also very sticky but make sure you cut it nice and deep now you do this just before you put it in the oven otherwise your breads gonna sink my oven is already preheated my water bath is already in there and I've got a nice deep cup for the oven spring all right let's put it in the oven and see what happens next okay so the bread has been in the oven now for 25 minutes I've taken it out off the form placed it on a wire rack and let it cool completely do not try and open your bread until it is cooled absolutely completely otherwise it's just going to tear it up when you open it so as you can see you've got some oven spring here and that's why we put the slip right down the middle so it's kept its integrity at the sides I'm telling you if you don't make that split you're gonna have some splitting at the side as it expands in the oven so let's crack this open and we can have a quick look at it all righty don't if you can hear that bland crispy crust okay as you can see we've got a nice light airy crust and a very crisp you can hear that a really crispy crust on the outside perfect for sandwiches perfect for just cutting up as a small piece of bread this is a perfect loaf if you've got any questions drop me a comment in the description below also in the description there's a link for everything I've used here today few tips and notes first this was 25 minutes in the oven your oven may be a little different so you're gonna have to experiment and keep an eye on it second proof times are always different depending on where you are I'm in the desert so it's a little warmer here so my proof times may be a little shorter from somebody that's in a colder a colder area anyway perfect French style baguettes if you liked it please leave a descriptor the comment down below thank you very much", "VFoDP3lsqL8": "whoa chefs today I'll be making Egyptian soft baguette we call it a shrimp start by using 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast with 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of warm water then leave it to proof in the mixer I'll add the activated yeast with 4 cups of flour and 2 tablespoons of powdered milk this is optional if you want to skip it 1 tablespoon of salt 2 cups of warm water 1 tablespoon of vinegar 1 tablespoon of baking powder then I'll mix you may need to add a couple of tablespoons of water or flour depending on the type of flour you're using but before you add anything we will add 6 tablespoons of oil then assess the situation and add accordingly keep mixing until the dough leaves the sides of the mixer [Music] it will be soft and elastic but doesn't really stick to your hands I'll then need the del quickly and shape it into a bowl brush it with some oil and leave it covered to prove for an hour [Music] the dough should be soft and bouncy [Music] after 1 hour I'll dump the dough onto my work surface and shape it into the big lock then divide it and shape it into balls if you want your baguette to be on the bigger size cut the balls a little bigger but these measurements can yield between 12 to 16 loops [Music] after you cut it tuck it under itself and then shape it into a ball here I'm showing you how I'm doing it I'm pushing it up with my palm an assisting it with my thumb rolling it over and it comes out a perfect full then leave the dough to rest for 15 minutes and now we shave it press on it with your hands and shape it into a rough rectangle then roll it and push all the seam to close it tug the sides inside as well and then roll it into the shape and size of the baguette that you want I'll show you again what I mean and I hope that you can see it better [Music] so here what I'm doing is I'm pressing on it and shaping it into rough rectangle then I'll roll it and close the sides tuck it in and then roll it once more to the shape and size that I want keep in mind that when it proves it will double in size make sure you place the seat on the bottom leave the bread covered in a warm place for the second rise for about thirty minutes then brush the top with some oil and make sure there's enough space between each loop then into a 440 degrees preheated oven for about 20 minutes the time will depend on the size of the BRIT when it comes out the bread will be a little bit hard just leave it covered for 10 minutes then enjoy the best smelling and tasting bread view of ever hat it is so soft and fluffy I encourage you you try it and tag me on all social media to show me your recreations if you enjoy the video please help me out by sharing it with your

professional 600 to make soft and delicious mini French baguettes to make baguettes you will need just four ingredients two and a half teaspoons of instant yeast such as Red Star quick rise found at Whole Foods one pound or three and a half cups of all-purpose flour 12 ounces or one and a half cups of lukewarm water and one and a half teaspoons of fine salt step 1 make the dough add three and a half cups of all-purpose flour to the bowl of a stand mixer add one and a half teaspoons of fine salt it's two and a half teaspoons of instant yeast give it a quick stir fit the stand a mixer with the dough hook attachment start the standing mixer on low speed slowly add to the flour mixture one and a half cups of lukewarm water if after all the water is added you see that the flour along the edges is not being incorporated simply stop the mixer and use a spatula to push the flour to the center of the mixing bowl this is sometimes necessary when using the KitchenAid Pro 600 because the large mixing bowl is designed to handle a much larger quantity of ingredients than we are currently using start the mixer again and increase the speed to medium when most of the flour has been incorporated into the dough ball it's time to need increase the mixer to high speed and knead the dough ball for six minutes during the knead the dough will become very sticky if the dough seems a touch too sticky feel free to add a bit more flour at the end of the knead the dough ball will be still sticky and partly wrapped around the dough hook like this time for the first rise transfer the dough ball to a well floured surface pull the edges of the dough to the center like this a nicely shaped dough ball helps us get a good rise flour the dough ball on both sides then transfer to a large mixing ball seam side down cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel plastic wrap works great for easy cleanup place the dough in a warm or sunny spot and let it rise until doubled in size this will take one to two hours after doubled in size it's time to shape the baguettes many recipes call for transferring the shape to baguettes to a well floured towel or a baguette tray we find parchment paper to be equally effective and easier for cleanup cut a large sheet of parchment paper and make a fold widthwise every four to five inches this creates space for each baguette to rise without risking getting stuck to its neighbor with your parchment paper ready let's begin transfer the dough ball to a well floured surface flour both sides well and divide the dough into six equal pieces for each piece of dough shaped like this flatten the dough into a rectangle about a third of an inch high pull the edges of the dough to the center repeatedly alternating sides stretching the dough lengthwise it's actually really fun and surprisingly easy when you get the hang of it to make shorter baguettes as shown here stretch the dough until it reaches a length of seven to eight inches we love shorter fatter baguettes which are great for sandwiches and have more of the soft chewy Center for which the baguette is famous but if you prefer longer thinner baguettes stretch the dough until it reaches 10 to 11 inches flour well and transfer to the parchment paper here's an even closer look [Music] repeat until you have six perfectly formed baguettes you may even want to divide the bagasse between two cookie sheets cover the baguettes loosely with plastic wrap or you will flower towel and now it's time for the second rise let the form two baguettes rise until doubled in size about another hour after the second rise transfer the baguettes to the cookie sheets you plan to use to bake since handling and picking up the baguettes tends to result in them deflating using parchment paper is also a great way to separate and transfer the baguettes without touching the actual dough using the parchment paper you can simply cut around each baguette and position using the parchment paper without touching the actual dough finally it's time to bake score each baguette four to five times with a sharp knife in a preheated 500 degree oven place a dish below the rack or racks where you intend to bake the baguettes immediately after placing the baguettes in the oven throw two ice cubes into the dish the ice cubes will produce the scene necessary to create a chewy inside any crispy outside close the oven door and drop the temperature to 475 degrees bake for six minutes then flip the baguettes if you're baking two cookies she's over at a time now is also the time to swap the cookie sheet positions on the wraps remove the top cookie sheet to the bottom rack and vice versa to offer even cooking as you flip the baguettes the parchment paper will likely come off and that's fine just remove it from the oven bake the baguettes for another five minutes after the five minutes the baguettes are considered par baked which means they are baked enough to freeze after cooling or you can even eat the baguettes par-baked if you prefer the baguettes softer as we do if you prefer your Bhagat's crispy turn them over one more time and bake directly on the oven rack for five more minutes if baking par baked frozen baguettes finish them off by baking them directly on the oven rack at 450 degrees for 10 minutes enjoy as a gourmet sandwich bread or as a side to soup or pasta [Music]", "YsL6w1e7t9M":

French baguettes you will need four ingredients to do that it's very simple you will need water white flour yeast and some salt an additional thing you might want to have is a baguette pan which makes it easier to bake nice baguette now we are going to put 2 cups of water 2 teaspoons of salt and we are going to mix until the salt is fully dissolved in the water so the salt is really dissolved in the water we can add the yeast sprinkle the yeast and again 3 dissolve the yeast in the water this is how it should look like when everything is cool it is solved so now we are going to put the flour in the liquid so one cup first and then I mix two with the handle of a spoon so it's really like mixing just wetting the flour basically don't worry if you see lumps it's just fine and then we prepare my first cup but I will just add it a little bit at a time because depending of the brand of flour you have it may get wet differently so you might need a bit more or a bit less of flour so you have to look at the aspect of your dough so your dough will remain very wet and sticky and it's perfectly normal it's how it should look like okay so this is good now so now I will put my do on the mat and go going throw up the dough so flour on my fingers and poke holes in the dough then I flip it and poke holes again I flip it the other way and again and I would do this a few times four five six times until it has a nice consistency basically that I feel that I can lift it and put it back in in the ball okay I think it's ready now I'm going to put my dough in the ball to let it rise Coffee hours so you can see that it's still very sticky I put it in the ball one more time I will poke holes in the dough this and I'm going to cover the ball with a wet towel and I will let it stand for three to four hours until the dough has doubled in volume here with the dough after four hours of rising time so now I'm going to transfer it on the mat and I'm going to shape it into baguettes so I'm going to cut it in four equal parts so that we can make four baguettes so now I'm going to take my dough and shape it in the shape of the baguette just stretch basically and I'll put some more flour so that it doesn't get this Tiki and and then when gets the nice shape of a baguette I put it on my pan now I'm going to cut the dough and I'm going to do this as you can see with scissors because it makes it very easy but you can use as well a sharp blade has been created to 420 Fahrenheit so approximately 220 Celsius I have put addition with water inside so that there is your millet inside and just before putting the baguettes in the oven I'm going to scrape on water to create even more humidity and this is what is going to make the crust very crusty and now I'm going to bake the bread for 25 minutes and you just have to keep a close look and see depending on your oven if it looks like it's ready after 20-25 minutes and here come the baguettes with the treat very nice crusty it's so good so now it's your town Thank You Maya", "-mU0HLChQ4M": "visiting with Huell Howser is made possible through a generous grant from the Ralph M Parsons foundation well hello everybody I'm Huell Howser

this place not only is the food wonderful and the atmosphere is great but when you come here you'll be helping an honest-to-goodness American success story come true that's what this is really all about congratulations we've had an absolutely wonderful morning and here at mr. baguette from mr. baguette to chocolate you never know what you're gonna find in LA right now we're on the corner of first and Beverly and we are getting ready to do a story on the French Korean chocolate connection is that right that's totally right it's a French Korean venture I'm Chuck in chocolate I am only the chocolate talker but my wife is the chocolate maker along with your daughter okay so you are the chocolate maker your name is white zone and your name he dumb and you are Christian the spokesperson well the French spokesperson for all of this through here because we're talking about chocolates you have a chocolate shop here yes and chocolate is a lot harder than most of us think it is to make is totally it's a question of temperature mainly you constantly have to monitor your work if you stop in the middle of the process most of the time you will have to start again from scratch as you can see now my wife is molding an egg for Easter and she has to do that three times first time she is just putting a little bit of chocolate around to get the shape let me say that again so she's putting the chocolate inside the mold just to create a shell just to create the shell up so what happens to that and then we will do that two or three times to have the right thickness of the shell oh look now that's what it is this just the shell this is just the shell as you can see this is empty now is that gonna be and they all will be filled with an assortment of our chocolate and new flavors that we will put on the market for these occasion of Easter what is it the texture that she has been she has been to school for almost five years in Paris Angela's working on choking on pastry and chocolate and then starting with pastry and then specialising in chocolate and she also has worked with the most well known or best professional in this area in Paris also so she really knows her stuff she knows her chocolate he knows of chocolate absolutely I've been coming here for probably about four years and had you ever tasted chocolate like this before no that's why I keep coming back how do you describe it to people who haven't tasted this kind of charm we're very intense chocolates mm-hmm they're very special chocolates they are ones that you taste it once and you crave them and you want to come back and get more and so I always come and buy some for myself I pick up one just to read but then I only just one thing this is one piece just for me then I take the growth I could take in some of these back to some other sure you are sure it's hard to just eat one piece it really is because they are very good they're very rich and the very flavorful does it help knowing that you see it being made right here in the store you know who making it and how there might be well I think that that's that's probably most of it because there's so much love that goes into making this chocolates well pull out a good piece of what do you get when you come in here everything is delicious but I personally a dark chocolate how did you did you have to go through all of this chocolate too sure it was a labor of love no the the Russian noir that's my favorite Joey feek French taste this or Shinhwa is really a big fuss about this tell me what's in it then I'll have him tell us what's in it it's a I taste hazelnuts is that correct I taste hazelnut I taste bittersweet chocolate and something crunchy besides hazelnut I don't know what that is good yeah this is what we call 13 or Royalton or whatever depending upon the brand but it's like you know this kind of very light sheen cookie like a dried crab that you may find with your ice cream is a little bit this kind of crunchiness so it's very light and it's extremely flavorful because you have a lot it's a bunch of nuts in there make sure mouth explode it's phenomenal it's really difficult to describe you will have to try it wow you taught me everywhere oh my god I thought I had eaten chocolate before oh I appreciate that you say now you really know something isn't that delicious and try to find the words to describe it you it's beyond cold see that's all he's reduced to you can't the English is just a colossal case of this available oh yes permanently and we always feel as a kids when it becomes everyday everyday well that's been it thank you very much the name of the story is the name of the store is the manufacturer is lofty soldiers shkolu the option of the chocolate first and Beverly basically absolutely and when you come here you've got all of this chocolate the cheese from its home made right here in the back I've only had one piece but I'm already hooked well that's it on the corner of first and Beverly all you ever wanted to know about good chocolate fresh chocolate homemade chocolate right here on the corner first in Beverly visiting with Huell Howser is made possible through a generous grant from the Ralph M Parsons foundation", "Zm_UMT5HNQM": "all right we have another soccer star joining the show not you taylor this is sebastian soto joining us now on sportsnation thank you so much for joining us and we are just so excited with the olympics coming up and all that you guys have ahead just to talk to you about this and the us men's national team is really starting to come together come to life and this is a country that hasn't been in the olympics the past two times so why do you guys feel like this is the team this is the unit that can possibly break through um well first off thank you guys for having me thank you so much this is pretty cool um i just started that today and i answered that question honestly uh i don't want to say anything but we we feel very confident and i think we have the right motivation behind us to keep pushing that the past of what that the nation has gone through in the u.s soccer for the past few years and just what we're showing ourselves and who we are today i think i think we have the right confidence and to be fair it really is motivation to do what we need to do sebastian you speak about that confidence i think a lot of the excitement outside the sport and outside of that group is a lot of the young players playing at a high level like yourself in europe today there was massive news with eunice musa declaring to play for the united states over england you yourself had to make that difficult decision i know chile was after you last september however you decided to play for the united states what went into that decision and more importantly are you surprised at all that eunice has made his uh personally for me it was kind of um speaking to my family and ultimately a decision came from me was this is a nation i've represented for for years it's it's somewhere i was born and raised i got friends and family and to be to be fair it doesn't lessen any of the honor that i had to make a decision like that at all and truthfully with eunice i don't think it was a surprise at all i think he he blended in so well with us he felt like just another brother that we've had for years so to be fair it's it's pretty cool we got to know and i've sent him a congratulations and i'm sure he's really happy you got to love just like the unity between teammates right like that's just the love that you end up sharing and we get to know our teammates pretty well here on set as well weird things like taylor not liking green skittles so he has our production assistant throw them all out beside before the show it's a whole mess but besides all of that what is a weird tick that is uh within one of your teammates that y'all end up clowning eventually oh okay all right i got one i don't know why it just hit me right there okay so i've so for instance um i i don't know if he watches this but so sergey know for instance i've noticed junior for a long time a lot of us have actually known virginia for a long time since u-17s um for one thing sergino can't be on time but the we the weirder thing and we've told him this sergino he eats baguettes for like he only eats a baguette before a game and we even in wales when we had we had good food in wales but this guy sergina would it was um so it was me him uh eunice and tyler at the table and we were just telling bro why are you only eating bread like anything like nothing on there sebastian just straight the baguette sometimes sometimes she would uh he would make himself a little a really dry sandwich really dry sandwich and but he would ask the people to like in his little funny little accent he would say can i can i get a baguette to go and oh they would get in a whole baguette and he'd take it to his room and i'd say bro you really don't eat and he would tell me hey bro card carb up bro all right well that's just the tip i mean there's probably a thousand ticks that we got caramel yeah hold on sebastian you know as well as i do that if messi's eaten baguettes before barcelona games that's exactly what all of us would be doing you'd be doing the same thing too and and we don't know he just said we don't know it's amazing like mix in a little protein right something overrated oh it was hilarious all of us were like dude that's it so hold on no now i'm gonna ask you to be self-aware if we were talking to your teammates about you what's one ridiculous thing that no one knows anything about no all right all right there's nothing ridiculous going on with me there's nothing ridiculous that's for us to decide yeah i don't i mean i guess so i guess so i mean you can ask some of my teammates but um that's ridiculous i don't know man i'm really in the war zone i guess playstation like i got some of the guys that i'm playing with here playing squads and we get knocks on the doors some of the teammates are like dude calm down because we're just screaming okay but so that's just what's to kill the death ratio though like are you actually like out here oh i'm flying i'm carrying all right i respect it so let's spin this thing back to the field man you're out here balling for norwich city at the moment looking at potentially getting promoted up to the epl uh within a year or so and what is the excitement level surrounding that and do you plan to stick around there yeah yeah so um at the moment i mean guys are killing it right now obviously i'm not there to play any games or even train at all but taking care of business to be honest and even though i was alone at holland i was watching every single game so eager to get that work permit to come back and so fortunate that it happened in january and showed up and just started putting my head down on grinding and training trying to prove the coach everything that i can do but the environment right now is just amazing i mean getting getting promoted it's it's everyone's goal at the moment and we're just not trying to get too ahead of ourselves taking every single game and every single training step by step and yeah hopefully happens sebastian you touched on how important home was to you you are from carlsbad i'm from manhattan beach by the way so socal represent but you started your career with the san diego surf so you have deep roots down in socal i'm curious are you a fan of any of the other pro teams in san diego like padres the goals the uh hockey team i mean do you rep any of the she was going to say chargers sebastian but she because you were gonna say chargers don't lie i know you've been in england for a while are you mad at the chargers i've been gone for a bit but not that long okay but uh when i was younger uh i tried to support padres when i was younger it was tough it was tough but uh who was it the picture tony hoffman i think it was is that his name trevor hoffman yeah tony's his cousin this is no it's why not but it's not but no i mean to be fair my my life was surrounded by football so it was that's kind of all that was on the tv that's all i ever did that's all my family ever did so i think to be fair i mess up his name because i wasn't so involved okay not the chargers kind of football not the chargers kind of football so you get one person to have a baguette with who would it be athlete-wise um athlete wise i'd go messy i'd go messy just make sure there's some gray poupon on the side yep just make sure there's some water nearby so you don't joke sebastian soto good luck during qualifying my man thanks for joining us yeah thank you guys thank you guys so much for having me thank you good luck well thank you very

Today I am going to teach you how to prepare\n\"Sfilatino\", delicious Italian baguette bread. The recipe is Franco Galli. Chef of the chain\nAmerican restaurant called \"Il fornaio\". Franco Galli was born in Lombardy, specifically\nin a small town called Carpenedolo. And he dedicated his entire life to making bread.\nAnd the truth is that this is noticeable because their recipes They are magnificent. It is a very aromatic and tasty bread, it goes\nlove. Its crust is thin and crunchy. And the best\nis that it's done pretty fast thanks to that part of the flour is introduced with\nbiga of Franco Galli. The one that I teach you to do in his time. Those who do not yet know that\nIt is biga not worry. Above the screen, On the right, there is the link. I will also leave\nthe link below the video, in the description. To prepare the phylatins you will need\nthe next ingredients: 375 g of strength flour (11.5 - 13% protein)\n255 g of water 5 g of fresh yeast or 1.7 g of dry\n9 g of salt 135 g of Franco Galli biga Force flour is flour suitable for making\nbread. Maybe in your country you call another shape. Buy a wheat flour that contains\n11.5 - 13% of proteins. This information you'll find in the flour package. In a container put the yeast. Add 125 g of warm water. On this occasion I used the yeast\ndry because it's the one I had at home but you can use the fresh one The quantities are indicated\nin the ingredients. Let the yeast soak for about\n15 minutes. Take the biga from the fridge. Look what body you have! As much as I remove it, it resists to go down The aroma that it gives off is wonderful. This will leave the yeast soaked. In a container made yeast. Add the remaining cold water. Sift the flour. Add the salt. Add the biga. Remove until you see the particles of\nflour. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 20 minutes, so they get properly moistened the flour particles. Pour the dough on the table clean and dry. Knead dough until smooth, shiny\nand covered with small blisters. I have been slow to knead the dough 15 minutes. your\nyou can take more time or less, according to the skill you have and according to the quality\nof your flour. You can knead the dough in the mixer. 5 min\nin first speed, then rest of 20 min and 10 - 12 min at second speed. Spread the container with oil, preferably\nwith the olive Put the dough inside. Close the container and leave the dough at rest\nabout 30 minutes or until it has swollen slightly. Fold the dough into an envelope. Close the container and let the dough rise\nin 1.5 times. That swells but not much. At 22\u00baC my mass took 40 minutes to rise. TO\nHigher temperature will rise before and vice versa. Sprinkle the table with flour. Roll the dough over the sprinkled table. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of the same weight.\nOf about 190 - 200 g. Fold each piece in the form of an envelope. Cover them with a cloth and leave them at rest\n15 minutes. Grab a piece of linen or cotton cloth\nchubby, and sprinkle with flour. At the bottom of the oven put a tray for\nthrowing the water. Put the stone to bake breads and pizzas. Turn on the oven at 250\u00baC with heat only\ndown. Take a piece of dough. Form the sfilatino as I show it. The length of the bar must be the size\nof your stone or tray on which you are going to to bake. Place it on the fabric with the stitching\nup, supporting it on the sides with folds. It is so that it does not grow in width but at\nhigh. Let them rise. You will know that the bars are ready to bake\nWhen you see that your skin has stretched, you It has become smooth and smooth. At 22 - 23\u00baC my pieces have been slow to rise\n40 minutes. At higher temperature they will rise before and vice versa. Place the bars with the stitching below\non a small board or a piece of covered cardboard with baking paper. Make some cuts. Put them in the oven. In the bottom tray, pour almost a glass of water\nboiling. If you do not have the stone like mine you can bake them\nin a tray. After 5 minutes the temperature drops to 225\u00baC\nand put the heat up and down. Bake the bars for 20 more minutes. Yes\nyou want more bark, bake more time and vice versa. If your oven heats more on one side than\nOn the other hand, when they have taken color turn them or change them from site. Take philately from the oven. Place them on a rack and let them\ncool at least 10 minutes. They serve for accompany all kinds of meals. And also\nto make sandwiches. To keep them free. With these delicious sfilatinos I made impressive\nand unparalleled garlic bread. I will show you do soon. After this garlic bread\nIn your life there will be a before and after.

to lightly dust our surface scrape the dough out onto our surface and so I'm going to shape this dough into two different shapes I'm going to show you how to shape up traditional French baguette and then I'm going to show you how to shape demi baguettes which are smaller about half the size and fit more easily into your oven at home so for the French baguette I'm going to divide the dough into three hundred gram pieces and for the deme baguettes I'm going to use half that way so I'm going to divide it into 150 gram pieces [Music] you can always eyeball this but for me as a baker weight really matters both when you're scaling out your recipe just in terms of consistency and then also when you're dividing so things look more consistent if you find yourself making the same sourdough recipe or the same baguette dough recipe and you've become so comfortable with it that you can just sort of eyeball the weights of things and you know what the dough feels like then by all means you don't need to weigh anything out but for me consistency is really important and so I always weigh everything out from the ingredients to the the scaling of the dough right before I shape it great all right so when I'm dividing now that these are divided I'm going to appreciate them and pre shaping is the step right before shaping and you're pre shaping so that you can get an even and consistent final shape that's all so if you're shaping it into a ball you do really don't need to do a pre shape but when you're shaping it into a long baguette you want that baguette to be even and so you want to do some type of pre shape so that the final shape is even so the first thing I do is I take a breadboard here and you could also use your kitchen counter or just something that you can flower and let the bread sit on it for about 15 to 20 minutes so I'm just going over the board with some flour and now I'm going to take my baguette piece and I'm going to roll it up like I'm making a log and that's all that I'm doing with this pre shape as I'm rolling it up and I'm making a log and that will become my final baguette shape I'm not putting a lot of tension on this although you could but I'm just rolling it out just so it's nice and even now for the demi baguettes my pre shape is around and so I'm going to round this dough and so again I am flowering my hands because this is a little sticky that's okay I'm going to take against the surface that I'm working on instead of round and use that friction to create a nice all and I'm going to work two at a time and then these balls are going to rest along with the baguette oblongs for about 20 minutes and we're letting them rest because we want the gluten to relax and you might find as a beginning baker that your dough is already soft enough or relaxed enough for you to shape it into a baguette and that's great really for a professional Baker who puts a lot of tension in the dough you need to let that gluten relax before you can do the final shape the rolling here for example is really working the gluten and so if I tried to shape this into something else right now I wouldn't be able to so I need to let it relax [Music] so that's dividing and pre shaping baguette toe we're going to let this relax and we'll come back to it in about 20 minutes so I'm going to show you how to shape a baguette and then I'm going to show you how to shape Demi baguettes so I've moved all of my pieces of dough onto my board so I would have some more space but you don't necessarily need to I've got myself set up so I've got a row of flour right in front of me I've got my workspace where I'm going to shape my baguette I've got my bench knife which is really important in shaping and then I've got what is called a Koosh which is a French word it's a verb it means coucher which means to sleep and basically I've rolled this couch up and I'm going to proof my baguette on this couch and it's just going to sort of let my bread proof and rest and it sort of helps support my bread so it doesn't go slack when it's proofing so I've got my couch set up right over here on a board this couch is about 26 inches long you could easily substitute this is a linen kitchen towel and it's somewhat sturdy and this is an easy easy substitute if you aren't able to find the linen available so I'm going to start shaping my baguette dough and the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to deflate it just a little bit with a little smack you don't have to really deflate it because we did knead it by hand and then I'm going to take a piece of my dough and I'm going to fold it over itself like I'm making a letter fold only this time I'm going to use my thumb in my hand and I'm going to push the dough forward sort of like you're pushing forward parallel to your work surface and that is going to create this little bit of tension like this and then from that point forward I'm going to roll and seal with the palm of my right hand and I'm going to roll see I'm rolling it and I'm sealing it I'm going to go back over it and I'm going to do it one more time and see that has formed a seam on the bottom and so at this point I have my initial shape I'm going to roll my baguette out I'm going to flour on my hands a little bit so it doesn't stick to me and just start in the center and I'm going to work in the center and I'm going to work my way out so start in the center and then work your way out like that and so that is a shaped baguette I'm going to put a little flour down on my couch so the baguette doesn't stick to it I'm going to make sure that the seam is on the bottom of the couch and then I'm just going to fold the couch up just a little bit like that and now I have a spot for my next baguette and so this next baguette I'm going to shape faster so you can see what it looks like in sort of like real time so deflate fold over and out and then seal and then roll it out and the rolling out is really helping to even it out too and then you're going to just put it in the flour put it on the couch and then fold the couch up and now to shape the deme baguettes these are rounds and so the way I shape these is first I deflate it a little bit then I make a letter fold like this and then I'm going to bring the two top ends of my rectangle down to the center to form a triangle and then I'm going to take the top of that triangle down and now I'm going to just sort of roll it out and as I roll it out I'm going to taper the ends and then I'm going to dip it in the flour and then I'm going to make sure that I dust this a little bit I'm going to put my dummy baguettes right here and deme baguettes are a great way when you don't have a lot of space in your home bread oven if the baguette isn't going to fit like these will be a tight fit in this bread oven but you can easily fit multiple demi baguettes in your bread oven so I'm going to do a letter fold then I'm going to bring the two top corners down to make a triangle I'm going to take the top down all the way to the bottom and then I'm going to roll it out and I'm going to taper the ends and bring my Koosh up a little bit I'm going to keep going okay this is the last time you baguette I'm going to quickly shape it I'm going to put it on the flowered couch and then what I like to do sometimes if I have a little extra fabric is I like to sort of pull the fabric over the bread to sort of keep it from drying out and prevent a skin from forming on it so we're going to let this dough proof for about 30 to 45 minutes [Music]", "WvIJ52WVcKs": "so welcome today what are we doing we're baking a baguette why i have no idea but i made this sub goal on twitch so now i'm here in my kitchen not knowing how to cook at all i'm just gonna follow the recipe of that thing and i don't even know i mean i kind of know how it works exactly how i don't know and why am i wearing this it's just because i can put i can put the phone here so you can hear me properly still so i'm just going to turn that thing on and you're going to see the recipe in french very good professional that's the thing i'm gonna be using they're not paying me to do anything okay i'm gonna turn it on okay you know what the first thing you need to do when you cook is wash your hands so let's click start i need to get rid of that okay the first thing i need to put is water so let's put water i already messed up i already put water all around the thing okay 30 more grams yes i did it 15 grams of the thing that is in the fridge how much is this 42 grams 42 so 42 divided 21. so it's a bit less than half of it should be fine right all right so we put it in that we're good and now uh i don't know how it's called but we put farina how do you call it in english i have no idea flower a fl floor floor flower but how the [ __ ] do you say it flower flower so you say like flower like the flower like the thing on the floor more and more and more more almost almost there almost there um whoa we did it and now i go back there i click next oh [ __ ] salt okay okay now we put the thing now we wait seven minutes look at this thing it's [ __ ] shaking what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is it doing it's shaking more and more what the heck calm down my guy okay bud oh my god [Music] so now i have no idea how you do that i'm pretending i know like i'm pretending i'm a professional but i have no [ __ ] clue how people do that okay now i get that thing now you just simply put it there oh oh i forgot that it's a bit like like in here you know you know what [ __ ] off i'm gonna take it with my hands at some point anyways oh [ __ ] ah that was a bad idea should have put flour on my [ __ ] hands before tank again taking it okay so now i just like that i put it all together that's what it says i'm reading the thing and that's what it says okay now i put it in a thing like that oh [ __ ] okay what the [ __ ] now we need to wait one to two hours are you kidding me [Music] okay so we take dad it's huge okay so i need to put all of it just there [Music] my mom is judging me recording me okay uh i just did exactly what it was not meant to do okay now i need to make it into four same stuff don't just take a knife well i guess so [Music] that's four kind of uh kind of same part okay now okay now i need to apparently go like that don't know why but apparently that's what you need to do okay now it needs to be get [ __ ] what am i doing i have no idea what i'm doing mine looks like absolutely nothing she's just sliding not even rolling okay we're almost good we need to wait two more hours so apparently we need to wait two more hours according to the recipes that's a bit annoying i don't really feel like waiting two more hours not gonna lie all right all right and now we do the tours [Laughter] and there we go i think i think we're good okay now let's follow what they say after wait two hours that's annoying [Music] i'm tired i wanna sleep i would not be doing this job that's for sure never are you ready three two one oh what the [ __ ] they actually look almost edible which is surprising for something made by me okay so i need to cut them off a bit in the middle apparently here apparently i take a knife so i cut this here oh no no no no apparently according to the recipe i need to just take it again to do the same thing and to put it in the same uh the same pattern what the [ __ ] why do i okay i'm gonna follow what it says i'm following the recipe okay don't judge me i'm filling the recipe so i have to do that i do the same thing as i did earlier no no we don't have to wait two hours again i checked i checked we don't have to do to wait two hours again then i put it back the same way as it was okay i don't put too much because i was putting too much earlier it just seems odd to me that i have to do that but do two of them one way and cook them what the [ __ ] [Laughter] oh my god okay so now one [ __ ] it looks so odd two three and four [ __ ] i was meant to do it slightly left slightly right i did not do that at all i just did it in a straight line well it will be straight line okay now apparently i need to put water on them now i'm gonna put it in the furnace for 20 to 25 minutes meanwhile um well i mean it could it could be worse i guess but it could also be better i'm going gonna show you how it looks like so the like the this one looks actually pretty great and those two over there well i mean they look like baguettes i guess they just kind of opened weirdly there except this one this one is really the one that is like bro why do i look like that my guy find the one that does not belong here i think we all know which one i don't know if you can hear it but there's like they are still doing some sound listen now it's the time for the important test okay i swear that's not fake smoke that's actually the smoke coming out of the thing all right you ready it's not as bad as as i thought it would it tastes good i would give myself on this seven this guy's just casually snacking a baguette at 11 38 p.m sure completely now i need to find some other sub goal okay like subscribe

friends, today I am going to teach you how to make an easy crunchy gluten-free loaf bread and with a quick rising time also without lactose and without eggs. We are going to need 200 milliliters of water so I am weighing it here so that it is as good as Exactly possible but if you spend a little it is not a problem to this we are going to add a little of the flours that we are going to use in the recipe and a little honey can be about a tablespoon we mix well and if you are not subscribed to the channel subscribe it's fast it's easy and activate the bell so that notifications will reach you now we are going to add 7 grams of dry baker's yeast if you don't have dry baker's yeast in the information box I'll leave you the equivalence with fresh yeast , mix very well and let it rest for about 20 minutes in a warm place we weigh our flours 200 grams of cornstarch now I know that many have asked me how they can substitute cornstarch I have been inves tigando so that what I am going to use to substitute does not make the recipes change much a few days ago this girl who runs an Instagram page called the hashimoto diary sent me her photos of the ciabatta breads and very kindly told me that there was replaced the flours and starch with a starch called arrowroot starch, he was telling me that he was replacing the recipes with this starch and that it was very good, I am waiting to be able to buy it without gluten that is an accessible price to be able to try and bring you recipes with A different option, some of you already know arrowroot starch, leave me your opinion in the comments, we will add 50 grams of yucca starch and above here you get the recipe for the ciabatta bread that I mentioned, click on the card and it will take you directly but now stay with me so you can see how this delicious bread is made if you want to know all the tricks keep watching the full video we will add 1 tablespoon of chickpea flour in the information box I leave you the substitutions as always that many ask me, in the information box I leave the substitutions a tablespoon of ground flax if we spend 1 or 2 up to 4 grams nothing happens it is not going to To greatly influence the recipe a few grams of more 7 or 8 grams of the ground psyllium husk and a tablespoon of brown sugar but this is optional, salt to taste we will mix all very well and we already have our mixture to prepare these delicious breads and or I usually make a little more and save it for whenever I want, I add a little water , yeast and that's it, here we are pouring the yeast and water mixture as I said, we can make it save it and when we feel like a bread, we take out the flour we put a little water and yeast and voila, here we add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar this will help the bread grow better and faster the yeast is activated more it grows faster here mixing I see that The dough is still very dry so I add an additional 50 milliliters of water but this does look very dry the dough then I show you how the texture is going to be remember that if you make the recipes I would love to see the results that you share with me your photos and You can do it in any of my social networks that I leave you here, if you do not follow me here I am in all of them and there I show extra content some extra photo behind the scenes and well if you follow me you will see them we continue kneading until we achieve the texture look at how it is The good thing about the psyllium is that it does not stick , the dough is quite wet but it does not stay super stuck to the bowl like this and look at this texture we are going to add 2 tablespoons of olive oil or vegetable oil of choice and we continue to knead until integrating the olive oil rather than kneading is mixing because we are mixing all the ingredients until they are well integrated, look at this point what I do is fold the dough like this when I add the oil the dough becomes a little stickier you see my hands that I have pieces of dough and this is the texture, so look at how the texture is it has to have this texture that sticks a little to the hands but is manageable on the counter or in a baking paper with a little rice flour and we put our dough and we are going to chop it in 2 we try to make them as equal as possible now I am going to teach you the technique we take one of the pieces we smash as you are watching me do and It has to be more or less of this thickness like this and we are going to bend as well as I am showing you a piece and we glue like this and then the other piece and we are going to join like this then we will fold as I am teaching you likewise we glue the ends like this very well then we will do what we wind a roll ends and so do the piquitos coil like I'm showing very carefully because the dough is still very squishy and do a roll and ready ah now if you have if you have baguettera cut this BABES to the paper and we put the baguette to grow but since I did not have it, we are going to do this trick that I am going to teach you next. Ok first trick we place two kitchen towels that have consistency, one here is thicker than the other, the red one thicker than the one above and we are going to make these channels that I am making so it is going to do this that when we place our loaves the loaves do not grow sideways and fall down and become flat because the dough is soft but that the bread is a barrier and the yeast grows upwards so keep that in mind guys we will let it grow for about an hour, an hour and a half in my case where I am , it is very cold now I have resorted to the trick of the oven off you put a pot with boiling water and let the loaves rise there and that's what it took around that time we turn on the oven and while making the cuts of the loaves this will now facilitate the baking of the bread and also but like all ma Gluten-free sas works differently so we will make these cuts while the oven is heating to the temperature that we will bake, so that the bread continues to grow and the cuts open a little and it is more similar to bread with gluten these would be the loafs of the loaves now in the oven we place a tray with water and the tray with which we will cook the loaves after it has reached the oven temperature, we remove the hot tray and place the loaves, sprinkle corn starch if we want and we will bake our loaves as We put in the lower part of the oven we bake 220 degrees heat down for 30 minutes after this time passes we take out the tray and raise it to the middle part and put the heat up and down, lower the temperature to 190 degrees and bake for 20 minutes or even brown and it will be so spectacular look at the spectacular hairs if we follow all the steps we will get a bread this spectacular and you will see how it is inside and this super crunchy crust look at the most spectacular crumb thank you very much for watching the video remember to share see you next time", "RJDAf42mYrk": "[Music] breaking news battle of the barbers read all about it don't miss it it's

"tell us about Natasha what sort of girl was she Natasha was a really good girl as a child she was never any trouble at all she was just funny she was full of laughter full of love she was cheeky she was a bit of a tomboy but she had a girlie moments as well she was a just a lovely lovely she rely on inbuilt sense of what was right as well the law interested her didn't it did as she got older she was she was for the underdogs she like - she things that she saw on the news or in the press would make her really angry if she felt unfair and she had work experience literally I think it was a month before she passed away and it was a human rights law firm Wow that's what she was interested in and politics and just just something she wanted to do something good with her life well she it was when she was pretty young that she developed these severe allergies to quite a range of foods actually was milk eggs avocados sesame seeds quite a frightening thing I think as a parent and also for her when your child has severe allergies I sort of learning to go through life to avoid these things hmm she has an inbuilt radar though there was a week she was he knew from us that there are certain things that she couldn't eat but even as a really young child if somebody offered her a suite that I hadn't seen she wouldn't take it she knew not to and she would then find one of us to say can I have that so she was very aware right from the start sorry away exceptionally so I think anyone who lives as a family with her anyone who has allergies in the family exclusive of forensic I would say and she as a as a young teenager was very aware read labels and trusted labels always and we taught her to do so it seemed the right thing to do and she did that so at the beginning of that that holiday as we said in the introduction there this is this start the best summer ever positive fun yeah life ahead of you long summer days so you're at the airport and and what did she say just say I'm just gonna go and pop off and get something to to eat yes the first flight out of the morning so we didn't have breakfast at home because much too early when we left home we were at terminal 5 and we just popped into pret ammaji as a group three of us quite busy at that time as I said she went to choose a sandwich something to eat choose something to eat basically that she knew she was safe with and she's with her friend Bethany and she came back to me and I was just just a few feet away so daddy I look I found this sandwich it had olives in it and artichokes one of two of the most favorite foods you do every week at home but this is fine for me and Bethany saw it as well I looked at it looked at over said yep that's fine for you absolutely and we bought that sandwich so the issue here is and this is what the inquest was investigating was that there is a loophole in the law there was no labeling on there that said that it would contain anything that somebody might be allergic to so she she wasn't to know and that's that's the problem exactly yes I absolutely there was nothing no mention of allergens whatsoever and nothing looser nothing visible at all to the eye and if I said before I'm somebody who's quite visual and I would spot things like that and certainly Natasha whose life depended on it would see something like that and things escalated quickly for her on the flight she started to get itchy around the throat and I think she took some antihistamine yes so hope that that would make things better and then gradually throughout the journey things progressed pretty quickly and you administered the EpiPen for her I'd miss yes it's for people again who are allergic sevillio do they do travel and take responsibility to having epi pens too in case one fails I have one in my bag downstairs I'm allergic to bee and wasp stings EpiPen okay thank lid then you'll know and indeed many people will know of that epi pens are considered the life-saving device in such a situation I administered an EpiPen to her right thigh which is the the way to do it into the large muscle of the body and believed we believed I think that would be it that would work because it's the backstop your last resort she said daddy it's not working help me I can't breathe get the other one I ran back to the seat quickly I grabbed the second one from a handbag around back and injected it into her thigh within seconds held and countered the required amount of time and she didn't get better just shockingly didn't get better in fact everything rapidly went within minutes deteriorated to a point and how far were you from landing well the flight was at this point just more than halfway through we're about 3540 minutes before landing somewhere around that time so still a few hundred miles from the final final destination it was incredible how the situation unfolded it was like a it felt like a a warzone what happened next was shocking you landed at nice Airport and she was taken to hospital yes and sadly we know the horrible ending to this is that she lost her life you are at home you have no idea what's unfolding in the sky is all happening this man none at all I dropped them off at the airport's said goodbye hug to them all and went back home and I got a call at half past nine just as the plane was preparing to land and had called me and said Toshi's really ill you've got to come out here straightaway I managed to find a flight it was the first day of the first Sunday of the summer holidays so everything was booked and I managed to find a flight from Stansted and I got there it was a six o'clock flight and then I was told I'm sorry but the flights full there's no room for you at which point I burst into tears and the lady managed to get me on that aeroplane but it was delayed for another six hours so I sat in the gate knowing that um I'm not knowing knowing and not knowing knowing how bad it was but not knowing how terribly bad it was there's there's you know as a parent you you just pray and you hope she'll pull through she was strong she she had everything to live for I in my heart she can get through this she can get through this and then I got a call from nad about seven o'clock saying you've got to take up aha you say goodbye turn now I'm going to put the phone by her ear but you've got to do it quickly how do you do that you just do that you don't he doing you don't I don't know how you do it but he gave me the opportunity goodbye I said goodbye to her and and I just collapsed he took the fee said I've got to go now and and that was it and I just I just fell down I can't imagine the catastrophic blow that has on your family you've got a son you've got Alex as well and you're saying that and I know that you nothing work knows with PTSD and both of you finding it incredibly hard to function and you said something I read something that broke my heart I mean the entire thing breaks my heart but you said how could it be that I failed her but you didn't you didn't fail her she was failed by loopholes in the system shortcuts in in the system you also said she didn't die on your watch she died on Pretz watch that's right that's right I mean it's just I think there's only parent with no home that you feel you can't imagine your child's going to die in front of you we don't we don't bury our children it's not the way it should work and she died well it was with me and not you and I think the sense of terrible guilt that was racking me with I was the one that was there with her it wasn't mummy she liked not that I wished it was the other way around but it's just a terrible pang how could it be so I'm her protector I'm her daddy if a parent is anything he is the apparent is a ultimate carer for their child and would die a thousand times with her as she said when her interest and her passion for for justice you are trying to find a way of making a change and doing something good and Natasha's law is something that you are now able to focus on and this is the right at the start of this and you're trying to change the law for her and for others like her what are you hoping to change well in the year following Natasha's death I was really aware in the press of other people dying from allergies and there were young people coming down to London for a day in you know all over the country though there are about five allergies literally in one summer of deaths and we it was just shocking that this is just part of our life part of what we hear and what nothing seems to be nothing seems to be done about it and it's really time for society just to take it more seriously allergens there are 14 of them and they are poisonous to allergic people they need to be on packaging if something's prepackaged those allergens have to be on that packaging to save lives and if we can be given a voice to make that happen through what happened to our daughter we have to do that you", "DlM0AdL6Spk": "cutting a baguette is an art but if you know the rules the art becomes quite easy to do so when you have the baguette in front of you you have to think about an imaginary line that you draw from the top all the way to the bottom and then depending on the amount of scores or cuts that you are going to give they have to be uneven so it's seven five or three you have to start with your first cut on the top of the imaginary line that you started and you you draw the line imaginary or your score and that scoring you divide into three and your second score has to start on the third of your first line and you cross the imaginary line and you make the cut even long as the first one and like this you continue always an overlap of one third of the baguettes and the end of the cutting happens at the bottom of the imaginary line all right now what you have to realize is that I am left-handed okay if you are right-handed you will start the opposite way for that but I have a surprise for you so I will now cut this baguette let's see what this gives now to cut the other ones I have I have a right hand with me so that song that's all hello is one of our bakers and he's from France so van song I invite you to slice the rest of the baguettes to make them perfect okay you are sick knife like this not like that okay we have now the six baguettes - with seven cups - with five cups to eat ricketts we are now going to bake them and afterwards we will see the result [Music] voila so you see the result first of all drawing on a baguette is not such a good idea but what we wanted to show you is the difference between seven five and three cuts so if we summarize think about the imaginary line that you draw on the baguette make sure that you overlap one-third the cuts that you have to cut uneven three five or seven depending on the length of the baguette and as vasa told us it's very important to keep your knife as horizontal as possible so that you get underneath the surface of the baguette so that the shred can break open and not just spread open so do not cut like this make sure the blade is very sharp and then you will get as Vasant showed us a very nice typical French baguette congratulations Vashon thank you", "z13ZA3wpChs": "[Music] what do you want i want a baguette i eat old baguette you get no buckets you are very funny that's too much very fast yeah i can use

"Idx4QJwcPHA": "shaman all right this is where the Vatican rise or proof and then I have my free shape baguette so this is a rectangle or cylinder appreciate that we're going to do we did last week we're going to do again this week and they've been resting for about 15 minutes so every time you handle the dough there's always a rest or relaxation period and that's really really important with the baguette because if we don't let the hell relax between pre shaping and shaping it's going to be very difficult to the longer so that's important if you find when you go to shape your baguette that your elongated it shrinks back or tears or it's incredibly difficult to elongate let it relax more let it relax more so I lift the dough up with my scraper turning it over into the flour bring it towards me so this part of the bench has no flour don't want it shape in Florida tea gas one two three and I pull up once and then I fold down so I have a seam in the center and then my thumb most people it's going to be me it's my left hand I put my left hand in that seam that crease and I pull the dough over my left thumb with the same end so this is one-handed this happens with the same hand there's a tendency to use the other hand as pull it over and you're going to squash the dough when you do that so here you pull it over with the same hand and the other hand comes in very upright use the base of your palm and you press down very gentle as gentle as you can and that's going to preserve the cylindrical nature of the baguette shape the more round it is at every step more round and upright it's going to be at the end the more volume that's going to get so I came down halfway stick my thumb again and that crease you're seen pull it over my thumb with the same hand the other hand comes in to just get that turn just a gentle gentle gentle if your hand is very upright you're actually touching the minimum of the dough that you can your hand is fly you're going to flatten out this top syllable baguette is going to be more flat right third time thumb in that crease right where the seam is this time I'm going to seal the seams so I'm going to be a little bit more aggressive with how I how much force I put downward and that's my cylinder that's the end of the first phase the second phase elongated make it longer cup your hands over the baguette press down as you can expand your hand and that will elongate the baguette check it to see if it's relatively even it's 23 or 24 inches then you're going to turn it over to see that the seam is in the center of the bottom rotate Coosh we should be a little bit taller than you", "WYMXbA2V4nI": "Hey, city dweller. My name is Amanda McLemore. I'm a sustainable food activists from Chicago, USA. And today we're going to teach you how to master the art of creating less food waste. When I was a child, every time I would open the fridge, I would find food that had gone bad. Now over time. I realized there was a couple of tips and tricks I can incorporate into my kitchen in order to create less food waste. And I'm going to share a few of those things with you today. Now, one of the first two things that I always add into my kitchen routine is to have a compost bin and to start a garden. And you could start a garden whether indoors in a small pot or outside on the patio or in a backyard and what this does is it helps you to curb food waste because you can harvest things that you need, as you need them. So think about if you purchase herbs from a grocery store, you'd normally purchase a lot more herbs than you need, you use it once and then you'll throw away the rest of it. So by having that herb in the backyard or on a, in a potting plant, you can just harvest what you need and then you can save the rest in the live plant form which just makes it a lot easier. For composting we all create some form of food waste it's inevitable, but it's so much more sustainable if we keep that food waste in the ground and create this nutritious compost that we can use in our garden again. Storing food properly to prevent less food waste. If you store food properly whether in your fridge or on your countertop, you'll increase the shelf life of that food item. And this helps you out so all your food doesn't start going bad at once. So you can have the extra time to be able to prepare the foods as you need them instead of having all this food going to waste all at once. Now one of the other things I love to do to prevent less food waste is utilising parts of the vegetables that were not really told to eat, so if you think about carrot tops, beet greens, and in the case of the salad we are going to make today, I love using the greens and the stems and also the cauliflower itself. Today I'm going to show you how to use every part of the cauliflower in our chard cauliflower salad recipe with pickled grapes and fresh ricotta. Now before we even start using food waste in recipes, we need to inspect it to make sure that it's actually safe for us to use. Now, I always look for things like leaves that may have gotten brown or soft and squishy. We don't want to use anything like that. Or if there's any mold on the surface, of the cauliflower itself. Now this goes for any vegetables. And always if you don't feel comfortable with cooking with a food waste vegetable, turn it into compost. It is always safer if you use your gut and only use food that you're comfortable with cooking. So the first thing I want to do is cut the leaves of the cauliflower floret. So all I'm gonna do is just slice them off the base and set them aside in a separate bowl. Now we will use these later when we are dressing our salad. Now next, I'm going to cut up the core or the stem of the cauliflower. I like to cut these in about medium-sized pieces so that they all cooked evenly with the cauliflower as well. And for the florets i'll just cut them up individually. I really like the flat sides just because we're going to char these and being able to have that flat side to the cauliflower it makes it really easy to get some nice golden brown colour on the edges. So after that, all we're going to do is places this in a bowl and mix it with some olive oil, salt and pepper. And then we're going to place it on the comal. Ending life in expiring foods now, I know this has happened to a lot of us where we have yogurt or milk and it's at its expiration date or maybe a few days before. And we don't really want to take the risk of having sour cereal So we end up pouring it out and it's tragic because we can make new things out of food that's about to go bad. In the case of today and our salad, we're going to make a simple ricotta, just using a few ingredients that most of us already have in our kitchen. We're going to start with two cups of milk into a sauce pot From there we'll add a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Now, I'll turn the pot up to medium-low heat and allow this to heat up to a 185 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I'll constantly stir this just to make sure that the milk does not burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. Now once we reach a 185 degrees, I'll turn off the pot, let it sit for ten minutes, and then we can strain this into cheese cloth and allow it to drain for about 30 minutes to get all of the whey removed from the ricotta. Now, don't worry, we don't have to throw away the whey either we can use this in other recipes like smoothies, or pasta sauces. You can freeze it if you don't have an immediate use for it. So don't even think about throwing this out either. It's really, really delicious in other recipes. So for two cups of milk, you get about a quarter cup of ricotta cheese. You can use this in any recipe that calls for ricotta. Now, I typically would use it the same day, but you can keep it in the fridge covered for about up to three days. Quick preservation methods to prevent less food waste. Now, I love this one. It's, you know me, I love my little larder and I love canning and preserving. Now there's a couple of quick preservation methods that will help you to curb food waste. One, you can dehydrate foods. Second one, you can freeze foods. And the third one, which we're going to do today with these grapes, are we're going to pickle them. Now, I love pickling fruit because it is kind of unconventional, it's not something that we think of doing, but it works really well with salads or on cheese boards for entertaining or for a stay at home happy hour. To make the pickle brine I add a cup of red wine vinegar, a quarter cup of water, and three-fourths a cup of honey. Now you can use sugar, or maple syrup, whichever sweetener you desire will work perfectly in substitution of honey here. Now after that, i'll add in the spices I like to use chili flakes, mustard seed, cloves, peppercorn and then i'll add an a cinnamon stick, fresh thyme from the garden, you can use dry thyme as well and a little splash of vanilla extract. Now we'll bring this up to a boil and allow all of the honey or sugar to dissolve completely, and just allow the herbs and the spices to steep into the liquid before we pour them over the grapes. Now I take the grapes and I'll stem them and put them in a clean jar. I typically use about a pound grapes for this recipe. And I pour the hot brine over the grapes. Now, I let this cool off completely before storing it in the fridge. And typically before I use it in a recipe, I will let it sit for about a day just to let the pickle brine steep into the fruit itself. And now I'm ready to make our salad. We're going to take the greens that we set aside earlier and place them in a mixing bowl with a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of salt. Now, I'm gonna just massage these greens first just to help them break down and incorporate all of the flavours into the greens better. I do this with all of my brassica salads it just makes for a better end product. Now, I'll take the charred cauliflower florets and stems that we charred earlier, and I'll mix this into the bowl as well with the pickled grapes making sure that when I take the pickled grapes out of the jar that we're not putting any of the peppercorns or mustard seeds into the salad. Now, all we have to do is simply dress this with a little bit of olive oil, a little lemon juice, salt and pepper, and just make sure to give it a good stir. All of these flavours get mixed in really, really well. Now, place this on a nice platter with a garnish of that ricotta cheese that we made earlier. And this salad is ready to go. Now, I love a salad for both entertaining and just for a simple meal at home. It's a really great way to use up foods that may have gone to waste. And I'm super excited to see you make the salad and just be creative in all of the different ways that we can use up food waste and make something beautiful with it. I cannot wait to see what you guys create and we will see you soon.", "xi0AXyinIOk": "boys ooh it's agent yes and yes mission accepted so the baguette started first appearing in Paris in the mid-1800s

guys so please use that link save you some money and help support this channel so in terms of the details this watch is 42 millimeters in diameter so it's gonna be this way okay another thing about this watch that makes it stand out guys it's an automatic movement so what the automatic movement means is there is no battery in this watch so in order to operate this watch you have to wind the watch or you have to wear it okay if you do not wear this watch for a few days it will stop and you will have to reset the time so if you look very closely you can see the movement here you all see that and another thing about this watch is there's no ticking okay with it being automatic it's a sweeping movement look at the close-up here so if you want to see a closer perspective please watch the b-roll footage uh you'll be able to see the hands move sweep all that good stuff you also be able to see the internal components on the front and also in the back side but anyway so getting into the details of this watch here this watch is stainless steel and obviously guys the baguettes are czs okay these are high quality czs um i will be doing an on risk profile also a shine test and down selector test so please stay tuned if you made it this far guys please remember to like share and subscribe to your boy drip guy tv while it's dropping the highest content of the game and i really need your support but anyway so in terms of durability street isd state that this watch is rated up to three atms which is up to 30 meters okay so in terms of it being waterproof yes guys it is waterproof but perfect instruction the street ice did state that they do not recommend you wearing this in the water going to the beach all that good stuff they also recommend it if you sweat in this watch please wipe it off it probably has to do with the setting of the baguettes they did say they could cause corrosion so guys if you want to wear this in the pool you can but just be careful because this watch maker rolled and all that good stuff but your watch is not gonna stop because it is rated up to three atms i think that they're really worried about the band okay also guys shout out to street ice they did send me this watch for free i really do appreciate it i just want to thank them for sending over this piece for me but anyway so in terms of warranty this watch also comes with a six month warranty when you receive it through the mail it's gonna come with the authenticity card so please make sure that you keep your authenticity card if anything happens with this piece a cz falls out or something like that please make sure that you keep your authenticity card reach out to street ice and then we'll get everything taken care of for you so what i'm going to do now let me go ahead and give you guys a wrist profile of the street ice ice spaghett watch so guys this is the risk profile of the street ice ice baguette watch as you can see the baguettes are hitting okay i will be doing a shine test in a second one thing i can tell you about this watch is it is a little big another thing with street ice is that guys these watches do not come with the link remover okay so in terms of sizing you do have to go to the mall or go to a watch location to get your watch size but it's not a big deal to me uh street ice we've had conversations about it they stated that they may start including a link remover and some of their pieces here but in terms of the wrist profile it is a very nice weight to it it's a very nice look i really like the skeleton look if you watch my b-roll footage if you take this watch off you can actually see the inside of the skeleton as well in here okay so what i'm gonna do now let me go ahead and turn the lights off so we can do an official shining test whoa guys this is the official shine test of the straight ice ice baguette watch guys this watch is hidden from every single angle if you guys can see the skeleton face there oh man it's definitely a nice look uh this watch really looks premium okay so with baguettes the czs are longer than a rectangular shape so it is going to have a little different look but guys it is shining it is hitting it does feel like a premium watch here look at that okay y'all see that sweeping movement if you're interested in purchasing this watch right here please use my link pin in the comments guys like i said before the retail price on this watch is 427 but using my link pin in the comments right now you can get this watch for 304 dollars guys check it out so what i'm gonna do now let me go ahead and get on my diamond selector and see if it will pass the diamond selector test so guys i have my down selector set before let's go ahead and see if it passes okay is jumping up one level [Music] jumping at one level again let's try these czs by the bezel jumping up one level again let's bump it up to five let's see if it passes now [Music] just jumping at one level let's try it one more time so just to give you my final assessment on this piece here i do think it's a great buy especially using my link you can get this watch for 304 dollars a couple of things i want to touch on though so in terms of the instructions when i received the instructions for the watch the instructions were for the right watch but it did not go over how to wind your watch or anything like that because guys this is automatic watch it does not have batteries or anything like that so in most cases you have to wind it or wear it just for the watch to work i wish the instructions touched on that a little bit and another thing i want to say about this watch is it did not come with the link remover okay so i touched on this on my last street eyes video uh we've been in conversations and things like that and they did state that they will be looking into putting in link removers into the watch because guys i can't even wear this watch now because it's so big so i would have to go to the mall or go to a watch location in order to get the links removed in order for the watch to fit but other than that this watch shines hard um there's no ticking um i just think it's a great quality watch a great build especially for the price and you can't beat it man street ice they're out of sweden um you know don't let that deter you the shipping was only three to five business days so it's very very

influential people on both sides of the law welcome to the channel guys my name is alex and this is karar today we're going to take a closer look of this extremely beautiful watch it's the rolex day-date 40 in yellow gold with the baguette cut diamond indexes lovely so alex let me ask you this fire away how do you like this piece i love it i'm a man of golden diamond so uh this one is right down my alley yeah and i know you are super excited to have this one with us today absolutely i'm actually super excited about um getting familiar with the day-date 40. i don't get to hold many of these and obviously the day-date has a long and um very interesting history insurance and and the rolex watchmaking so can you run us through when was this introduced and briefly about history let's keep it brief um it was introduced back in 1956 so we're talking 65 years now of the rolex day-date and throughout these 65 years this model has been available in many many many different versions different references in different dial combinations sizes etc um the predecessor of the day-date 40 was the day-date 41 that was introduced back in 2008 and uh thankfully rolex discontinued that one after a couple of years and in 2015 the date 840 made its entrance and that's what we have right here exactly and to talk about the older version of the 48-41 yeah i actually agree with you i think that watch was a little bit out of proportion and slightly too big for a gold watch that is supposed to be dressy and be able to wear with a suit etc but this model right here i think they did everything right here yeah except size because i like the 36 and in my opinion the classic day-date should always be 36. however for the guys that loves a little bit more wrist presence yeah we see this throughout many of the rolex model lines such as the datejust and so on um that they have various different sizes available so the day date is currently available in 36 and 40. if we look at this specific model the the parts that really sticks out to me is the the case we need to talk about the case i mean if you look from profile on the case it is slightly on the bigger size and it comes in at around 12 millimeters and for a dress watch you probably want it below 10 millimeters but still wears pretty i mean thin on the wrist and it will slide under a cuff easily and so on absolutely it's not a thick watch per se absolutely and i think the case profile per se helps its size a lot it have slimmed down lugs it's not like the maxi case um it is beautifully shaped just like an oyster look at that yeah i it's it's a really beautiful watch don't get me wrong [Music] and i mean the fluted bezel the polished case the bracelet will get more into the bracelet soon but how everything plays in lights and how it shines i mean this is a watch that will get you a lot of attention all right alex so let's talk a little bit about the bracelet i mean look at this gorgeous bracelet so what do we have we have satin finished outer links with polished center links and as you can see it holds beautifully and with the latest rolex day-date models they have also introduced a ceramic coating pins so you don't get the stretch that you do on all the models exactly and the older models if you remember if you if you hold them like this they could bend like this and that's a nice nice upgrade finally exactly and the this is absolutely amazing the the bracelet is finished to perfection and integrates really lovely with the case and the clasp the hidden crown clasp what a beauty when you close it up like this it all looks like one solid piece yeah in my opinion this is the best rolex bracelet ever made period and for me also the rolex day-date is probably my favorite model from rolex ever and i mean when you when you have this piece in hand and you see the finish the the shine between the brushed and polished surfaces and we haven't even come to the dial yet with these amazing baguettes i mean this watch is a state-of-the-art piece from rolex yeah and let's talk a little bit about the dial so usually roman numerals are very common on day dates this piece doesn't have those it has baguette cut diamonds and both me and alex are huge fans of diamonds on watches if they are done in the right way and i think this is done in the perfect way yeah how do you like it um what's not to like i mean the when you see these shots of the close-ups and the diamonds and how they're raised a bit about above the dial and how they contrast the champagne somber style i mean it's just wow that's amazing yeah let's insert a close-up and let's show people look at that look at it right kyra i know you're dying to get this watch on your wrist so let us hear your thoughts when you put this beauty on let's have a closer look wow obviously not size to my wrist right now but let's just look at how the bracelet sits from the clasp all the way to the actual dial wow is it love at first sight yes it is and the size how do you feel because we have 16.5 centimeter wrist yes i actually really like the size i think the size is perfect uh i wouldn't mind if it was slightly smaller but i think this is um this is very good as well um and yes the diamonds when you have it on your wrist how the diamonds pop differently depending on where the light comes from it's just mesmerizing to look at that dial i mean i don't know if i would look down to actually look at time i don't know if i'd catch the time you'd have to check a couple of times yeah actually the first check is gonna be a diamond check and then probably i'm gonna be like holy i need to know the time and no this is absolutely amazing and i think the wrist presence of this piece is yeah it's something else it's really really gorgeous this is a piece with its weight that will give you an extra couple of centimeters on the on the wrist from working out with it absolutely and talking about weights the 40 millimeter datejust in comparison sorry day-date in comparison to all the day dates this is a solid gold not like the older version yeah they had the hollow case and it was it's a bit more uh you know the the feeling when you compare vintage day-date 36 and the new one 36 or 40 the feeling in the clasp and the feeling overall in the like solidness of every part is totally different yeah and this is in the 40 millimeter size it's more of a sporty watch and in this exact configuration with the champagne baguette diamond dial it's my favorite from the current lineup absolutely i would i would like to agree uh the avros with green is close but this one with or thanks to the diamonds actually is my leader and so let's talk a little bit about the current market state of the day dates so last year rolex made a heavy increase in the prices for the day dates so this one um with the normal champagne diet without the baguette diamonds goes for around 42 000 us dollars and if you would like to upgrade it to have it with the diamonds on the dial dial alone will cost you somewhere around six to eight thousand us dollars depending on where you are in the world and your conversion rate so with this constellation i mean we're looking at 48 to 50 000 us dollars for a piece like that hefty hefty indeed all right guys so thank you very much for tuning in to this review would love for you if you

it's really fun to make we're home anyway let's impress our family without bread making skills so for this bread recipe we're gonna use a combination of flowers and that's my recommendation to to you is this whatever we have in our house let's use up we're going to use some all-purpose flour from Janey's we're gonna use some spelt now I'm gonna use some Central milling you can see this big bag over here this sucker see that thing we're gonna use some of that bread flour inside we're going to use a combination of all these ingredients we're gonna somehow get to 500 grams and how we're gonna do that is this way I got grams on there now this is gonna be the majority of our flour we don't have let me go 250 grams of bread flour you can see I'm just kind of making this recipe up which is what I urge you guys to do at home I've got about 260 grams of flour so to call it 250 I'm going to use 200 grams of all-purpose flour so 200 so we get to 450 I'm gonna go to 460 how's that actually go to 465 now I'm gonna go to I went to 475 now I'm going to use some spelt in here as well so now we'll do a 25 grams of spelt we get to 500 okay look at that right on the money boom okay one gram of this baby into here boom twenty grams of salt which some might think it's heavy if you think it's heavy and go a little light goes right in next we're going to do is just whisk my ingredients together some people might say to add the salt last I say add it together keep the steps simple right bread-making should be simple and fun now for my water water goes right in to my bowl and before I pour out of the bowl I like to kind of get it somewhat incorporated right and what I'm going to do this this bread requires a few different steps so my first one is to combine all the ingredients together okay and then what I'll do is i'ma let it rest for about 20 minutes they call that like resting it auto Elise okay and so i'ma do is press my ingredients together and all I'm doing is combining the flour and the water and the salt together I do this by hand so I and I love the feel the dough it feels nice but I do this also so I'll get a like dry clumps of flour in the and the bread which is uncomfortable when they bake it dough balls are stretching your dough out press it out so my feeling is if you've got 12 hours that's great if you can do 24 even better 48 even better got my massive dough here let's put it back into my bowl I'm gonna cover this up let it just rest for maybe 20 minutes to a half an hour and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna fold this dough we're gonna fold this several times like three or four times and what that's gonna do is allow all the gluten network to kind of really work together and form a nice beautiful complex structure of this bread versus just kind of letting it sit there so we have put a little work into this one gonna be awesome before we do anything when working with dough if you don't want it to stick water your hands get a little wet you'll make this dough a little bit more manageable to sticking so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna break this out I'd like to use a little semolina flour it's like a durum wheat as my flour just to help this thing on not stick and we're going to do essentially take this dough I'm just gonna fold it I'm gonna fold it like almost like an envelope and fold it a couple of ways this way that way this way and then that way I'm gonna do this every 20 minutes I'm gonna do it three times three times I'm gonna let this rest you know tight right I'll put a timer on 20 minutes you can see we'll continue doing this three fold three times to really strengthen that gluten then we're gonna put the rest in the refrigerator overnight get a book unshakable Tony Robbins my boy change the glasses these don't these don't on 20 minutes yet No what else is going on today huh making bread all right we're there see that now that's 20 minutes we can wet our hands again a little more semolina flour okay I'll follow that same strategy it's gonna fold over and pinch I fold and pinch again stretch it over stretch and fold when I let this rest 20 minutes again covered all right 20 minute timer and what that'll do is we'd do one more fold this is round two one more to go then we're gonna do a cold friend overnight all right so we get our last fold coming up so what we're gonna do same thing round number three all right so what we need to do is just take this up I like to scrape underneath it again okay and I'm gonna fold so we're gonna kind of pull a little bit and fold pinched sticks okay pull pull kind of pinch it in there same on this side and then this side and now we're gonna do we're gonna put this back into our bowl just like this boom I'm gonna put this in the fridge overnight or let it proof just keep it up room temperature put it in the fridge the idea is to let this thing kind of expand now work its magic and the fermentation will make our bread the very next day so we're gonna grab our um dough out of the fridge and we're gonna shape this into like a rectangle aster otic I like to use a little bit of heart disease okay and I'm gonna put some semolina flour down on my parchment we're gonna shape this dough into a rectangle gonna do my best to get this into some type of rectangles be a little tricky because of um I just took it out of the bowl but that's okay look at time nope no rush here coat both sides really getting stuck on me it's okay how do I stop that that's okay watch this so now place it up this way and that way let this proof for a few hours then we're going to slice it slice it okay into fourths I'm gonna make these long strata breads like like you see in the movies so you've got a rectangle now I kind of like the weird shape let this proof for a few hours and we'll be good to go make it out so I might even throw a little more semolina flour on top just cuz I think it has a really great texture it grab out a cutter I'm gonna literally cut this into like fourths and I do boom I don't even want to be perfectly honest I like it like this and now I've got my my four slices panel goes on okay so gonna be careful these things are longer than my paddle so open the oven up using two hands essentially there you go boy and now we're gonna put our time on for about maybe ten minutes we'll take a look I'm gonna take these out of the oven per second and work some other magic so I'm gonna break these apart carefully because they're hot you're gonna be careful hot now I'm gonna do is I take these bracelets these baking steel bracelets and can see our logo on them they're awesome I'm gonna put place these oops I dropped one place these on the steel all right I got eight of them somebody used eight of these four four of these uh these gonna act like it'll elevate that bread just a little bit off the steel so I won't burn the bottoms of the bread however it's gonna allow these things watch one at a time cook underneath so I can get this thing it's a nice color a nice crisp we can finish our bake you see that and we'll get a nice crispy crust these things will cook and about probably like six or seven more minutes time it and we'll check them out I got the bread elevated off the steels now you're getting all that airflow underneath and really crisp these things up beautifully [Music]", "QF8-_-9ikgk": "[Music] all right so welcome back to another episode of fast casual nation the podcast and of course as you know we talk about all things innovative and groundbreaking in the fast casual segment right here on this show and today we're going to be exploring the bakery cafe segment and the idea I mean this is one of the cornerstones of fast casual when you look at some of the Titans that kind of cut their teeth on fast casual from Panera all the way back to oven pan these are companies that have been exploding over the past decade to 15 years and what's unique is we have seen some new entrants really starting to take a solid position in the space and one of those is Paris baguette and with me today I've got CEO Jack Moran great to have you jack Paul my pleasure to be here yeah so Jack you when you look at your resume you've been in the bakery cafe business for a while you were over at Lipan go to Dean and now with Paris baguette you you seem to love this space what's kind of connecting you to it so 17 years in the bakery cafe space the interesting thing Paul is I come from casual themed dining I started working with a guy named Isaac Tigerettes who he and his partner Peter Morton founded a concept called the Hard Rock Cafe yeah Isaac opened the first one in the u.s. in New York City I went to work for him and over time I worked for the Hard Rock in the Northeast US and then in Canada and then in 1999 they moved me to Europe to run the business Yoruban and they move me to Paris France while great pleasure in Paris selling burgers and beer and t-shirts I became a bakery aficionado and over four years of living in France I really became a connoisseur of baked goods of baguettes of croissants of good espresso and I decided to change segments I thought huge opportunity for growth in the bakery cafe segment I left Hard Rock Cafe after 16 years of international employment and I went to work for Obama Penn the one that you just mentioned okay yeah they had just been bought by Compass Group in 2003 and they were looking to move to a self-serve model I moved to New York to help them do that I became frustrated at old pal because they for the life of them could never make a good croissant and no matter how we tried and my personal pride got involved at a certain point and I wished there was a plate in the u.s. like the place I used to go to in Paris which was called Lippincott idea so I googled them in 2005 not knowing that they were a chain and I wrote them a letter and I went to work for them and worked for them for 13 years and ended up being CEO and right and now I've migrated over to and even for me more premium player which is Paris baguette and I've been here for almost a couple of years yeah I must say you know I've been a big fan of Paris baguette for quite some time when I got a chance to really take a look at this brand a few years ago I was impressed by the quality much like what you just mentioned is there something when you look at quality because now I'm you're essentially one of the experts in the field of bakery cafe when you look at quality do you feel that that is translating down to the consumer today do you feel like they realize what's really happening in the space I don't think the consumer knows that they know quality but they do and I think Starbucks has has lowered the bar let's say for a lot of people as to what Hassan is or could be I think Panera is sort of out of the baked goods game Pratham oj was in the bakers game for a while but they quit obon pan got bought by Panera which got bought by Jay a B and and there's just a lot of movement in that segment so I think the consumer has forgotten what they knew was good and when we put something that's good in front of them and fresh and well-made it's a real Wow and they yeah moment they snap back to oh my god I forgot that it could taste like that almost like when you go to Europe and you read a strawberry or a tomato and you realize that they can actually have flavor because in the u.s. they're just big they're just big and available all year round so yes I think the consumer really does appreciate quality and when we put it in front of them they show their affinity and their loyalty yeah absolutely well it's it's interesting you say that about the consumer because we are seeing some trends here in the space where the artists artisanal brands are the ones that are really starting to break out whether you look at pizza burger bakery cafe fresh Mex really doesn't matter there's usually one company or two that start to break out in that and artisanal way that kind of set themselves apart as really the market leader so it's interesting to see that you guys are on that track and I definitely like the fact that that you're focused there in in your history of working in the fast casual segments if you look back on your career and say hmm you know we were there in the very beginning with all bob pan and kind of the breakout years of where fast-casual started becoming recognized as an upscale product for limited service were there any things that you saw back then say 15 years ago that could help you identify future trends today anything you saw and maybe computing a consumer behavior product quality things of that nature in your experience Paul you know what I remember I remember when Lehman Brothers went belly-up and then the entire economy went sideways the Great Recession I think is what we now call it 2008 and and we were very concerned I had I was with lpq the banquet idea and at that moment we were a premium bakery and we thought as the financial situation started to collapse that people would stop spending at our level and they would trade down and what we saw was in fact the dining custom or the very high high-end consumer started shifting down to opq yeah and we didn't lose any market share at all in fact we picked up markets there so again you and I know right now we're in almost 12 years of the growth cycle everything I know tells me that at some point it's going to end I don't think it's going to end during the election year I think everything will be done that's possible to keep that from happening but at a certain point parts of the industry parts of the economy are fat it's always healthy to have a decline and a shake down and I think we may see us counter-intuitively during the next shakedown that of some of these artists and segments actually do better than we think right and it's the commodities that get hurt when the economy is a little bit soft so I feel if I was investing right now I would make of I would make a couple bets on some of these niche players I think you know the whole thing started let's get out of the bakery segment for a moment I'll go back to my burger days the better burger segment having a better cut of beef cooking it live having a better bun a better ambiance that whole thing has really turned into quite a phenomenon and it's and it's been great for the consumer I think seeing that applied to other segments like pizza like salad like bakery right time that that happens yeah absolutely I think you're dead on because the trends are showing that in our research with lootable labs we follow really kind of the the top 150 currently and what we could classify as emerging brands Paris baguette being one of them and something that we have noticed in the past three years is a very interesting trend around the multi-unit concepts that are more chain driven where transaction numbers are starting to slide these are solid fast casuals companies like Panera Bread Firehouse Subs you name it the guys that have been leaders for quite a while and we have seen transactions started to shift and move toward this artisanal segment or the high-end players better quality a little bit more expensive but not exorbitantly and actual increase in those top 25 brands out of that 150 which if we look at that list it is 100% under 300 units mostly artisanal and and usually top of their class in the segment so I think you're dead-on with what's happening there for sure so Jack when you look at Paris baguette you guys of course are a franchise system you've got about 80 units plus franchise corporate what's the mix right now are you are you really focusing on more corporate openings or as franchise kind of a destiny for you guys where we're bifurcating a little bit Paul we we had out we started out in the u.s. in California we had about 45 locations on the west coast we owned the majority of them and and this year we've started what we call reap franchising we've taken about 10 15 I think I'm in the process with about 15 and we're selling those company owned businesses back to existing franchising ok getting out of that game a little bit but on the other end in Manhattan I had three franchisees I shut them down we've taken the whole market back company own and we just opened the eighth company on Paris baguettes in Manhattan so where we're going in two different directions I think we want to own New York City and then I think for the rest of the US and maybe North America we would like the frat guys and maybe at some point maybe be 10 15 % company owned in the restaurant that's that's a good mix and so is it has it been tough going or tough sledding to get to a group of franchisees that can kind of uphold the quality level that Paris baguette represents so interestingly if I go backward for a minute we we started out in LA selling one franchise to one mom-and-pop and then a second to embalming pop sort of the subway model if you will right right and we were not well-known enough and didn't have good enough unit economics that we could attract some of the serious multi-unit players we've worked diligently on our unit economics and as you as you know as you start to grow the first thing that happens is you can start to leverage your suppliers right you start to grow you start to give them volume in exchange for volume they give you price as you create a growth narrative now you can go back to them and say I'm gonna grow exponentially and I'd like you to be my partner what can you give me in exchange for even more growth so we've we've watched without hurting our quality which watched some some unit economics improve as a result of better pricing that's allowed us to bring in and attract some multi unit players I think as we migrate into twenty twenty twenty five and then one twenty twenty two will be working with far more significant players and we are attempting to avoid except in the extraordinary circumstance doing one offs anymore we're going to be doing area development agreements and and maybe even in in like say Mexico I might license all of Mexico City to one developer interesting very cool well I think that that's a you know it's a strategy that I've seen work in a variety of brands where they really get because you get a lot of buy-in there's a lot of investment dollars so it's kind of a you just can't fail type approach they're that dedicated to you know the brand which is what you need when you have a real high quality product that has to really maintain a level of performance for customer acceptance so you guys of course are showing showing up heavily on the rewards program and online ordering a matter of fact it's kind of your poster children on your website how is that going for you guys well we I would say I have mixed results we launched the the app just about a year ago and and it has been growing wildly online ordering the app looks good until I had a technology snack and we are a Korean brand counter-intuitively with the name like Paris baguette we can talk about that at some point and we were using all proprietary Korean point-of-sale system and the Korean technology does not integrate well with the American order online and pickup technology gotcha so my capital plan for 2020 was to come up with an investment amount to convert all the US locations to a new point of sale and I was awarded that capital and now I'm in the process of doing that and I think all of that will be fairly well integrated by the end of 2020 and then we can move forward a little more aggressively yeah so online ordering we've seen third-party you know ordering and delivery really kind of position in the industry for the past few years last year was the first time that we saw transaction decline in third-party delivery companies and this has included the likes of GrubHub ubereats etc what is your take as a CEO when you're out there prepping for growth just like what we've discussed here do you feel that third-party ordering is going to sustain throughout the next few years so Oh super question and we've struggled with this a lot do we put that delivery entrance to the side and interrupt customer flow do we build a big order online and pickup section like a lot of the players are doing now should we do both our bet at the moment again it's coming back to the economic cycle we believe that there has been a lot of private equity investment in these third-party services it's been a gold rush to grab market share there has not been a lot of focus on profitability I think the PE firms are now starting to come a little impatient but they they're holding on but as soon as that economy becomes soft I think of you stick down I think the consolidation I think we'll find less third parties participating they will have to make money in order to do that they're gonna have to raise their fees yeah consequence of that will be that me as a consumer your restaurants only a block away and I was going to have it delivered but for the price I have to pay you know what I think I'll just water off the line and pick it up myself so yeah we're betting a little more heavily on order online and pick up then we are on delivery and again it sort of depends on your market in Manhattan I think people are gonna be willing to walk for more fast-paced suburban area that maybe livery will work but it's not gonna be cheap yeah absolutely well that is definitely the trend we're seeing it's gonna be interesting to see how this plays out especially in the future because obviously the logistics aspect and the consumer data that's available in these systems or potentially somehow migrating or linking them to these online ordering systems could be you know a treasure trove for the future of fast cattle especially operators that really kind of crack the code like what you guys are doing with a new POS system I think that's going to be a very interesting play good luck to what you're doing there let's talk about you know let's talk about growth in the segment so we we saw a little bit of stagnation mainly because of the big brands of a pan Panera Bread the likes of even chains like Atlanta bread what are you seeing in terms of growth for these artists and bakery concepts like yourself that are starting to break out in the next five years so I think I'm gonna include corner bakery in my conversation too okay I think Oh boom pan Panera corner bakery I can't speak about Atlanta bread I don't know them as well but I went to a corner bakery recently in Denver and it was mainly soup salad sandwich delivery evening I've been in Panera its catering soups sandwich delivery oh bomb pen was starting to go down that path so what we believe is that the bakery segment has been abandoned and that when I read I think Nation's Restaurant news at the end of every year or the beginning of every year has like the Hot 200 and and then they break that down into segments I went to pizza I understood it I went to burger I understood it I went to chicken got it salad got it went to bakery cafe I thought it's all over the place right I don't even understand who's here this isn't it's an empty category with a bunch of players who used to be involved in that segment and they're doing something really different so we think for a baker who's willing to bake on-site in every location which is what we do on-site every day if you're willing to do that and you can reawaken for the customer what that quality was that they forgot no they will come and there's a white space because yeah remember when I forget who it was a Starbucks bought a bakery concept oblongs yep in San Francisco because Starbucks was going to go back into the viennois Zuri business penile stroke lalala song they were heating them to order they had a big initiative about that and they're right back where they were five years ago it is there they don't care about their their coffee people and yeah that's where that's where they execute really well and we're not coffee people we we try to have a good coffee but we're a bakery a bakery a bakery and I think for us and anyone else who wants to take the time to bake well there's an open space and I understand why Panera left and wide open pan left and what corner Baker because it's really labor-intensive and it's super expensive yeah yeah absolutely I got a chance to work on some projects with boudin SF which i think is another one of those artists and little bakeries that just do a great job there in San Francisco and I was impressed with their operations and I you know much like what you guys are doing in your stores is is really going all out in in terms of the art and the craft of great baked goods so I think that's going to be the magic there in terms of the architecture or I should say the infrastructure of Paris baguette how are you guys set up in terms of your owners your kind of your executive team what's what's the team look like they're at Paris baguette today let's go back let's go to owners first it's very interesting so there was a guy in North Korea in 1945 who opened a bakery he started baking bread and he invented an anthracite tunnel oven and he was able to make lots of loaves of bread at the same time maybe even up to a hundred and that was unheard of at the time and then there was a war in Korea and he had to move his bakery from North Korea to South and after the war the population was famished and impoverished and the government gave stimulus to people who could feed the population so he got a little help from the government to grow and he turned into a big mass producer of dough and bread he handed the business to his son and his son in 1988 decided to develop a bakery concept in Korea called Paris baguette and there's now we talked about me having a tea in the US there's almost 4000 of these worldwide there there's a couple in Paris where in Singapore Vietnam where in China and we're in South Korea and since 1945 to the present the company has stayed in the hands of that family and and the good thing for me having worked in different domains in this industry there's no private equity company behind this trying to flip the concept in five years there's no exit strategy the family has no desire to get out all they want to do is expand and enhance the asset so from an ownership point of view we are a 100% family-owned company that's great we have been and there is only the desire to do what we do well now I'll just quickly go back to the guy who founded the company in 1945 he handed the business to his son who invented Paris baguette that son is now the chairman of the company he's 72 years old lives in Korea his name is her jung-in and I was with him this summer in July for five days we toured a lot of locations here it was fascinating Paul we never looked at a P&L we never pulled up a spreadsheet we don't we don't look at any numbers we so it's all about predict we shredded croissants loaves of bread baguettes and in the end I thought okay why don't wins where's the punchline when we start to look at the PNL and and I asked him I said aren't we gonna look any numbers and he said why do we need to he said if the quality is great everything else will take care of itself yeah and I thought that's a little naive but great you know wife ecstatically if you want to believe that and you can it becomes real it becomes so alright that's the that's the ownership part so we're we're in it for the quality and and in the u.s. we we have a team together now where you know we have a finance department and IT department a marketing department and operations department a franchise sales team and at the various other disciplines that one has to run a typical US company we're headquartered right outside of New York City at the moment and we're very slowly moving our offices into midtown Manhattan I think I might get everybody here by 2021 and that's great yeah so and I've got I really believe I have people with me at an executive level of who I worked with a toe bone pen 17 years ago I have with me who I worked with and the banquette EDM when I was the CEO I really feel that I have grabbed some of the best people in the bakery cafe segments in the US and you know and we're we're poised to go after this very cool all right so we're gonna wrap up here I love the the story and definitely a very interesting one I'm not sure everyone knows that story about Paris baguette so that's going to be great for our listeners and and to viewers kind of wrapping up here and when you look at the next five years for especially for a fast casual we we continue to see very significant growth both in brand concept growth we're now tracking over 800 different individual concepts in the US which is just staggering what are your thoughts on this this brand invasion that's happening across all the categories and fast casual can it sustain I reminds me of television we went from black and white to color then we had ABC NBC CBS then there was UHF VHF then there was the the box and you could get maybe five or six channels and then ten and then a package with twenty and then 200 then a thousand then streaming and so I think the days of NBC CBS ABC McDonald's Burger King KFC dominating I think that's over I think the proliferation of brands will only continue to augment I just like is what's happening in media I think though behind the scenes what we'll see Paul eventually is a consolidation in ownership I think what did we just see the other day we saw young brand young yeah yeah yeah so I think the big machine brands don't have the street cred or the street smarts or the innovative skills anymore they're not close enough to create a concept what you're going to do is let the little guys the young ones the the people who are willing to work 20 hours a day seven days a week invent the concepts build them a little bit to a certain point then in an offer capital and they'll offer all the back-office support that these companies need to grow if you look at is a great example LVMH in in in the high-end luxury brands very hidden from public view you and I work in business so we know who they are people don't their name is not on anything but what they're providing and the background to all these companies first thing they do they do payroll they do HR support they do your real estate they do your stove design all you needs to have the brand name and the creative capital to keep the brand asset recycling yeah all the behind-the-scenes stuff gets done so I think answer your question brand proliferation and then when the economy starts to get a little soft there'll be a consolidation on the back end mothership many people what's happening will just be invisible they won't know that Chanel and Louis Vuitton and Bowie annecy are all actually the same company or company yep or sweet green and chopped are owned by the same company you know who knows yeah yeah for sure and I think we are seeing that some brand consolidation and as Warren Buffett would say you know that's the time to buy if we do see a downturn in the market there's gonna be a lot of businesses that will be in a position for either one equity investment or obviously a full takeover it's gonna be interesting because I you know I've been in the space for 20-plus years and really saw kind of the explosion in 2007/8 of kind of the real estate that really opened up at that time for fast casual and kind of set the stage for at that time was about 150 concepts that were really growing and now we're at 800 now a lot of those are you know under five units and they're still in their emerging brand stage just because there's so much peony money out there it's going to be interesting to watch in the next five years and I think you might be dead on the mark there in terms of brand acquisition on the backside especially with young and their recent hit here I would hoard cash right now and just wait and then ready ready to buy right ready to buy alright Jack hey it's been great having you on the show today thanks so much for stopping in well thank you very much yeah absolutely okay so for all of you viewers listeners

"98hweAI3mlg": "[Music] baby squeeze me [Music] baby so what you're going to do first is grab some paper a pencil and draw a rectangle that is 10 inches by 6 inches i just used a rough measurement from a baguette bag that i already had then on one side i sketched out the shape of a baguette bag [Music] [Music] i then folded it in half and cut along the lines i had just made this ensures the bag is symmetrical [Music] then i tidied up the edges you should end up with something like this next you want to sketch the dip at the top of the bag then fold it in half again and cut it out now you have your bag template this is a simple sketch i made to try to explain these steps better so again you draw your rectangle which is 10 inches by six inches then you sketch one side get bag here i've sketched both sides just to give an example of what it should look like when it's cut so then you fold it over and cut out one of the sides to make it symmetrical this is an example of what it would look like fold it over and then you cut where the green bit is which means you should then have something that looks like this where you would then sketch the dip at the top fold it in half and cut it out following that green line [Music] then i stupidly realized i hadn't accounted for seam allowance so i glued my template onto another piece of paper and then cut around it leaving about a centimeter or two around the perimeter and made sure it was symmetrical [Music] [Music] once i had done that i then folded the template in half and measured from the top corner all the way around the edge to the middle point of where i folded this will give half of the measurement needed for the strip of fabric that will be used underneath the bag for me this was about 12 inches then on another piece of paper i drew another rectangle this time 12 inches by 3 inches the 12 inches is going to be the length of the underside of the bag and the three inches is going to be the width of the bag you can change this depending on how wide you want your bag to be i chose three inches i then measured from the bottom corner to the center of the fold this should normally be about half of the previous measurement so this was about six inches with me this bit is slightly more difficult to explain so i then marked the halfway point along this rectangle which was six inches for me and drew a line straight up which would be a three inch line because that's the width then at one end of the rectangle i measured out a one inch gap which is usually the width of a normal zip and then connected the lines from the halfway point going in towards the one inch line at the top then i cut around leaving about a centimeter or two seam allowance around the edge [Music] this is now your template for half of the bottom of the bag if that makes sense so two of these put together would make the bottom of the whole of the bag i've always wanted a denim bag so i decided to make my baguette bag out of a pair of my dad's old jeans so i put my bags template on and cut off the part of the jean that i needed then i flipped the denim inside out and drew around my template twice this makes both sides of the bag then i cut out the two halves of the bag and i also made sure that they were exactly the same size then i took some more of the denim fabric and cut out two of the longer templates for the bottom of the bag i then drew around it twice and then cut them both out [Music] i also decided to make some lining for the inside of my denim bag to make it thicker and i made the lining however i couldn't figure out how to fit it inside the denim bag and i think i did it in the wrong order so i ended up not using the lining at all but as this was the first bag i'd ever made i wasn't too mad and i'll just try and do it in the next bag that i make so all of the lighter blue more cotton looking fabric was supposed to be the lining of the bag but i ended up not using it in the end however i would recommend using it if you can figure out how to sew it in any help would be greatly appreciated these are just clips of me making the lining which i thought would be interesting to leave in even though i ended up not using them because they might be helpful for some people right now for the sewing part i then pinned the thicker side so the three inch sides of the bottom pieces together pretty sure it's cooled right sides together so i think that's what i did and then i sewed along the line where i pinned it then i cut out two small squares of denim fabric and pinned them to the zip i believe the zip i used was about 20 centimeters long and about an inch wide i then sewed along the line where i'd pinned it this bit was a bit confusing but i think the video is clearer than me explaining it once i turned the two pieces of fabric to the zip i then took one of the denim cutouts and faced it the right way up so the denim was facing me then i put the zip upside down on top of the denim and pinned it so that when i sew along that it will flip the right way up if that makes sense i then sewed along the zip and repeated the process the other side this is what it should look like [Music] then i turned the bag inside out slash upside down and i pinned the bottom of the bag to one of the sides again right sides together and then i sewed all the way around the edge of the bag i then repeated the process on the other side and made sure that between the end of the zip and the fabric there was a small gap for the handle to fit through i made the strap using the hem of my dad's jeans which meant that it was quite strong but also about the right length that i wanted i just kind of threw the strap over my shoulder and kept adding or taking away to the fabric to find the length that i wanted then with the bag inside out still i put the strap inside the bag and pulled each end through the each hole in the side of the bag that was left by the zip i made sure that the strap was facing the right way and that it was straight i pulled the strap out a small amount each side and then sewed across the gap to close it and also secure the strap in place i then cut off any excess and tidied up the edges this is what the corner should look like the denim on the inside of the bag was fraying a little bit so maybe next time i make this bag i'll try and hem the edges and this is the finished product i can't believe i just made a bag baby squeeze me", "ah-uVUWg8us": "have someone joining us to show us how we can make a french baguette at home welcome lizzy heaps the food nanny now i i when you said bread i'm all in but a baguette that's a whole new level tell us a little bit about what you got going on there well we love bread we feel like we're the queen of bread so we love to show all different kind of breads but we have a french baguette from start to finish only takes 30 minutes which is pretty incredible because other recipes it's a 24 hour process so i love to whip this up for lunches for dinner it's the fastest easiest bread you will ever do okay so show us how we can get this and i had no idea we could make it that quickly how do we do that okay so so fast so i've already had my yeast that's been going wow look how good that looks so we're going to add this is a half a cup of water and one and a half tablespoons of yeast and we've added one teaspoon of sugar we're going to add another teaspoon of sugar right into our bowl and then we're going to add two teaspoons of the best tasting salt in the world we actually import this salt from france it's the marriage to our camo flour you mentioned kamut tell us about kamu what is kamu yeah so kamoon is an ancient grain it's never been genetically modified it's 100 organic it's naturally enriched it's known for taste texture digestibility and it actually has less glue so i want to make sure we get the end of this and then i want to really quick mention the book too so you add the yeast mixture and then you add more water and you're just going to keep adding some flour until it starts coming away from the bowl so easy and then you would take it out on your counter you knead it just for a minute till it's nice soft and elastic and then this is how you shape it and these are my french baguette pans and my recipe tells you how to make four mini and it's perfect that looks amazing my mouth is watering you can get that recipe and so many more in your book what's the name of the book again yeah so my new book it's called for the love of commune it's all recipes written for camus because white wheat is a little it's a white wheat and it's a little more dense so i give you all these incredible recipes cake cookies bread because it replaces your all-purpose flour and it's the taste amazing on it looks amazing thank you so much for the love of kamut thank you", "CZvrs6-IsmQ": "it's food o'clock on real craft beer a few people asked me to make the wig and kebab all i thought of something after a friday night live stream with a few wonderful people at the stone crow virtual pub we discussed it together and here in barrie where i live it's a seaside resort it's the largest town in wales but it doesn't have its own staple dish so we're going to invent it we've invented or we're going to give it a go not the wig and kebab but the barry baguette so first of all what you need is some chips so we're gonna get the chips open like so get a cup of chips in a tree like so there we go that'll be only i'll grab a few more out of the bag you never have enough chips a couple of chips right there's your chips crinkle cut chips now what we have here in wales this is the largest pie company in wales they're called peters and they're based in cardiff this we've got here three minced beef and onion pies but i'm only gonna use one of them we're getting this open classic minced beef and onion pie chuck it in there and then we can chuck this straight in the oven gas max 7 leave that for i don't know 15 20 minutes i reckon maybe the chips are frozen 25 it's gonna be perfect another ingredient you're going to need and this is all i could find today is your curry sauce and it wouldn't be the berry baguette without your baguette so while that's cooking up let's get ourselves a bread bowl red knife now depending on how hungry you are you can you can make this baguette to how how it kind of sees fit for you i'm a big eater i'm a big eater so i'm going to cut i'm going to cut that right there [Music] what i was thinking of doing for this barrie baguette it's like piccadilly train station here the door's knocking all the time at the moment right back again so where did i put my knife over here so just i was thinking we got to get a pie in here so maybe cut it if i cut it down the side maybe that would be that would be the best answer there we go so i'm waiting on now the the pie and the chips in the oven so i'm gonna what i'll do i'll come back with a couple of minutes with the pie to go we'll stick some curry sauce in a little container chuck it in the microwave back in a moment okay so let's get this pie and chips out the oven so what we're gonna do grab the baguette i didn't bother buttering it we're gonna have a lot of kind of flavor now from the curry sauce that's going to be going on here oh grab only a pie turn it upside down i would no good oh should we now designing this designing this should we put a layer of chips no that's how they do the wig and kebab so let's do things a little bit differently let's get the pie down cut middle steak side up look at that we got room for some chips this is kind of working together thought process going on here all right we're in maybe get the chips on the side a minute and then work our way again i'm in to the kebab this is this is proper i'm sure my fellow barry people will thank me for this invention going forward i'm sure this is going to be a staple not just in barry but around around the uk the barry baguette there we are there's enough chips there i reckon or should we get a couple more in should we get them let's get them all in why not all right there we go [Music] now it's time for the curry sauce went in for about a minute here's a look at the curry sauce so we're going to get a little bit of that curry sauce over the top look look at that wigan has their kebab barry as his baguette look at this this might be the most famous thing ever to come out of my my town of baddie there we are i've made a mess for the thumbnail never mind right let's get into this right i'm going to take my jacket off the tackle this one it's a big one chuck that over there my goodness me there is the berry baguette minced beef and onion pie chips curry sauce in a baguette right this could get this could get really really messy oh straight into the pie oh burning my lips so combination pie chips and curry sauce straight away this is the beauty of this handheld food no need for a knife and fork can we get this it's piping not mind it's actually really good i've always loved the peter's pie grew up here in wales with a peter's pie it's quite a funny consistency really having like pie crust and in a baguette the pie is naturally kind of the pile is crunchy and then you got the the softness of the baguette and the meat in the pie is just making its way down to the bottom of the baguette the curry sauce is there in abundance um this is a lunchtime special everybody 28 pence for the curry sauce um the pies were two pounds fifty for three what's that seven five about 80 pence just under 80 pence for the pie the baguette was 50p the chips were well the cheap little chips you can pick a massive bag up for a quid or two [Music] so over to you everybody over to you i've made the barry baguette what i want from you now is your twitter pictures and your instagram pictures and your your youtube videos of the of the barry baguette and and your take on the barry baguet because it doesn't have to be exactly like this you can slightly tweak it but don't tweak it too much because this is beautiful honestly this is this is like i think i've invented something here i've invented something pretty special here miraculously i haven't dropped any and miraculously unless the curry sauces yeah yeah it is on my face yeah um oh i'm gonna go i'm gonna go in for the big bite used to use the meat and the chips and the curry and the ah let's get in oh no oh damn i've ruined my shirt maybe don't maybe don't overfill me oh look at my face look i've ruined my shirt everybody there's a look let's tidy this up a bit there we go so there was a look at the the barry kebab it got a little bit messy to what i think i got greedy with the bite hmm honestly that's a combination made in heaven i hope i've created something here that people will know and love for years to come rating my own invention that is brilliant give it a go over to you chris the

the video title the phenomenon is older than time itself I'm talking about this incredibly stupid thumbnail expressions and every time I stumble across one of those I really have the need to stick something in those faces something long like a French baguette [Music] [Music] after all it's pretty simple a thumbnail is like a cover for your story and if you are in a virtual bookshelf you want to make sure to be interesting and there is a lot of work you can put behind a great thumbnail to create an artwork which will actually create interest or you can just save it and make it be easy and

the baguette is a staple in french bakeries and pastry shops it is as iconic as the eiffel tower in paris along with another popular french bread the quaso but we'll talk about the quasong in another video baguettes are so in demand among the locals and tourists and probably the best-selling bread in the country did you know that there are 10 million baguettes sold every year in france they can be easily found in any luxury and they're very affordable you can buy a stick of baguette starting at 90 cent teams up to 1 euro depending on the variety and quality the baguette is often called the queen of french bread eating baguette is part of the daily lives of french people a staple in their diet you will often see local folks walking around holding a baguette it's widely available in local bakeries pastry shops and supermarkets well some experts and historians are having a debate about its origin some believe it was imported from vienna austria while others claim that it was invented in france by the bakers of napoleon around the 1920s it became widespread in paris the baguette consists of four main ingredients wheat flour salt water and yeast according to french law preservatives must never be added to the baguette what are the characteristics of a good baguette well the crust has to be crunchy outside and the core of the bread should be soft and tasty inside the aroma of the wheat should also be observed if it smells good it sure does taste good parisians and french people have their favorite boulangeries that serve the best tasting baguettes it is very easy to find the bakery because on every corner or street in paris you will surely find the boulangerie so if you're coming to france the first that i suggest you should do is buy a baguette from an artisan

going to do the baguette traditional baguette from France traditional baguette what you gonna need for doing is a baguette and then how we're gonna accomplish those each step until we get a nice baguette in a plate so we are gonna be concepts on flowers it's very important to get flowers or pupils flowers we are not on a bread flowers all people's flowers what else what else is room temperature we have a sourdough sourdough it's as a recipe will be follow up with the sourdough waters flowers and in what some of the water flowers and then we have this article's that sorry I cut myself we're gonna need flowers or Patrol's flowers not bright flowers waters and then we're gonna need stutters stutters it's very important for the chemistry of the bread the action of getting this fermentation this is a famine you like drinking beer maybe or knowing about thermal tension this is the same so here we're gonna get flowers and waters and yeast at the very beginnings the recipe is in the description we will not need any yeast afters this is a living space right here so with that being said this sourdough I've probably like nine months and feeding it every three days it's very important to grab it's very important to feed yourself although every times you're taking a part of it whatever you take you get a just add it to it if you don't use it you can just take it off a part of it and then add it to it the excess of part you can make a sourdough out of it or we can just trash it if you are afraid for the studies are so is like if living in vacations or if you don't have time to fit it you can put it in the freezer that will put it on pause the stutters and not have any issue with the status the static and I status or source I don't know what I'm gonna give you the flavors so very like the center of the pearl is your status you can also ask to your local bakers they can give you a piece of your sourdough I can also like give you some it's really sad we have some set and then driest dry yeast versus fresh yeast dry yeast you can find a pump back a pound packet it's can be out it can be a preserve outside we're just gonna active we say dry non active yeast we're just going to activate with some waters we need a mixing board we are going to need a whisk a knife a baguette tray this baguette tray is made for like professional ovens you can find one online half of this of this trace to fit in your oven I like to use a cardboard to transfer from this tray we're gonna see for proofing to the oven so we are now going to place our agent together we are studying by activate the dry yeast dry yeast is what's gonna make raise your bread pressing the yeast in one time in my mixing bowl adding the water to it and then you're gonna whisk the waters and the yeast together we are looking to get a phone a nice phone and I think the stutters to the water also a great point on the on the status the starters if it's been feed today you cannot use your studies until tomorrow so remembers if you feel it you get a living breathe for 12 hours I like to keep mine in the fridge not outside is still raising at 45 Fahrenheit 35 Fahrenheit I am NOT gonna have the flowers to the continent in one time we are looking to add the salt not in contact in direct contact with the yeast it will kill the yeast also stutters if the set will get in contact with the waters salt it's kosher salt we don't like yard salt it will give an effect and in chemistry chemical reactions to the bread and M will make it plain now with the help of my hands I am gonna now mix the bread so we are looking to work the butane just gonna add some waters slightly for take it off all the flowers out of the mixing bowl and you want to keep mixing the bread until you get nice chunks of baguette we are looking to really work the butan the baguette first turn is ready we are going to leave it in the mixing board with a wet cloth for about 45 minutes room table that shows it's very important to do that almost three time three to four time in each step 45 minute in between that gonna release the pressure we give on the glutens on the protein of the flowers gluten and then gonna let us be able to work more on this gluten this is what's going to give you the crust of the baguette secret of the crust of the baguette it sauce fold so we are going to leave it 45 minutes I've been waiting for 45 minutes for the door now I'm gonna give it my second fold take it off the clothes and I want to rework on the blue 10 so I'm gonna be looking to give the second fold I've been waiting 44 to 40 to 45 minutes and giving another fold we have to love the bread and bread text time I'm gonna bring it outside inside again pressing the close and we will leave it 45 minutes my second fold have been 45 minutes raising 45 min cleaning down now last fold and then we're going to detail our baguette outside inside now we are gonna cut in detail each baguette so at all we are singing about a half a pound singing half pound per baguette you can also doing eyeball for the tire and if you think here's X a meter slightly bigger than it was office you can add to it are we gonna give you like style baguette so you have your five piece here before we detail we're gonna still at them a little bit right so we're gonna prepare them to get shape so you're placing with this part of the hands right this is where you're not going to get hurt when you're gonna fold your bread so you want to use that part of the end and you're gonna want to plane your path of dough almost like a pizza here I'm gonna place each side inside you can give you like another fall right before the primetime and with a with my tongue I'm gonna get this sausage form of the baguette so same repetitions for each baguette again the side gonna bring it inside I want to use my wet clothes and I'm going to let them for 15 minutes and there's a wet clothes room temperatures for the wet clothes my baguettes I've been my my pattern have been a fifteen-minute raising now we're gonna shape our baguette very important also just to remain for the tray we get a baguette tray seeking you can get earth one to fit in the oven and I get up close the clothes and the tray is not going to go in the oven it's only for proofing the baguette if you don't have a trace it's easier for making sure is like they're not gonna reach each others and then stick during the proofing I'm gonna play some flowers some on my clothes enough flowers to make sure the baguettes not gonna stick the drop is close so close is dry very important to say closes dry and one by one I'm gonna shape my baguette baguette same operation from the previous operation for the beginning we plane the baguette and then we are gonna looking to get the top almost like a Swedish massage it's time to extreme in here bring the top part in the chrome service my tone gonna bring it down your hands so we are looking I'd bring it down so back it bring it back and down we are looking together a French size baguette so we want to get not around ends we're gonna look into shape the end to get something less let's run something more artisanal what we're looking to get something not coming out of a box so if you want to just like show off to your friends it looks nice so we're looking to use our ends the inside of the end Rises that path and gonna roll on the extremity of the door and I get is ready to go on the tray in Sim oppression for other the last bucket is ready I place also by get inside and now we're gonna let them proof couple option here for the proofing we can place a wet cloth on it we can cover all the baguette or the second options you can place it in an oven turn off so you turn off your oven you have half trays of baguettes we can fit in the oven you places this tray with the apron in sign oven off you boiling a pot of water the pot of for us is board placing it in the oven with a tray of baguettes the steaming process gonna give it like a sauna room to help the raising of the baguette what is very important we're not looking to get the baguette dry on top with that explaining is like if you let it on the countertop with not covering you will get a baguette dry on top it's gonna break so again to couple options always making sure to get the top wet with a cloth or in an oven off and then getting a proofing box we have now I'll buy get proofed so baguette is prove how do we know I punch it and is going back directly so my baguettes gonna go in the oven I have a tray upside down for you will be alpha tray placing it some flowers making sure is not going to stick and then with a cowbell I'm gonna grab the baguette and place it on my tray and in here we have our baguette on our tray try to be gentle and then take it off as much flowers as I can from the top make sure there is space in between you know that this point I'm going to use my knife and then starting to blade this baguette so you want to make sure no one is behind and then you're gonna do an incision on toast baguette and we're gonna place them in the oven an oven at 500 Fahrenheit for you at home 445 you don't want to push it too much to reach the top of the maximum top to observe one then we're going to let them for probably like 15 to 20 minutes so we have now a baguette out of the oven my baguette it's cooked she's a way to know if it's cook or not it better you get a sounds hollow inside here we're gonna kill it and we want to hear the Sinfonia of the bread you want to hear resist noise on the baguette and get the baguette finish product a nice crust very important and in a again as I get was I found an 85 a night in the oven I hope you enjoyed my master class baguette please don't hesitate to watch again this video if you miss some path and in asking any questions I hope you I get taste good place some butter on it some start and enjoy this is what pasty I came in friendship Buffalo New York thank you [Music]", "nadcrWzKQ80": "[Music] welcome back everybody so today we're making no-knead baguettes which are very easy to make the first thing you'll need is 500 grams of white bread flour then you'll need 1 packet of dried instant yeast and 1 teaspoon of salt then mix your dry ingredients together and add 380 mil of lukewarm water so baguette dough has more water than a typical bread dough and that's really important the added water makes for a more elastic and lighter dough with more air bubbles and the great thing is about this though you don't have to knead at all or use your hands you can just mix the dough with the pork and here I'm just testing the consistency of the dough with my fingers and seeing if it's too moist or moist enough when a dough comes together put a towel over the fold and then it's ready to rise this will take about 4 hours which is very long but at least it's no effort after four hours you can lift off your towel and you'll see that your dough has at least doubled in size this long fermentation is really important to develop the dough especially because you're not kneading it and it creates an elastic and light and a very tasty bread dough then put your dough on a work surface and divide it into two then shape your baguettes try not to use too much flour just dust your hands with as much flour as you need and put enough flour on the work surface so the dough doesn't stick too much when shaping the baguettes try to keep the dough as tight as possible you want a nice tight baguette shape but don't worry if the shape of your forgets isn't perfect mine aren't and they still turn out really good and baguettes on the floured baking sheet now I'm putting a container with water into the oven to create steam which mimics a professional bread oven place a container with water into the oven while you preheat it to 240 degrees Celsius when your baguettes have rested for half an hour you can score or slice the baguettes this is to prevent the bread splitting in unexpected places during the baking process it also makes the bread look really nice and gives a nice crunch to the finished product I also spray my baguettes with water just before I bake them to give an extra crunchy crust so you want to bake your baguettes at 240 degrees Celsius for about 25 to 30 minutes and after that you just take the baguettes out and let them cool off on a cooling rack now don't these look great they smell fantastic and I'm sure they'll taste amazing I really hope you enjoyed my video if you have any questions leave me a comment and I will see you next time but for now enjoy the sound of these amazing baguettes", "4hJi66dUb2c": "take 27 let's try this again hey guys welcome back to my channel thank you so much for watching and in today's video I am going to be sharing with you one of my new to me Fendi baguette and I will share a back story with you guys I will also show my shots of this bag on and I am super excited to show this to you guys I have been kind of hiding it back from you I posted something on my stories on Instagram after I sold a few of my bags so that I can purchase this bag and anyways if you're not following me on Instagram definitely check me out over there my name is going to be under here to tread the thread under spork and I post all my outfits my looks my bag of the day Oh stuff like that so definitely check me out on there sometimes I share things there before I do here and I also wanted to thank whoever joined my giveaway with the beautiful ladies I just had a giveaway with a few of my girls on YouTube and Instagram and that was so much fun and definitely keep an eye out for further giveaways because I definitely want to be doing some more of those what else before I get into this video oh yes stay tuned to the end of the video because I do have a little Chanel reveal as well stuff without further ado let me just show you the beauty I'm so excited as I'm like speechless of this it is freaking gorgeous so this is the Fendi baguette in the large size with the black FF embossed leather I believe it is lambskin leather it is a little it is definitely super super buttery and soft but I think it's gonna be a little bit more durable than the Chanel lambskin and you can't tell I a little backstory on this bag I have been wanting this bag since I first ever saw it I've been dying over it and I just was not gonna pay the retail price for it I think it retails for about like 30 190 something crazy to me that's like Chanel money and yeah so I said you know what let me wait and see if it's on the retail resale pre-loved market and I said I was like I don't know how I'm gonna wait for this bag whatever so I actually went to try it on because just to like get it off of my mind not that that would get it off my mind but just like get it out of my system and I tried it on him the white and I fell in love with the white however realistically white is not a bad that I would probably go for especially because I know how I am with my bags I don't take care of them very well I mean I take care of them but I don't like to baby them so as much as I love the white it just was not gonna work for me and I tried the medium size and it did not look as good as this looked at me now the reason why I love this large size so much is because of the fact that it's different it's quirky it's like a new twist on the classic baguette and I just think nobody's giving up get the size I feel like people are gonna go towards the medium-sized because they think it's more classic and I don't know I just love this freaking bed and I'm actually surprised that a lot of people did not jump on this bag so yes I am in love now I did purchase this pre-loved and I paid literally less than half the price after tax like with tax it would be like 3,600 so I paid like wait I got like 60% off or even more than that and I did just sell two bags two bags and a couple other things and so I actually had leftover money from those sales after even purchasing this so yes I am so happy about this I do want to share like I said my chalk to also show you guys what's inside so it is super super roommate I don't even have it filled but I will add a couple other things and so that you guys can see I have my HRH a big pouch my mini push net accessory I love this this is definitely an item that you guys need especially if you're starting out with luxury goods I keep my money in and all my stuff in there my YSL card holder this is the number one for me I don't go anywhere without that my six ring key holder two lipsticks and then I just have a receipt and some feminine products in there so I am gonna put that stuff back in because like I said I wanted to show you guys what fits and I am going to add in my this is a Chanel sunglasses case and let's just say this was my camera since this is the case to my camera and guys there's still room that is ridiculous like seriously that is crazy so just close it yeah oh yeah there's plenty of room the only negative thing I have to say about this bag is that it will tend to those its shape I see from the previous owner that there's like kind of like a dead from the leather there but to be honest with you that's gonna happen with where I guess they were holding it by the strap by the top handle I probably won't be wearing it that way maybe unless I have like very light amount of things in here but yeah I think that the leather being so soft in the long run might make it not my let's shape get lost sorry I can't speak today the shape will probably the bag will lose its shape but I am thinking to reach out to small more that or small though I don't know how to pronounce them but they make back on organizers and I'm thinking to reach out to them and seeing if they can make me and organizer for this so that maybe it'll help hold its shape anyways let me show you the back on so this is it on the shoulder and then my favorite way is crossbody because I just think it's it's like perfectly hive that makes any sense and I just think it's so freaking amazing like legit so yeah there is my Fendi baguette for you guys and I don't know what else I'm trying to think of what what I can end it out shots are removable so you can remove this top handle and you can remove this one as you guys probably know already Fendi does make so many different accessories for their bags so you can change the strap I do own a Fendi Zuka strap that I will most definitely be adding on to this baby I think it is about the size of this strap that it comes with the strap is so comfortable because the leather is so buttery and yeah that's it for this bag guys definitely let me know what you think about this and lastly make sure this quick little goodie you guys guess what it is I only own one other jewelry from Chanel it's my Chanel CC earrings and I hope this is gonna like show up the right way oh there it is it says oh I hope you can see it it's not showing up but it says Chanel and Italy is just about there and I think it is so pretty I picked it up on a pre loved market so I saved a lot of money and I loved it what do you guys think what else yes so thank you guys for watching everything that I have on in this video will be linked down below I will also link the Fendi baguette below and I hope you guys love my video please consider subscribing to my channel I would love to have you guys back and thank you I'll see you next time bye", "ulxjskKodUk": "hi I'm Hendrik and I'm making sourdough / guest today [Music] [Music] now I personally believe that sourdough baguettes are far tastier and actually a lot easier to make than regular baguettes but this is really only you know the case if you have two ingredients or utensils one essential ingredient is your sourdough starter now this is really important you need to have sorry started to make a sourdough and if you don't know how to make a sourdough starter there's a link on my right here where you can see how I make it the other thing which is really essential is one of these baguette baking trays now making baguettes and the conventional oven is always going to be a problem you're not going to be able to have these really long massive baguettes you know and with a sourdough you always need something to keep its shape and these you know baking trays for baguettes are perfect so the dough will be able to rise evenly and triple in size what you really want or really good forgets forget baking trays are really easy to find online like on Amazon you know so just look it up and they're really not expensive I found them really handy for me you know but yet so do you consider you know getting one of these here are all my ingredients and making this dough couldn't be simpler you know it's a lot easier than normal applicat though so I've got my sourdough starter I'm going to use a ladle full of that I've got salt on I'm gonna be using about you know half teaspoon probably about I have 200 grams of strong white bread flour really good quality flowers important and then I have 125 mils of lukewarm water and I'm just going to assemble all these ingredients mix them together in my Kitchen Aid and then the dough is pretty much done [Music] now our dope is a really wet dough so what I'm doing man even if you're in anything by hand or using a KitchenAid it's a good idea to you know use a bit of flour just at the end so you can shape it so I'm just going to handsome flour trip and then run the KitchenAid for half a minute until the dough comes loose and I can take it up with my hands so much goes right now it's still pretty wet I'm gonna use quite a bit flour to get it up what you really wanted to be quite wet there we go now take a knife I'm just dividing it into two for my two baguettes see it's very sticky I'm gonna put some more flour on it and now I'm going to weigh the two halves just to make sure that they're pretty much the same so just over 200 grams you know they're about 220 grams each so it's not very big but you know that's really you know well what you want because our dough is going to triple in size and obviously you know our again baking tray isn't very big so you won't end up with really big forgets but they are going to you know rise part of it and what later we'll be ere now I'm showing you how to shape your baguettes it's really quite simple on it's not an exact science I just tried to shape my dough a bit into around in my hands and then you're sort of trying to create its name so here are two baguettes I'm just going to dust them now with some flour to make sure they won't stick too much you know and just cover them with a kitchen towel and leave them somewhere warm overnight now they will have to rise for quite a bit because it's sourdough and you know you do want the dough triple in size as I've said before so if you're doing this during the day it might take you know quite a few hours so just make sure that the dough ride is really well and then you can pick it so we'll see each other tomorrow morning good morning everybody our baguettes are ready to go into the oven now let's have a look they have yep tripled in size so that's perfect and now that really ready to go I'm not gonna score the tops you know slice it should ask you what most brands were most baguettes because they're in this shape they will hold their shape and not spill it everywhere it will just open natural seam so look quite rustic like a French baguette to combine so yeah I'm just gonna put this into the oven and children fifty degrees Celsius and they'll bake for about 10 minutes and I should be done [Applause] [Music] here we are our baguettes are done and it look really amazing really rustic they weren't for about 12 minutes and I'm now just going to leave them and rest on a cooling rack 20 minutes or so until they've cooled down and I'm gonna slice them open so I'm now going to cut ensure we get to have a look since very nice and airy you know and that's really because the sourdough there's lots of air bubbles and that's really great and it makes for a really nice soft inside and outside its really nice and crunchy so that's really great stuff so yeah I hope you enjoyed the video you know it's a really easy recipe it couldn't be easier to make these baguettes you know you just have to learn how to make a sourdough Vaness on you know difficult at all so yeah I hope you try this recipe please let me know in the comment section how it went and if you enjoyed it thanks for watching [Music] you [Music]", "NSnUN-2oSng": "this job and how much he was going to put up with to get it

going to the beach wait [Music] where are you well oh my god [Music] [Applause] [Music] wait [Music] [Applause]", "2E8NZnC3gGE": "the essence of bread is basically a little bit of starter flour water and salt that's it you can see that beautiful crust I'm always going for really crispy crusty bread this is flour good water either a natural yeast or an artificial yeast Baker's use instant yeast not that active dry yeast that you buy in the grocery store sometimes in those little jars those we used to use it but you and then you'd have to put a little bit of warm water and a little bit of sugar and get it bubbly and then pour it in this you just pour in whenever you want and it it works so I added starter plus yeast so why am i doing that the yeast will do the job itself but I won't have as much flavor if I'm trying to get this bread made quick I can make this bread in about maybe two hours I can make it faster if I really want it to if the faster you make bread the less flavor it has so by adding something that already has a lot of flavor it's kind of like a cheat so I always add a splash of starter and every bread I make and what is it starter it's a it's alive basically it's just fermented dough that you keep always feeding like an animal the super tangy you can see it bubbling this is what sourdough basically is [Music] okay if you don't have a scale and you like to bake you should buy yourself the scale first to turn your scale on you turn it on with the bowl on and then it's already at zero for you I'm going into kilograms so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with my water if it feels warm to my finger it's warmer than 98 degrees which is my body temperature I just want something that I can barely feel right that's a good temperature so we need 315 so then I rescale the the scaled it up back to zero I'm gonna go for my white flour and do 500 so I only need 150 which is gonna be hard in this add a little yeast I only need five grams it's roughly that so now the last thing is salt and I never want to pour salt directly on the yeast if you put salt on your yeast it'll kill it [Music] basically it's just juicing it together with your hands this is what we call a shaggy mass it's not fully together yet what you want to do is you just want to get together so it all looks similar and you're just trying to get it to a point like this and you can already see that there's glue and gluten is this stringy stuff that's keeping the flour bits together basically that's what it should look like you're just going to work it and you can either do this and keep doing this and if that's how you want to do it but the traditional way is to use your palm and you're going to need it you're gonna push and then pull it back with the other hand push push push and if you find it's getting sticky eventually it'll get less sticky once it's finished you just keep adding a little just a teeny more flour don't go crazy with the flour because then you're gonna make a really tough dough you still want it to be moist and so you're just gonna keep pushing and you can find your own way maybe it's like this this I don't know so now what the process is is you let it rise once till it gets a little bit doesn't have to be doubled but it has to be bigger and puffy so we always cover this with something but you have these all look really good [Music] once it rises we're gonna cut it in half this will be one loaf that'll be the another loaf and we're gonna shape them into what we call long but tardes so basically you just want to cut your dough in half now you don't need a scraper but if you want to use one you're more than happy to you can also just tear it just try to get to even loaves of dough they've proofed a little bit they've developed some flavor the glutens developed but you can see how I can stretch it and it's really thin it's obviously a lot better than it was and over time it's just going to get even more so so what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a smooth surface and we're gonna shape it and then we're gonna let it proof again and then it's ready for baking if I don't let this proof and I've squished all that air out it's just gonna be dense and it's not going to have that nice texture so what we're gonna do is you take your lump of bread after you've made two balls and you make the balls after you've split them you're just gonna gonna like tuck them like that don't work them too much it's because you don't want to destroy all that air so then you take one of them you give a little flour you kind of you flip it the smooth surface down you kind of Pat it out a little bit don't go crazy you're not like smooshing it flat you're just kind of gently doing that you're going to go like this like this you're keeping that surface tight but I'm starting to get it into the shape that I want I'm starting to get it into that long stick so I get it to that point and then I'm gonna roll it over from the middle and I'm gonna keep rocking and rolling back and forth you're gonna put pressure down not too much and you're gonna keep putting the pressure down but keep kind of pulling pulling out you want to get it even yeah usually you will take about maybe 30 minutes these have only been what like 10 15 yeah not not long at all and you can feel that there's still kind of a little dense you can score it that gives it those nice lines though the deeper you cut like these will look nicer and then you'll get your board you don't have to have a board and then when it's nice and puffy all I do is it should be sliding because it still has a little bit of flour and you're just gonna chuck it in the oven now the last thing I do just to get some crispy crust is I'm gonna throw some water in there and I'm gonna throw it at the back and I make sure I hold really tightly under my cup because I don't want that to smash in there and then I quickly cover it [Music] Chris these are pretty look at that beautiful beautiful and when you taste it there's really nothing like it with fresh butter [Music]", "Ta4N_qc6g1E": "welcome back to dream guy tv guys it is your host vince crazy back with another video if

link it would save a ton of money and help support this channel but anyway so guys before we get into this detailed review let's go ahead and check out some b-roll footage so you can see this piece up close in person [Music] hmm [Music] hey [Music] oh [Music] hmm hey [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me hey so guys as you can see we have the all-new world premiere of the shop g-o-d baguette chain-link bracelet and white gold guys dream guy tv we're always dropping the highest content in the game so guys in terms of this piece this piece is 14 karat white gold plated five times over stainless steel okay this is not going to change risk ring okay in terms of price this particular piece here was 199 dollars you can also get this in the 14 karat solid white gold option with vs diamonds for 42 three hundred and fifty three dollars okay so in terms of length okay you can get this particular piece in seven inches in length and eight inches in length okay so if you want to know how to get your wrist size is very very easy okay you just take a piece of string wrap it around your wrist make sure it's a comfortable fit then you want to take the string put it against a ruler or a tape measure and that's how you figure out exactly what your wrist size is okay so shop gld on the product page they do have an example of how you can measure your wrist so please before you purchase this piece make sure that you measure your wrist so you can have the correct size but anyway so guys in terms of the width this particular piece measures 15 millimeters in width and i do have my caliper here so we can check and verify to make sure that this sharp gld bracelet is actually true to size okay so just looking at this piece guys the craftsmanship on this piece is crazy um they're very very nice tight links the baguette czs man i'm telling you man shop god really takes their time on their jury and setting their stones you can see the back here if you look here the shop god class and baguettes y'all check that out okay you can also see the back side here okay what i'm going to do now guys let me show you guys exactly how to put this bracelet on okay so it's very very easy all you do is you just release this class right here boom take the mail in put in the female end just like so okay you lock it right in here okay so this is very tight this brace is not going anywhere okay so what i'm going to do now let me go ahead and put this in my wrist so i can give you guys a wrist profile so guys this is the official wrist profile of the shop god baguette chain link bracelet guys in this particular bracelet is seven inches in length what i can tell you right now this bracelet is kind of tight okay so the way this works is guys the thicker your bracelet is the tighter it's gonna be okay so as you know i do have a seven inch five millimeter miami cuban length chain from shop gld and i also have a seven and a half inch five millimeter miami cube from daniel's jewelry okay so for the shop gld bracelet it is seven inches in length so but it's only five millimeters so i had to have some wiggle room okay so with this particular bracelet being that it is 15 millimeters in length is very very tight i can barely move my wrist guys okay so for this particular product if you want to get this one you probably want to go a size up my wrist measures right around seven inches so you want to go to a size 8 just because it's 15 millimeters in width look at look at this guys look at my wrist okay my wrist can't even go fully down because it's so tight because it's 15 millimeters but the 5 millimeter is about this small so it lets me flex a little bit but this particular bracelet will not flex guys so so if you have like a six and three quarters wrist or seven inch wrist you wanna go ahead and go up to the eight millimeter so that you can fully enjoy this bracelet it's still a nice bracelet guys but i'm gonna be honest with you it's not that comfortable because i should have went for a size eight okay my wrist is about a seven you know what i mean so went for seven because with shop god they don't have half inch increments so if you want a half inch increment you can reach out to customer service they can custom make it for you it is going to be an additional cost and things like that but this piece only comes in seven and eight inch increments guys so if you're close to about a seven or seven go with the eight it's gonna fit you perfectly okay so what i'm going to do now let me cut off the lights here so we can do an official shine test whoa guys this is the official shine test of the shop gld baguette chain link bracelet and then white gold okay i know what you're probably asking vince grizzy why isn't this bracelet on your wrist okay so guys i tried to take this bracelet off my wrist almost slit my dang ol wrist trying to get this bracelet off okay this vid this bracelet is very very tight i'm telling you i have a seven inch wrist this is a seven inch bracelet guys i was saying prayers from when i was five years old i couldn't even remember those prayers until today guys this particular bracelet was so tight i thought i was going to have to go to the er jesus christ okay quit dripping out tv this reason i did not follow my own device obviously this piece is seven inches in length but i'm telling you my wrist is seven inches in length i should have went for the size eight there is no way in god's green earth that i could wear this bracelet okay i can technically wear this bracelet but guys it is too tight for me i had to get a butter knife just to get this thing off guys thankfully i did not scratch it i did not damage this piece or anything like that um obviously i will be keeping this piece i may be doing a giveaway on this piece okay so y'all gotta stay tuned maybe next year something like that but guys i cannot really wear this piece because it is too tight for me i should have known with 15 millimeters it would be a lot tighter than the 5 millimeter i know it sounds stupid but guys make sure if you're a man i think i have small wrists make sure that you go for the eight inch option i should have known when the eight inch option was completely sold out that's probably exactly what happened okay so guys when you go for this piece right here i don't care if you have a small wrist go for the eight inch option because the seven inch option is going to be way too tight but in terms of the shine it's definitely an excellent shine it's excellent piece excellent craftsmanship man i'm telling you man shop god they do not disappoint you guys see those baguettes right there okay they're shining and hitting from every single angle every single angle you see the shop geode class right there it's crazy guys okay so what we're going to do now let me go ahead and get out my caliper and down the selector and see if it is true to size in terms of the width and see if it will pass the diamond selector test okay we're hitting it 15.9 shot gld listed this at 15 millimeters okay let's check another point it says 16 millimeters right there let's check another point [Music] 15.8 okay so guys this is actually great news um this particular bracelet is not true to size it does say 15 millimeters but guys you can never be mad when a jewelry company gives you actually more millimeters than you asked for okay so these run between 16 15.9 and 15.8 millimeters so guys that's actually a good thing you're getting more bang for your buck so shop gld actually gave you more millimeters than you paid for okay so let me go ahead and get out my dom selector here and see if we'll pass the diamond selector test all right got my down selector here let's start off with level four okay it's just hitting yellow not doing too much let's see uh-oh look look it's hidden let's try another point here whoa y'all hear that hit me baby one more time [Music] so guys so this particular piece did hit three times so i can say definitively that this particular god baguette chain link bracelet in the white gold will pass the diamond selector test so guys if you like videos like these please remember like subscribe to

created this baguette bag keep watching hey guys welcome back to another video so in this video you're going to need these materials we're then going to start with our paper first it means to take any pair of paper you have and we're going to use a paper to form the shape of our bag I wanted a small bag so obviously I'm going to make my paper small and then you're going to take any curved object you have to form the curved outer circle you're then going to take a new ruler that you have to form a triangle right next right on top of the curve angle you choose true now I didn't have a ruler so I had to improvise what I do have really I just couldn't find my honey but I had to improvise but you would join triangle right there on top of the curve you just made fold your paper over cut in the outer edge again we're going to join the triangle on the other side I'm going to take my first fabric that I have this is a leather fabric obviously you don't have to use a lot of fabric but I wanted to have a leather lining inside so I used another fabric and I cut two pieces if you have interfacing preferably use the interface in then we're going to move on to the outer fabric we're going to cut two pieces from this outer fabric I didn't like hot the top was a straight line so I wanted me to give it a little bit of sheep well I fold it in half then cut a curved line towards the center so I'm going to put it back on top of my fabric and cut out the new piece I just cut so we're going to then cut out the triangle pieces from both fabrics so then we're going to sew a straight line where the triangle piece is where we're then going to work on the outer piece we're going to fold over a quarter of an inch at the top of the fabric and we're going to do this for both pieces we're then going to sew a straight line after so I'm gonna show you line and look something like this the only thing missing from the materials that I showed earlier in the video was a zipper you're going to take any zipper that you have or a color that matches with your bag and in this case I had two orange so I thought what a perfect idea we're going to then place one side of the fabric on one side of the zipper and we're going to pin it we're going to then open it up and place the other side of the fabric onto the zipper and penny you're going to then sew a shirt line this is how it look after we sold our line we're going to then close it up fold it over pin it and sew all the way around it when you're sewing all the way around it leave a little bit of space at the top where the zipper is because you're going to need that space later so we're basically going to sew our u shape remember for that whole we're going to insert our finger into a hole and trying to open the zipper up after that we're going to flip it over we're going to then work on the inside piece we're going to take both fabrics place them together right size touching each other we're going to pin it and then pin the top as well you're going to fold it over about half an age we're going to then soil you shape and sew a straight line across and we're going to insert the outer fabric inside the inner fabric we're going to then pin all the way around it at the Penan we're going to sew all the way around we're then going to reverse it inside out and we're going to tuck the flaps of the zipper inside the bag so far it's coming out good we're just missing those traps you're then going to cut a 23 inch and a quarter inch strand we're going to fold it in half and we're going to use the measurement from the hab to cut out from the other fabric we're going to then insert it inside fold each side over pin it and sew two straight lines down the center we're then going to insert the straps so this is the outcome of the bag this is my first time that I actually ever made a bag before so I think it came out pretty well for my first time don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and thank you guys for watching my

rolex sky dweller with the chocolate dial something like this retails for around 45 thousands it also comes in the rhodium dial this one's an actual 2021 watch this is a brand new piece never been worn the chocolate dial tends to get a little bit more of a premium compared to the rhodium this is the new batten dial so the chocolate and the rhodium these are both new dials previous to that was the now discontinued roman dial [Music] [Music] at the moment can i give you a call back in maybe half an hour or so sick watch out yes but i don't know the buzz about them though because i like i don't know why the blue and the black and the streets just jumped up massively manson yeah so you can get custom dials for the steel daytona like people do right so you can never map you kind of get that bezel so the watch has just gone mad recently so it's like you're pretty much near enough 100k watch out them one's in the blue that one in the blue face there made some serious things so that that watch was originally it was always around 50k ish yeah but now it jumped like 20 to 30 grand mad isn't it and originally it was like 20 low 20s retail and before that like an older version was like 15 or 16 grand i think retail 50 thousand now yeah we're asking this we're asking 80. it's online for 80 grand serious it's 57 40. that's a wrong 150 but it's still so that's an anderson white gold where that's steel all of them even the 59.90 in there yeah the 59.90 the 5980 is a thicker case and so is the five 980 in in the nautilus right so this the this one the 57 12 the 57 11 that's how that has the air the smaller width of case right so it's not as chunky but you like you prefer chunky wattage [Music] just look at that platinum daytona platinum daytona with the factory baguette dial 20 20. look at the weight yeah you can tell the weight of the watch compared over yellow gold or rose gold yeah so that watch uh initially when you first inquired about that watch maybe a month or so ago it was probably trading for around 70 75k it's jumped up around 20 000 pounds so it's it's ballpark price is around 90 to 100. the actual market price for that watch [Music] just received this new watch so this watch comes with obviously its original box you've got your warranty card so it's the new model with the new updated movement so the yacht-master 40 model also comes in rose and

40 rhodium dial with the baby blue detailing with the platinum bezel we've also got the 37 mil so this is the two together so you can see the size comparison obviously the 40 being the dense watch and

Spring keeps us young. Youthful hope and love. Run towards the forces that open the soil and broaden the afternoon. Caught a glimpse of crocus bathing in the grand sunlight. The desire to create something. Something I haven't done before. When it comes to Vietnamese cuisine, few dishes are as popular outside of Vietnam as 'B\u00e1nh M\u00ec'. During the colonial period in the second half of the 19th century, the French brought their baguette to Vietnam, This French-origin bread quickly gained popularity and. That was when the Saigonese turned the baguette into typical Vietnamese bread. The closed structure allows the steam to be retained inside, makes the baguettes become more hollow, spongy inside, the crumb is soft and chewy and the top crust is light and crisp. This is the characteristic that creates the unique identity of Vietnamese baguette compared to French baguette. Over time, 'Banh Mi' has been widely spread and localized even further to suit our taste. The squishy part is softer, the crust is lighter and more crisp. It got much smaller so it's convenient to carry as a comfort street food. It also became a \"national fast food\" for everyone because of its diversity, convenience and most importantly, its very low price. 400 gr bread flour (at least 13% protein) Or 387.5 gr bread flour (11% protein) + 12.5 gr vital wheat gluten) 10 gr instant yeast 12 gr sugar 4 gr salt 280ml cold water Mix well, let the dough rest for 5-10 minutes. Gradually raise the speed from low to high for 5 minutes. Let it rest for 7-10 minutes.  Beat it for 7 minutes or until the dough is smooth, not sticky, and you're able to pull a thin film. Spread oil evenly on the surface of the dough and the bowl. Incubate in a humid place, 25-30 \u00b0C for 60-90 minutes until the dough doubles in size. Gently take out the dough, divide it into parts, I personally make 85 gr baguette so this dough is enough for 8 portions. Now it's the time to shape them. Try remembering how you felt when you first tasted Banh Mi. As soon as you have the first bite, you are not only delighted by the crunchy crust, but also be absorbed in the throbbing sound of crumbling in your mouth. Then comes the soft part - it's like a cotton cushion inside, which is getting even softer because it is soaked with butter and gravy, and rich sauce. Incubate them until doubled in size. Pre-heat the oven at 240 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. Spray water over the baguettes. Dip razor in oil and slit a line on top of the baguette. Bake at 240 \u00b0C for the first 8 minutes. Next 7 minutes at 220 \u00b0C. 'Banh Mi' may look simple but baking it really is a sophisticated process. It all boils down to gathering experience and tips after each attempt and less about the recipe. Leave them in the oven for a few minutes after turning off. This was my first attempt. The crust is quite crisp and crunchy. But inside it needs to be more hollow and chewy. And this was the third attempt. The inside shouldn't break when you pull it apart. The first filling: Vietnamese Grilled Pork Skewers 1kg of pork shoulder (or 700g lean pork shoulder and 300g pork belly) Marinate with 1 Shallot, 4 garlic cloves, 2 chopped lemongrass stalks. 6 tbsp caramel sauce, 4 tbsp fish sauce. 2 tbsp oyster sauce. 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp pepper. 1 tbsp white sesame. Mix well and marinate for at least 12 hours. The cooking time & temperature depends on the size of the skewer. I personally cook for 9 minutes at 200 \u00b0C. Second filling: Char siu bbq pork 50gr char siu powder with 130ml of water. 1 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 tbsp soy sauce. 1 tbsp fish sauce. 1 tbsp white wine, 1 tbsp honey. 4 garlic cloves and 1 thinly sliced \u200b\u200bshallot. Pinch of pepper and cooking oil. Let it cool down and marinate with 700 gr pork meat. Let it marinate for at least a day (in the fridge). Cook for 25 minutes at 190 \u00b0C. I also made vegetarian char siu with porcini mushrooms. The recipe is exactly the same as the meat version. But do not marinate the mushroom with the mixture but braise it on low heat for 25 to 30 minutes. My friend made this vegetarian sausage from Seitan. Even the simplest version of 'Banh Mi', just liver pate sandwiches, are enough to awaken your taste buds. The filling comes with endless possibilities of ingredients:  Char siu bbq pork, ham, pork floss, Vietnamese pork sausage, fried eggs, pork skin, minced pork meatball, fish patty, sauteed fish, shredded chicken, tofu... each vendor has its own secret. It's really a feast for your taste buds. The strong and richness of the filling will be balanced with a little sour, light taste of cucumbers, pickles, or simply herbs, then all covered within the crunchy magic. It's delicious to the last bite. Char siu bbq pork 'Banh Mi' Vegetarian 'Banh Mi' (Seitan sausage & mushroom) Grilled pork skewer 'Banh Mi' Talking about Vietnamese beef stew made me hungry! 500gr beef shank. Marinate with 1 shallot, 5 garlic cloves, minced ginger. 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp salt. 1 tsp cinnamon powder and pepper. 80ml red wine. Marinate until the wine is fully absorbed into the meat. Sautee two tomatoes. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Remember to skim off the foam often. Stew until meat is tender. Add tapioca starch to thicken the sauce. Most stalls selling Banh Mi on the streets of Vietnam  charge around one dollar for a Banh Mi. Been to so many countries, I don\u2019t know any other food that can offer such high quality food for that price! 'Banh Mi\" is really an explosion of flavors and textures: Salty, sweet, sour, spicy, crunchy, chewy, soft. An incredible fusion of all flavors. Now I'm making mini 'Banh Mi' for Alexia ^^ I use the same recipe as normal 'Banh Mi' Don't place them too close like this ^^ 'Banh Mi' with condensed milk for breakfast! This right here was my childhood! And now I'm giving Alexia a piece of it. We are tied to the memories of our past, our childhood will keep the child in us. And for me, it's beautiful.", "qe99zQVIskw": "before this video starts i wanted to say that i'm doing a giveaway on my twitch channel right now where i'm giving away three tier eight tech tree tanks

[Music] [Music] spicy [Music] oh [Music] you", "jYdry_QoIiM": "hi guys welcome back to Phil's kitchen so today I'm going to show you an amazing recipe and it's all about French baguettes I really love baguettes because I like slapping them with soup or my favorite chai but you can go ahead and stop with anything you want so they are better crusty and chewy on the outside and very soft on the inside the good thing I like about making baguette is that it requires only four ingredients guys four ingredients so without saying more let's get started so we'll start by adding three cups of all-purpose flour into a bowl to that you will add one tablespoon of yeast two teaspoons of salt and mix that well next we will add warm water so I'm using two cups of warm water and then we are going to give this a good knead until it forms a very nice taquito [Music] once you are done mixing we are going to cover the dough and keep it in a warm place let it rise for one and a half hours so I had another dough rising earlier and here it is so this has risen for one hour not even one and a half hours so we're going to add flour on top and then you're going to transfer all the door to a flat surface make sure your surface has more extra flour because this process needs a lot of kneading so you're transferring all the top of the ball to the flat puppies make sure sockets have more more flour cause at this point the dough is too sticky so we are going to just add more flour and then start kneading remember all we need is just a soft and smooth dough so I'm just adding more flour and we're going to need this for a good ten minutes as you can see I'm trying to just fold it in and roll it out whichever technique to using make sure your door is not too much sticky you can use a stand mixer which will speed up the process but I'm just using my hands so the dough is ready and we are going to cut it into six equal pieces once then take each piece and roll into small small balls so now it's time to shape the Pug a subject each dough piece try to pull the edges of the dough into the center then after that we are going to roll it until we get very nice long vacation this process is not easy it just requires patience in time so you're going to fit off the process for all the remaining dough pieces until you're done [Music] once done line them on a tray that is flat make sure there is a space between them so that they don't come into contact when they are rising so you're going to prove this for another 45 minutes just cover and set them in a warm place after 45 minutes they have doubled in size I can see mines have touched each other this means that I used a very small choice but there was no space but anyway after baking they still came out great so I'm making small slits on top of each pocket this going to give them like a nice nice shape and then a sprinkle a little bit of flour after that I'm going to bake this in the oven for a good 20 minutes until they are done and nicely crispy and browned and that's it guys there you have it freshly baked buckets [Music] so if you like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up don't forget subscribe don't forget to comment and share and also you can find me on instagram on clothes for kitchen or on facebook at their kitchen so till my next video bye [Music] [Music]", "VIkWPppvnQ4": "the hot snake for lunch time it's about three criterias it has to be great food uncomplicated and extremely fast in this video i will present you the classic sandwich par excellence it's a baguette a hot baguette with ham and cheese and tomatoes and this so fast uncomplete uncomplicated and valuable that you really have to look how it works later on in this video i'm also going to show you a packaging where you can prepare a series of these sandwiches and roll them up in this ovenable packaging and then when your customers come you just take it out of the counter out of the fridge wherever put it in a oven heat it up and hand it out to your customers and the customers can really enjoy the snack sandwich baguette whatever out of this packaging and how we are going to do this you will see now i have a baguette here that is almost 53 centimeters long i've cut that open before of course you can leave it on one piece because then you are simply faster in the preparation i take a super fine yogurt cream spread from delicant fine cost which simply gives the baguette a great taste i'll do that on it now i guess that's about 20 to 25 grams if you apply it on both sides this spread actually makes the baguette to the king and the reason why customers keep coming back i take two slices of ham that should be around 40 grams some tomato and of course cheese the cheese can also look out at the baguette because the packaging we are showing our callisto you can see here is made of baking paper and that's to the silicon coating nothing sticks at all this means that if the cheese comes out really tasty from the baguette nothing sticks to it and enjoyment on the go is guaranteed and you see here in a few seconds i've prepared three snacks here the wrapping of the baguette is completely easy if you practice like five times you'll do it much faster than i show it here we put it in the back of the pocket you can also see the perforation here which will later help the customer to enjoy the baguette on the way at home or in the construction site for example this is the same packaging process as with our hot wrap or burrito simply flip over and bend here you can see the glue points that holds everything together the glue point is so perfect that it sticks together in the oven and also in a freezer and so we have a sensationally wrapped baguette i'm now going to pack the other two baguettes as well [Music] and done three snacks produced in a very short time can be kept fresh overnight in the refrigerator and later presented in a basket at the counter for example this packaging is suitable for a high speed oven with over 270 degrees celsius as well as for any kind of panini grill due to the silicone coating on the paper and the pressure of the panini grill definitely nothing will stick on it for example three school kids come at lunch time who are hungry and want to leave quickly so of course we now have the option of putting all the three baguettes on the grill at the same time they now need about four minutes here and then come out hot crispy and tasty you can see here that the paper does not take on any color but you can also see even through the paper the delicious grill marks on the baguette we will see that just in a minute when we unpack the baguette we always recommend a high speed oven as there are now models available that also have a panini grill in the baking chamber for the grilled stripes it is estimated that it takes about one minute there while a panini grill takes about around four to five minutes so now everyone is really excited to see what it looks like we have the tear open perforation here you can see the silicone coating on the packaging you can also see that the cheese doesn't stick to it i'm just tearing around it now and we have a sensational baguette now and you can eat it anywhere while walking standing in the office and on the construction site for example we have the grill marks on the baguette above and below and a fresh product made very very easy and everyone is happy that they can a great snack near them for example in a bakery or a gas station wherever you", "GCvdpI9uANU": "get out walk in the Todd's kitchen if you want pizza but you want a very simple and different way to make it then I guarantee you all will love this recipe so join me today as I make my version of a baguette pizza okay so we're going to start off with the obvious and that is our baguette now obviously using a serrated type knife we're going to start by cutting this in half okay next we're going to place on our pizza sauce now you can make your own or just do the easy way well like I've done and just buy from the shops any favor will do it's up to you and just using the back of a spoon it's going to rub that just over it's like you're buttering the bun okay so now that our sauce base is done now it's really up to you on what type of toppings you want to use so for this side I'm going to use some shredded ham down I'm going to just add some pineapple and some chopped up mushrooms now in this one I'm going to place on some pepperoni there's some chopped up mushrooms and finally it wouldn't be a pizza without some mozzarella cheese so I'm just going to sprinkle that just on top okay so now that our two halves are done with two different flavors as I said you can choose any flavor you like now in Australia it's called a grill in America it's called a broiler now I don't to put these in the oven because the baguettes are already pretty well cooked and if you put them in the oven it's just gonna make them harder and the texture is just not that good it's just gonna be too crunchy so with the grill or the broiler on high we're gonna place this in there for about say two minutes give or take but just keep an item as soon as the cheese is melted they're ready to come out and there we have it look at that and it smells delicious so all that's left now is to carp a slice so this was an incredibly simple and easy pizza to make but let's give it a try are those so good now obviously it tastes exactly like a pizza but the massive difference is the texture of the bass and being a baguette it's tough it's chewy but it's not falling apart and it really does work fantastic so it's a simple idea but to taste the idea and it is just so different from that traditional pizza type base so by having all these pizza toppings on a baguette it truly does taste simply delicious so give it a go because it's just something that's just different but it really does work it's better than the usual boring pizza base that should usually have as a pizza so thank you for watching this episode of Todd's kitchen please check below for links to my Facebook Twitter and home handy hints channel where I put up three new home handy hints

already know the cooking channel where we guarantee 100% that all our recipes work and that is why if you are not subscribed to the channel yet, what are you waiting for, subscribe and remember to activate all the notifications of the bell so you don't miss any of our fantastic recipes every week and today play the fantastic baguette and listen to the Channel kinani crunch and here are the ingredients you will need to make the recipe as always in grams in cups and in English and we go with the recipe the first step we crumble with the help of the fingers the fresh yeast from the stops and the total amount of water that the recipe gives you we put a couple of tablespoons on it and with the help of a spoon a fork we move well until it dissolves on the other side in In a large container we put the flour that I am using a flour with 10.9% protein and then we put the water in it, we began to mix with the help of a spoon at the beginning. ipio and then with our hands we will simply move until we have completely integrated the flour into the dough and let it rest covered for 20 minutes after the resting time we will add the salt and with the help of one hand we will continue kneading until the salt is completely integrated to the dough and then we will put the yeast that we have put in it with water that we had reserved right at the beginning of the recipe and we will continue kneading simply first until we completely incorporate the water and then we will go to 2-3 minutes with the kneading technique French, as you can see, is very simple and practically the dough is called sarasola, you will see that it is ready when the dough is perfectly smooth on the surface and even a little bubbles start to come out on top   Then we will make a ball that is, we will blow up the dough and put it to rest in the same container and with a little oil to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl when we already have the oil and the spread we will put the dough right inside and leave rest for one to two hours depending on the heat you have at home in that time the dough will triple its volume perfectly and then we will dump it on the work table that we have previously floured we will divide the dough into two parts and thus we will get two baguettes it is important that you go putting a little flour especially to prevent it from sticking since the dough is quite sticky and as you can see we simply make some folds on the sides and begin to fold the dough on itself making sure that the bottom is perfectly sealed and always with the closure down here I repeat exactly the same process as you can see, it is very simple in this way we will respect the air that has been created in the sta first fermentation and get a fluffy friend I prepare the baguette at the least three times a week at home so I use these special trays that are super practical to maintain shape but if you should do as you see in the top left Rest the dough inside a well floured kitchen cloth that is exactly the same as we did in the recipe for the French bread that you have available in the channel and as you can see we will stretch the dough by rolling it on the work table until we have exactly the length of the tray we will cover with the help of a plastic or similar during the last rest this last rest will be very short of approximately 30 minutes and as you can see the dough has doubled its volume if you were doing it in the traditional way you would have to pass the bars that you have on the cloth directly on the hot tray and then give the cuts with a baker's blade or with a knife well sharpened and then very important we have to add a good amount of water on the bread for this we will use a spray and pull we will directly overcome water and now in the oven with the oven always heated and with the tray also very hot we put the bars next and it We add a good amount of water spray and for 10 minutes we bake at 235 degrees then we will lower it to 190 for 20 more minutes and look at the result of the good bread, the cows have been spectacular with a super crunchy crust and with a bread flavor freshly made simply spectacular and now all we have to do is let the baguettes cool a little on a rack, they really look good, good you don't get an idea how good it smells at home but I want you to hear the crunch * The bread crunching UwU * * Crack crock * and in addition to obtaining a very crunchy crust, look at the super fluffy and very soft crumb It is true that it is a recipe (Of course ii) well, I assure you that you will have some bars or baguettes Simply spectacular, I encourage you to prepare it at home and share the photos or videos with me, you can do it on Instagram on my Facebook or by email and at this time of the video as always I want to thank you for taking the time to watch it, if you have any questions, put a comment and I will answer any questions you may have regarding the preparation of the recipe and if you

over here okay okay i will send you to supplant okay in the middle of the road okay goodbye miss you you", "SiVHzrdGx-w": "okay so today we're gonna try and make that gets at home in front of you I have water bread flour whole wheat flour yeast salt malt powder and polish now that foolish is roughly 200 grams there's just equal parts water flour and a pinch of yeast the first thing I'm gonna do is combine all the ingredients together and put it in the stand mixing bowl without the salt what I want to do first is actually pour a little bit of water into the bowl the poolish and scrape the sides now what ends up happening it makes this much easier to release as it's easier to go into stand mixing bowl so you see us floating there you go scrape out the sides just add a little bit more water and do that once more can can see it's released okay so first we're gonna put our pool dish with water into our stand mixing bowl okay add the rest of the water yes a week long bread flour Makar in a stand mixer fitted with a hook attachment I can turn on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes until it comes a saggy mass so after 2 minutes or so you stop the machine it looks it should look something like this and we're just gonna let it sit for about half an hour so after half hour you doesn't make sure you scrape down the sides a little bit we're going to sprinkle the salt going to increase our speed to medium and then mix for 5 to 7 minutes what you want to do now is check the dough and see if it has developed enough gluten so what you want to do is basically the windowpane tests you want to stretch it I think that's pretty good you name that distress for half hour so after half an hour I just want to a series of stretch and fold submit quit my hands a little bit not pull and stretch it back on itself whole stretch back on itself whole and you're going all four directions like that and then that's it I'm gonna rest for another half hour so after half hour we repeat the same process it's just in full so when you get my hands a little bit wet and reach down pull up push pull over come all four sides this is gonna continue build strength in your dome like that that's it rest for another half hour we're gonna do two more these bolts for a series of four in total and it's gonna go to fridge to call from it between 24 hours to 72 so you can bake between those times [Music] transfer go into a stainless steel bowl wrap it it goes in the fish to coal format for 24 to 72 hours after a cold fermentation to go out of the fridge yeah unwrap it which cannot quickly the gas a little bit and then we want to divide this roughly ah so first we're gonna see how much is on here so roughly 780 grams looking up about 390 she's gonna cover it and let it sit at room temperature for 45 minutes after 45 minutes of resting and divide this into three so roughly a hundred and thirty grams each doesn't have to be exact after 45 minutes arresting and when I shape them into a rounds a little bit of flour flour on top fold in bring all the sides into the center okay here we go stop and then it's going to shape it like that so we are ready to shape our mini baguettes so what we want to do I'm just gonna dust our Baker's block generously with flour so it doesn't stick half an hour is up I'm gonna shape the baguettes this world just wanna have a little bit of flour for dusting I'm gonna flip this like so and then just over a little bit more flour as well up pat it down and stretch it after that and a full up third down now rotate it this way then throw its weight down after that you take your four fingers you're gonna curl the dough under and have your thumb underneath tucked it you're gonna Pat it down and you're gonna continue this from one side to another roll tape same motion what I'd like to do is just kind of pinch the seam as well I think it's crucial yeah and after that we're gonna roll this out just like that hold it wait oh there you go one two and three and I'm gonna put on the biggest clock and it should have seemed sites down this one doesn't have that much flour okay like so and we arrest it for 45 minutes to an hour 45 minutes is up we're gonna transfer these mini baguettes on to HT pen with a piece of parchment I have inverted the sheet pan so it's easier for us to slide through and then what we have is also a cutting board so we can actually transfer so what I want to do is gonna just release this yeah and then I want to lift up as part of this and then flip it over gently transfer it over like so again lift up it's a little bit sticky I should have put more flour on like so and then one more like this that dot and that's very it's a very wet dough so that's why it's kind of like that so you can give it a little bit of final reshaping and we in a school I'm gonna put it in the oven for 15 minutes so what we want to do now is score it and then transfer this into the oven on the baking steel or baking stone at 500 degrees we're gonna bake with this lid on for the first 5 minutes we're gonna take it off and then wait bake for another 12 to 15 minutes I have my plate here I suck at scoring and it's also weird for me to score these baguettes properly I think the baguette knows I can't score properly so", "Ed09uQhv-3k": "well good morning you guys and welcome back to the needy homesteader channel and our second video here on making bread for uh bread baking for beginners workshop today we are going to be making baguettes all right so let's get started i have you already aimed at my bowl um i will uh put the ingredients again on the screen um and so we're gonna get started here okay all right so i'm gonna kick back when i say kick back i like my hook to the back of my bowl okay and then the first thing that we're gonna add to this is going to be our yeast all right and we are gonna add one tablespoon of yeast again this is going to be the same exact recipe as what we used last week so nothing nothing new i just want you guys to be able to experience making something else that's beautiful that will impress your friends and family because i know a lot of people their families were very excited with homemade bread for the first time ever last week all right one tablespoon of sugar to that we're gonna add two cups of warm water okay we wanna wake up that yeast i say um make it as warm as a baby bottle and then to this we are going to be adding well it's going to be four to five cups of all-purpose flour okay we are going to start with four and then we will work our way up if we need to so i'm going to bring my flour bucket over here and remember you're going to level off your flower okay so fill up your one cup and then with the back of a knife and get off the excess so that you have one level don't pack it down or anything like that okay and then you're gonna go ahead and then add that to your bowl okay so i'm gonna zoom you back over here because it's just easier for you guys to see what's going on in my bowl so you can compare it to yours when you make bread because i think this is the biggest struggle for folks making bread is what it's supposed to look like and what it should feel like and again as the more you make bread the easier this will become for you you'll just know you'll see it you'll feel it you'll know when it's ready okay okay so now this is gonna be four and then i'm gonna reserve another cup off to the side and we will add it as we need it all right and now there is a certain way i talked about last week that you want to layer your ingredients into your bowl because salt can affect your yeast okay can it can actually almost kill it if you will it can prevent your bread from rising and so people that end up with really dense dead dough sometimes it can just be something as simple as putting the salt in with it and it affected the yeast so you want your yeast first then and i'm using instant okay because it's easier for beginners um you're going to lay down your your yeast your sugar then your water then you're going to lay your flour on top and as you can see we're already waking up the yeast it's getting nice and bubbly okay now to that we're gonna add our salt and we are adding two teaspoons of salt i'm using a sea salt okay but if you have table salt table salt is fine okay so two teaspoons and you see i'm laying that right on top so it's not touching the yeast at all and then we're gonna add three tablespoons of olive oil okay [Music] like i said if you want to try different ingredients you know google it i'm keeping very simple for you guys so we are not altering from this recipe at all and i would um i mean i would just strongly suggest you don't if you're new to bread baking because um every time you alter a recipe you you you can run into problems and if you have never made bread before you're not gonna know how to fix those problems or what's causing the problems it's gonna be harder for you to figure out so that is it okay a tablespoon of yeast two cups of water a tablespoon of sugar four two five we're gonna start with four cups of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of salt three tablespoons of olive oil and that's it i've lifted up my bowl and we're ready to turn on our mixer um in a kitchenaid mixer when you have the dough hook on or the kneading tool you don't ever want to knead pasta level two but read your i know that's what it is uh for the professional or the proline series i'm not sure what that is for uh the artisans um so you know check your manual just to make sure and that is the level one and that is a level two and now we're going to watch this dough come together [Applause] now what was nice about the live on sunday is that i could show you how to how long it takes and what exactly what we were looking for um and do that with you as you were making your own bread which was really it was super exciting um i loved doing the it was almost like um like a baking class it was so much fun [Applause] okay so we're just gonna watch this come together and then i'm going to grab [Applause] a little bit more flour now i never measure how much extra flour it takes you can if you want i just add flour until i know that my dough feels right it looks right and it's ready to go so we want a a dough ball that is not sticky does not come off in our hands a little bit of tacky is okay as long as it doesn't end up on your fingers and we want a clean mixing bowl okay it's not going to come out perfectly clean but when we mean clean we mean not a bunch of poop on the sides so as you see it's coming together but it is still sticky so i'm going to go ahead and i'm just gonna tap in and i do like you know a tablespoon or two tablespoons at a time okay if you use a little poppy uh measurer you can pick this up for like a dollar at walmart um this will prevent you from adding too much flour because if you add too much flour you're gonna have a really dense and tough bread dough okay so what i would suggest is if you want to really start making bread and learn about it um get yourself a really good bread baking book i have videos on my favorite bread baking books i will leave a link up above to uh that video and um or go to the library and pull some books on bread and uh really learn about the science it's you know it's like canning there is a science behind it so we're just going to tap in a little bit of flour as i see that it's still sticky on the bottom [Applause] now my kitchen is quite cold because i think we're at like a negative 10 this morning [Applause] up here in northern lower michigan [Applause] and there it's starting to really look good now [Applause] what i'm looking for is again this dough to come off of the bottom and stop sticking but if you see i touch it and it's coming off in my hands so it's still too sticky so we're gonna need to add a bit more flour [Applause] okay [Applause] okay now i'm going to stop right here because this has happened to many of you when you're kneading it it will break apart like that and all of a sudden it'll go from a dough ball to being soft again that's okay that's just telling you that you need more flour okay so we're gonna just sprinkle in another two tablespoons remember you can take an extra cup if you need an extra cup it's going to take an extra cup if you have a warm kitchen it might need more than a cup just do little bits at a time so you don't overwhelm your dough and you don't have too much and end up with a really tough dough and i promise you the more you do this the easier it will become to just keep making those loaves of bread [Applause] give them out to your neighbors i used to send my boys friends when they would come and hang out the house i would send bread home to their to their parents for dinner a nice loaf of bread that way i could make more bread the next day and i just made bread every day you guys when i first started learning how to make bread just keep adding little bits until you start seeing that dough ball come back together [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] okay so now you can see how that dough has come together now the knocking that you hear from my mixer is because i have a an all metal gear mixer if you have a proline seven uh and your mixer knocks it's totally normal i tried i called kitchenaid to make sure and they're like yes that's exactly what it should do now mine's just a little bit still sticky because i can feel it sticking to my fingers so i'm just going to sprinkle in just a little bit more but you see how that's come together now the dough is starting to clean up a little bit [Applause] the ball the bowl is coming clean and i'm just going to sprinkle in another about a tablespoon of dough i'm going to shut it off and then i'm going to feel it and that feels really good so slightly tacky okay it's okay if it sticks a little bit to your hand but it's not coming off in my hand i can touch it and my hands are clean so that tells me my dough is ready to go now there is a windowpane test that you can do uh with dough i don't ever do that um but you can look into that if you want to do that and now i'm gonna set my timer okay so it's at this point that i go ahead and set my timer for five minutes you might need seven minutes to uh knead your dough um and then i'm gonna let this knead for five minutes and then i'm gonna come back and we're gonna get it out of the bowl at this point if it is no longer sticky okay it's not sticking on your hand at this point your dough ball should not break apart it should not get back so soft if it does it just means it needs a little bit more flour and it just wasn't ready okay but at this point for me my dough should be absolutely fine i shouldn't have to add anything to it at this point so i'm going to let this knead at a level two for five minutes and i'll bring you back when the system [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] all right you guys our dough is done so i'm going to scooch it back here and i'm going to show you what i do here okay so i got some flour on my counter you always want to make sure your counter uh wipe down your counter soap you know hot soapy water and all of that and then i give it a quick wipe down um you know just to get the flour off of the hot rag you don't want to use any soap at this point you just want to make sure that your counters are already clean because you don't want any soap residue that you might have forgotten or not been able to get up you can also dry your counter if you want um i do you just want to make sure that the surface that you're working on is super clean all right and then we're going to take this dough out of here i'm going to take off my wedding ring here and i'm going to take off the dough hook okay just take off that i throw that in the sink wash it and then you want a dough scraper i will leave you a link down below to my ghost scraper i love this one because it's got several different sides and shapes that i can use for my bread from cutting it to scraping it to dividing it this is from a kitchenaid it's a little kitchenaid one and i am loving it it's pretty new to me and i've been obsessed so you can just go into your bowl like that and scrape out your dough ball okay and your bowl should look relatively clean so it's not gonna be when i say clean i mean sometimes mine looks perfectly clean it all depends on the day and the dough um but this is clean okay that means no chunks it's not you know a lot of it's not stuck to the bottom it's a nice dough ball so what we're gonna do with this is we are going to take our olive oil all right there we go and we're just going to put we're just going to drizzle a little in there okay a tablespoon or so and that's going to prevent our dough from sticking to the bowl when we put it in there now here's our dough ball okay hopefully you guys can see that you see if i can't aim you down a little bit there we go okay again make sure your hands are perfectly clean and now you're just gonna hand knead this a little bit into a ball okay oh i miss hand kneading so much my hands just can't um just can't tolerate it so but the little bit that i get to knead oh the dough just feels so good okay so now on the bottom what i do is i pull and pinch the bottom okay and then i flip my ball over all right and then i just tuck and as you're tucking you're kind of pulling and stretching the top of the bread so it's nice well the dough i should say so it's nice and smooth okay and so that you have a nice beautiful dough ball okay and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and upside down we're gonna put our dough ball in all right we're gonna give it a spin in the olive oil and flip it over and now it's nice and coated in olive oil the bottom will have some olive oil on it and this won't stick as it rises okay what i do is i take a flower sack towel and i run run it under really hot water wring it out really well so it's not so you know just softly wet and then i cover my dough ball and then what i do is i put my cause i've gotten this question so my handle is in the back okay so in the front i drape okay i pull and then and then i'm going to spin it around towards my handle which is hiding right here towards my handle i take the excess and i tuck it into the handle and then this way um it's you know you don't have a lot of excess um towel you know you might have a little bit but you can tuck that under and i put this in my stove in my oven i should say in my oven uh with the light on okay the light on in your oven will give it just enough heat to help this rise okay now i have a proof setting on my oven it's one of the reasons why i got my oven so um the proof setting for me is perfect so i just set it to proof i also put my light on and i tucked this in the back of the stove next to the light and we're going to let this rise for 30 minutes mine is going to go in the oven now and i will see you guys back here in 30 minutes all right you guys so here we go so here's our bowl it's been 30 minutes now i'm gonna go ahead and change my um my oven to preheat to 425 all right and so that can heat up while we get our dough shaped so here we have it all right it's risen beautifully it's doubled in size really clean hands we're going to go ahead and deflate this like so and then we're just going to get so now you can use a rolling pin at this point if you want i never do i just use my hands and i'm going to shape this to the shape of like a nice rectangle because we are going to divide this dough now remember this is the same dough as the the italian bread we are going to shape this into three different loaves so i just stretch it out make sure it's kind of even like i said you can use a rolling pin if you prefer you can also weigh your dough if you want perfectly shaped baguettes but you know what i'm just a mom and i don't it's just not that deep for me so we're just gonna do some beautiful baguettes for dinner tonight i'm making breaded pork chops with uh some groton potatoes and some steamed vegetables and serving it with a nice baguette and some butter it's gonna be amazing um it's also good dipped in olive oil with a little salt and pepper tons of ways that you can serve these baguettes okay so here we have it let me spin you around here and show you and now we are going to cut it so this is where a bench knife comes in handy um my uh my uh scraper is in the wash but you can use your scraper your scraper will have if you buy a scraper this is a really inexpensive one that you can get on amazon i'll try to leave a link down below um i have a link for bread baking over on my amazon storefront that lists everything that i use for bread baking but you would use this flat side right here um or you can use a bench scraper whichever one you prefer we'll use the less expensive one because this is probably the one that most of you will have right if you're starting out if you don't have anything a pizza slice oh let's use that because most people have a pizza slicer right so you can use a pizza slicer all right uh you can use a knife whatever you have so what we're gonna do is now we're gonna cut this into thirds okay and like i said it doesn't have to be perfect um okay you just want to cut it in thirds all right and then what we're gonna do is we are gonna start rolling this up okay i always start with the edge okay and you're just gonna lift it and roll okay there's one okay lift and roll and then lift and roll all right and then you have three nice three nice baguettes now if you wanted to make a loaf of bread you could braid this and it could be bread you could also cut these up and shape them and they could be dinner rolls but we are going we're gonna do baguettes all right so what i do now is i'm gonna move these over and so what i do is you want uh the bottom part where the seam is gonna be okay so you're going to just pinch that seam into the dough and the seam side is going to be our bottom okay and then this is going to help us not have that bread explode out of the side okay so there's our seam we're gonna roll it down and then you're just kind of gonna press it down lightly and roll that out and so what that does is that will kind of smooth out that seam a bit okay if it needs to be pinched a little bit more just pinch it a little bit more okay and then roll it all right and then there is one okay we're gonna set that off to the side let's do our second one here we're gonna pinch the seam and then press it out if you do not have a baguette pan you can just go ahead and use a cookie sheet this however is a baguette pan um you can buy it by itself in a single pan like this with four you can buy it in two you can even buy it with two pans so i bought a double pack uh i got it on a lightning sale for 10.99 for two but they run usually about 20 for two i will leave the link down below to the one that i own i have it in black it also comes in golden and silver it doesn't matter what color you get they all work the same in my opinion um but that's what a baguette pan it looks like and what's nice about it is that it keeps the shape of the baguettes now this is a pan that i wanted for a long time i just never splurged to buy it and i now regret that i didn't buy it sooner because i have been making baguettes every week i'm gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna put our baguette right onto the pan okay and this is where i'm gonna tuck the ends of the dough in to make them look nice and pretty okay and then you're just going to shape them out so that you know one side isn't fatter than the other just squeeze and play with your dough until you get it the way you want it to look that your baguette you know tuck the ends in so nice and pretty so we want our seam side there's our seam you see right there you want our the seam down in the center okay and then we are going to vent this bread by putting lines in it i find that for baguettes five lines is the best five cuts i'm using a bread lane but you can use um a steak knife or a serrated knife to do it so what i like to do is i like to put one cut in the center and then two in front two in back you don't want to cut all the way through the bread you just want to cut the tops i want to say probably [Music] maybe a quarter of an inch you just want to make sure that you are venting that bread so that it can bake nice and even all right let's get an egg okay so here is our egg and we're just gonna add about a teaspoon of water in there these beautiful baguettes a nice little egg wash all right so first thing i'm going to add um is i've got some pretzel salt here so on one of these i'm going to just make a salted one the kids really love the salted ones one the second one i'm gonna do is an everything bagel seasoning my family also loves this one this one i'm going to do the minced garlic this is how i get it i buy mine from my my mennonite uh bulk food store so i'm just gonna sprinkle some minced roasted garlic on here the church brunch or anything like that you know could bring the baguettes now to that one i'm gonna add just a little bit of the pretzel salt just to go with the garlic just offsets it really well and a whole lot all right so here we go so there is our pretzel salt our everything bagel and our roasted garlic and pretzel salt now this is going to go in a 425 degree oven uh for about 20-25 minutes for me it's about 25 minutes keep an eye on it you want to make sure that they're golden brown if they're still light on the edges like if they're a little golden brown on the top but white on the edges i always leave it in for an extra five minutes until the whole thing is nice and golden brown you don't want to burn it though so keep an eye on it okay so 425 for 20 to 25 minutes 30 minutes if your oven you know it doesn't bake as hot um until they come out and they will sound nice and hollow i'll i'll show you how they should sound and uh and then there they are in the oven now i'm gonna set the timer for 10 minutes and in 10 minutes i'm just gonna flip that around um just so that they bake nice and even in my oven and then i'll let them finish baking for another 15 minutes there we have it so this is the salt the everything and then the garlic with the salt i'll just pan you over there so you can see it and then i'm just gonna put it right on this rack and i'm gonna let them cool before you slice into them remember you don't want to slice into bread when it's super hot because the steam is the moisture so what will happen to your bread is if you cut into it while it's still hot it will become very dry and so we don't want that so it's okay to cut into it if it's still a little warm as long as you can touch it and it doesn't burn your hand or anything you can cut into it warm if you're gonna serve it right away but otherwise you want bread to let it completely cool that way it holds in the moisture content and then the inside of your bread will be nice and soft okay and that's what you want you want a nice hollow sound now there's the underneath of it where our seam is and as you can see uh nothing blew out and that's because we put put the seam on the bottom and we made those slits in the bread so they've been able to bake evenly and um and not implode and explode out the side so i know that's a common problem um i know it's a problem that i dealt with so i figured i would talk about it so i'm gonna space those out so they can kind of cool all right you guys so showers are done everybody's up eating breakfast now and we're ready to slice into this i'm gonna slice into the salted one because the kids are gonna want to taste it and they love it they love this one so there it is you should hear a nice hollow sound when your bread is done and now i'm going to cut into this i like to slice these on the side you can put them straight on if you want and i will show you the inside there you go look at how beautiful that is right and there is the bread now matt tell everybody what you did with these yesterday for lunch was it yesterday the day before um i can't remember oh no it's the day before that was the day before so we're gonna slice these something in here i um that's how crunchy that is it's a nice crunch crusty uh crust and inside super soft i used a five cheese italian blend and two different types of pesto a pesto with sun dried tomato and then a traditional pesto uh with just the basil and i think in olive oil and i mixed um the individual pestos with some of the italian cheese and then i spread it across the bread and then i baked them in the oven and made a pesto bread oh it was so good that's what we had for lunch right so there you have it so i'm gonna give a slice off to matt and he's gonna slap some butter on it but these are beautiful you guys are gonna love these so that is it you guys i hope that was helpful and this loaf is gonna be gone within 10 minutes alright you guys i hope you enjoyed this video as i eat my little slice of bread i hope you give it a try i'm so proud of all of you and i'm so excited to be even just a little part of your bread journey i'll be seeing you next week next week we are going to switch gears a little bit we're going to get a little more complicated and we are going to make a really really soft bread loaf all right so i'll see you then and you guys take care bye guys", "l3JYvZnRA-w": "my name is all I open this bakery almost three years ago in October 2013 now we have more and more American customers who have discovered what French bread is we produce between 300 and 800 baguettes a day especially during the weekend it's completely huge we have plenty of people are trying to to enter the store a baguette is specific for two main reasons first we are making our own Soto and second we have a process very unique called the cold dough process this is very specific and even in France only 3% of the bakers master this process we bring the cold dough shaped as a baguette on the stone of this oven so the the dough is naturally rising on this stone during the seven first minutes of the baking time of the baguettes another advantage of this process is that we bake all over the day so the customers always have a fresh baguette that has been back for less than two hours", "wn1_FHPND7M": "Baguette in the

going to be making some baguettes and the recipe that we're going to be using for the baguettes is very simple fun and easy to use it only takes about five minutes to prepare then the recipe was was really created for a bread machine bread machine similar to this you can use any bread machine that you have basically what we use it for is the kneading process because the kneading process you know takes a lot of time this makes it so much simpler to use and it saves you a lot of time okay well first of all we need a recipe and here's the recipe right here and you can pause your video if you need to to write it down and so next let's go ahead and get the ingredients and have some fun in here what we're going to need is a cup and we're going to have 2 cups of water so let me just set that right there we'll get some utensils I just use a cup a teaspoon and a tablespoon and some flour and this is bread flour I don't use all-purpose flour all-purpose flour makes you bag it's heavy and almost like a brick so you want to use real good bread flour so we're going to need 2 cups of water and that looks like it's about right let's see yeah that looks good while that's sitting down we get the yeast I've got let's see where's the yeast here it is I use rapid rise yeast it only takes 45 minutes to knead and I'd buy it bulk at Winco so my water has settled it's perfecto for the buckets so I've got my yeast I've got my water I've got my flour the next thing we need is some salt so I've got my salt my sugar I saw them all down there and now we're ready to make the dough okay okay we put all the ingredients is in now let's just move it over to the bread machine sit in the bread machine put the lid down set it and we're ready to go and 45 minutes we'll be back okay while the dough was rising I wish my dough in the banquet rise was just sitting there at nothing though but while the dough is rising what we want to do is get some cornmeal and we're going to lay the respect of the cornmeal out here so that we can lay it in our dough and also an egg yolk just an egg yolk without the white I have filtered the what the white out of it and I'm going to add a tablespoon of water and that's about it yeah that's about a tablespoon right there maybe tablespoon and a half again this is not scientific and I'm just going to whisk that up and I'm going to use that to base by my bag at the top of the baguettes okay so here we go we're going to sprinkle a little cornmeal on the countertop okay okay here we go we're going to dump this out and we're gonna get it out here on the countertop kind of just slides out because of the olive oil that we put in there and by the way I like to use olive oil because it makes my baguettes soft I don't like the hard crunchy crusts but if you do don't use olive oil and the egg the egg also the egg yolk also softens the the crust okay so here we have our our go again just kind of roll it up a little bit like that hey there we go and what we're going to do is cut this baby in half now I know you should use this scale I bought a scale like trying scale but now we got it home and it didn't work so we took it back and we haven't buy the scale sense so the baguettes that our baguettes don't come out exactly even but I mean we just kind of eye it and that looks like like about the middle so cut that baby right in half and I've got one kind of setting up there and I just kind of squish it together a little bit okay now now I want to fold it over toward me and then back and then kind of punch it down a little bit same with this one I'm going to Pat it out a little bit fold it over fold it back punch it down a little bit and let it sit there Kevin's gonna let these sit here for about five or ten minutes and then we're going to shape them okay we'll see you in five or ten minutes okay here they are it's been about ten minutes and they're looking pretty good they're starting to bubble up you see the bubbles there that's the indication that it's it's ready to ready to be needed the last time is very simple full is really not needing it but here we go now the key is is to get your thumb in the side and pull back see how I'm kind of pinching back I used my palm of my hand to push down on it just kind of easy and you can see I'm pushing in folding over pushing in folding over and using the palm to close the seam then I'm going to do that three times one - now on the third time I'm going to really whack it with the poem you really close that seam up kind of hurt a couple of pops there from me from the air inside okay there now we have our seal and now I'm just going to roll it a little bit I roll it from the from the middle out this guy is a little big on this end so I'm going to work this in a little bit and that's actually about as long as I want them that's about it right there okay now I'm going to do the same with the other and I'll get back to you in just a minute now we're going to cut our baguettes to allow the air and the gases to come out as it bakes so I'm going to do one lengthwise just like that just slice it right down the middle you want to get a nice don't don't be afraid about getting too deep because you want all that air to come out you see that open that open it up this one we're going to do a little bit different let's go ahead and cut it this way diagonal cuts oh there's the magic sound let's take a look Wow primo here we go let's take these baby Baggett's out of here here we go look at that right from the French bakery Wow there we are from Jerry's kitchen to yours happy eating see you soon", "oegoQPDnGCg": "don't waste that heat man listen to that crust yo what's going on fam so happy to be here today with you my name is brian ford also known as ours and brian uni ambassador always represented today we're going to make sourdough baguettes in the uni pro all right but before we get outside because it's too hot out there i'm going to mix the dough in my kitchen and i'm going to show you how you can make a really simple sourdough baguette recipe for the unipro bake all right guys so here i've got 300 grams of water and 100 grams of my lavang also known as sourdough starter i'm going to dissolve that into the water and then here i've got 500 grams of flour so we're going to just mix it together like this all right guys after 30 minutes see our dough is spread a little bit it's already starting to gain some strength so we're going to take 10 grams of salt and i've got 75 extra grams of water that i want to add to the dough all right i'm going to start off kind of slow i'm going to add the rest of our water get in there and squeeze it and do this method slapping the dough to develop it as well once you see the dough is breaking apart a little bit you want to stop all right guys after a five minute rest i'm gonna check our dough see that it's already gaining some strength this is in a clean bowl what we're going to want to do is let it rest for 30 minutes and then we're going to give it some stretches and folds all right guys so every 30 minutes for an hour and a half you're going to stretch and fold your dough lift your dough up from each corner and fold it into the middle make sure that you follow the recipe that's on uni.com all right what we can do with this dough after the stretching folds you can let the bulk fermentation go for four hours and then put it into the fridge for 12 hours and then take it out to shape or you can let the bulk fermentation go eight hours at room temperature and then shake yo what's going on y'all it's time to shape these baguettes man it's the moment that i crave to exist in this baguette shaping so first things first we're going to flour our work surface and then we'll just kind of scoop it out you see the bubbles very nicely fermented all right guys next up is the shaping kind of create a little triangle grab this front tip and push in to the baguette then use your thumbs at the end and then nice and easy boom you got a beautiful baguette shape there for proofing we're gonna take some semolina onto the cutting board and we'll put them seam side down you could put a little semolina on the top a little flour a little more semolina a little more flour i'm just playing cover them up let these guys proof for two to three hours all right fam it's time to bake the baguettes so check it out look thermometer uh on the door is saying that we're around 500 fahrenheit that is the point where i want to load the baguettes all right and there's not much of a flame going on inside if there's too big of a flame it's going to burn your bread it's going to burn your baguettes you don't want to burn the baguettes key to loading the baguettes into the unipro get some parchment with some semolina on your peel transfer straighten it back up that's why your shaping is very important then we're going to slash the baguettes three times one two three beautiful and then we're just gonna simply load check them out oh yeah they're looking nice and thick for sure been letting these bad guys rock for a couple minutes ah lee they're coming out nice man look at that color our bottoms looking good too look at that that's not bad at all it's a beautiful sourdough baguette thank you guys for watching make sure that you're like and subscribe to the channel make sure that you guys are checking out uni.com for all the recipes try these recipes out guys if you're outside in your backyard you got a hot oven you got a great quality stone in there don't waste that heat man listen to that crust hey it's your boy arson brian i'll let you boy [Music]", "vX7Ez9hSgD4": "[Music] i never thought this day would happen i never thought i'd be showing you how to make amazing gluten-free baguettes i never thought i'd probably eat a nice baguette again because it's one of the things i've missed so much being gluten-free like as a kid i loved baguettes crusty outside soft middle and that's pretty much what i'm gonna show you today but they're gluten-free so that we can eat them like they're really simple to make and i don't know i just thought that they wouldn't be but a lot of practice has gone into this and i'm honestly super super happy with the recipe as i said really simple ingredients and you do get that really nice crusty outside with a soft middle you can cut it up and i mean you can make like a sandwich with it you can just cut it up into little bits and spread some butter on it like whatever you do with the baguette you can do with this because this is just like a regular baguette but it's gluten free like how good is that you can put sesame seeds on top poppy seeds you can do it like cover it with cheese whatever you want one thing i will say you do need one bit of equipment for this you need a baguette tray thing whatever this is called um but these are really simple to find i just bought mine in a supermarket you can buy them online very affordable very good value and very essential don't try and do it without it buy one of these um but yeah the full recipe for this is in my book which i will link below so you can read along follow along but i thought that just making this video would be really really handy because it just shows you the steps properly so that's why i did it so let's get on with showing you the ingredients and then we can make our baguettes okay so i told you ingredients wise very very simple very sort of whitey beigey colors but everything is very accessible so let's start here this is this is actually gluten-free bread flour but you can use gluten-free plain slash all-purpose flour whatever you can get your hands on will be fine for this i've got some egg whites here um i've measured them out sort of them out already you can use the don't get rid of egg yolks you can use them for something else i've got warm water here this is warm i always say this but when you feel it it shouldn't be boiling it shouldn't be cold it should kind of just be pleasant as it were i've got some caster sugar here i have got some xanthan gum here which is pretty important for this as is the psyllium husk the one ingredient that people are always like oh i can't always find that you can and you can buy it super super cheaply and i promise you it is what makes these amazing and it's what makes so many of my bread recipes really really good because it gives it the gluten factor which is what we want um i've got some cider vinegar here in my little shot glass um nice shot though just a small amount of cider vinegar i have also got some salt here and i've got a little bit of melted butter and then the final ingredient i've got is yeast which obviously is very important for baking bread um this is dried active yeast so it needs to be activated which is why i've got my sugar and my warm water and also just to say make sure that your yeast is definitely gluten free yeast as an ingredient obviously is but things can be added to yeast this is completely fine um so this one i would recommend but yeah that's literally all the ingredients except i have forgotten to get some seeds out which i will be putting on top of mine um yes you could get sesame seeds or poppy seeds or whatever you wanted but these are all the main core ingredients that you will need alongside your baguette tin and i will be using a stand mixer but you can use an electric hand whisk as well for this um so yeah that's all you need let's get on with baking some baguettes okay so first things first i've got my warm water and i'm just going to add to it my sugar and my yeast and then i'll mix that together and leave it for about 10 minutes until it gets nice and frothy remember that if it doesn't go frothy then you shouldn't be continuing if it doesn't go frothy there could be a number of reasons for that you might be using the wrong type of yeast your yeast might be out of date or something or a bit old um but make sure that it's really nice and frothy and i'll show you what i mean in about 10 minutes time okay so whilst i'm waiting for the yeast i'm going to put all my dry ingredients into here so my gluten-free flour my psyllium husk my xanthum gum and my salt i'm going to mix them all together and then by the time that's done i think almost 10 minutes will be up and we'll be able to put in all the wet ingredients including that frothy frothy yeast whoa oh that looks really good really yeasty really frothed up it's increased in size so i'm going to pour this in as well as my butter my vinegar and my egg whites and then i'll mix it all together briefly before i put it into the stand mixer to go on a proper proper like mix mix mix [Music] right so this is ready to mix now and i am going to mix it for between three to five minutes until it's all really nice and combined it almost seems like a not elasticy is that a word elasticy i don't know um but pretty much like a really sticky kind of dough you'll know when it's done because it shouldn't look like this and i'll show you what it should look like in about three to five minutes okay so it's been about five minutes and it's all mixed and it's become a nice sort of really sort of sticky dough you can see on my fingers sticky um so we're going to leave this just to sit in the bowl just like this for about 10 minutes um and that just helps for the liquid and the water and all the stuff that's in it that's liquid to hydrate all those dry ingredients and so we're going to leave that just for a short while and then after that it's very very simple we're going to start putting the mixture into our baguette tins so that it can prove and then it's time to cook so this has been sitting here for about 10 minutes now and you can see that it's a lot less sticky on the hands before it was sticking everywhere now my hands are fairly clean so what i'm gonna do now is i'm going to portion it out between the two baguette tins or the baguette tin with the two bits in it so yeah basically we're just gonna spoon some into here and some into there but then what we need to do because it will be sticky once you start moving it is that we need to smooth it over because we're going to leave it to prove and however it looks at this point is how it's going to sort of look once it's proven and then that's going to be how it looks once it's cooked so we want them to be fairly smooth looking just like a regular baguette not some weird weird contraption thing that isn't like a proper proper baguette we want the proper thing here so i'll spoon it in so you can see how i'm doing it it is a bit sticky so what i tend to do is that if i'm using my fingers or a palette knife i get myself a little bit of water like so and then i can dip my fingers in it and that really helps to just sort of keep the stickiness obviously you don't want tons of water on it but just a little bit just to help you sort of shape it into the form that you want it so i'm going to do that now and i'll show you of course along the way okay so i've got all my mixture into here now but now i need to shape it you don't want bits that are like sort of here it looks quite thin compared to this bit we want to make it all so it's nice and even also in my crazed madness and excitement of making these i forgot to tell you about how i prepare the tin so with the tin i just sort of spread um i use a little bit of kitchen roll and just wipe some butter into it just to sort of grease it so you can just do anything you'd normally do to grease it and then also something i completely forgot to do is i like to sprinkle the base of my tins with either sesame or poppy so what i was gonna do is before i put this mixture in i was going to sprinkle the tin this one with sesame this one with poppy and then what i'll do is i'll be putting it over the top as well so you'll just have to imagine that and when you do it yourself definitely do it because it's really nice to have the seeds on the top and the bottom um but obviously i'm just a bit forgetful and forgot but what i'm going to do now is just smooth them out make them nice and even so there's not these big wide bits here and thin bits there as i said i'm going to be using my fingers with some water but also i've got my trusty my trusty palette knife which i use for everything so yeah watching what should learn i [Music] guess okay so these are nicely smooth now as smooth as i mean you could do it for longer if you wanted to to make them even smoother but around this is what i would say is okay and as you can see like throughout because my hands were wet didn't get sticky hands and the palette knife remained non-sticky as well so that's kind of what you're aiming for now you don't then put your seeds on at this point what i tend to do is i just cover it with cling film and i'm gonna let it proof for around 45 minutes obviously this timing will vary depending on the temperature so if you were going to put it into your oven on a really really low temperature like i'm thinking 30 degrees c or less but that's nice and warm then it will probably take around 40 to 45 minutes if you're not gonna do that and you're just going to put it somewhere isn't as warm as that it might take up to an hour um i'm actually not going to put it into my oven like i usually do today because it is so hot outside that i'm just going to leave it covered in cling film here and hopefully in around 45 minutes it should be all proved ready for me to sprinkle on my seeds try and remind me to do that um and then i'll be able to bake in the oven [Music] okay so here they are they have risen lovely i'm very impressed i'm very happy with this so i'm going to remove the cling film now and then i'm going to sprinkle with my seeds that i've remembered this time i decided to do one with sesame one with poppy and then i will be doing some slashes just with a sharp knife across like this and then they'll be ready for the oven now the oven i have preheated it's on 200 degrees c um fan so that's 220 degrees c which is 400 degrees fahrenheit i believe um and also i've boiled a kettle because in the base of the oven there is going to be some water to help with the steam um i don't know i'm doing these hand movements um so yeah i'll do that now well i'll show you what i'm doing anyway whatever okay so these are ready to go in the oven these are going to go in for 40 minutes in total 20 minutes at that original 200 degree c fan temperature and then we're going to reduce it to 160 degrees c fan for the last 20 minutes so 20 at 200 21.60 and that's just because we're sort of crisping up at the beginning and then cooking it through and if you put it on 200 for the whole time they will probably go a bit too brown saying that if when you look into the oven after 30 minutes of the 40 they look to be going a little bit browner than you'd like to all you have to do is get a little bit of foil and shiny side up put it over the bread quite loosely not too tight and that will just mean they can cook without the tops browning anymore but i'm now going to put these into the oven and put my timer on and also very importantly pour a load of boiling water into the base of the oven so that it has that nice steaming effect [Music] so they are out of the oven there we go don't they just look amazing look lovely nice crispy crusty exterior and obviously you just have to trust me for now the interior or the center whatever the middle is lovely and soft so i'm gonna leave these obviously just like with with all breads especially gluten-free breads it continues to cook it continues to cook until it's completely cool so you cannot eat it until this is cold honestly it makes such a difference um to the texture and everything but what i'm going to do is i'm going to leave this for just like literally a couple of minutes in this tin and then i'm going to remove both of them and put them onto a cooling rack to fully cool because if you leave it in something that isn't that's a bit more filled in um i find that bread will go soggy so you need to get it off here onto a cooling rack to fully fully cool and obviously it will cool quick obviously it will cool quicker as well which is very handy but yeah these will be ready to enjoy fairly soon [Music] this gluten-free baguette is so soft and the crust is just so epic honestly no one on this earth would know it's gluten-free just like my gluten-free sandwich loaf which you can click up here to watch a video of how i make it and also you can click up here to watch me make gluten-free brioche burger buns and i will see you in the next video bye", "iOuxBdXGE9M": "[Music] so [Music] so

everyone from RITA and welcome to my youtube channel RITA CHEF CHANNEL. Today we prepare together the  mini baguettes , a fantastic French bread, light and crunchy. Let's go to the kitchen .... Let's see the ingredients: bread flour , a pinch of salt, very little fresh yeast and water. The quantities are written in the infobox. I put a little water already weighed into the bowl of yeast and let it melt. Now pour the yeast and water into the flour bowl. Baguettes must have a high rate of hydration. I begin to knead and finally add the salt. We thus knead with the wooden spoon for three or four minutes. The dough is sticky hydrated, you see? Now we cover it at a constant temperature of 24 \u00b0 and let it rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes with a spatula that I dip in water or with the wet mono, I will make creases. In this way it is more than enough so I cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for another 45 minutes. 45 minutes have passed, I deflate the dough and then I begin to fold c Now I cover again with the film and let it rest for 45 minutes. We have reached the end of the third 45-minute leavening. At this point with the flour we dust the work surface, put the dough, and begin to make folds. It is a wonderful dough ... Now I stretch it along and form some loaves, with which I will then form the mini baguettes. At this point we are going to make some cuts to our dough, and each cut will correspond to a mini baguette. so let's start stretching, folding, stretching again, and folding , you see? I sprinkle a little flour on the counter and put my dough on one side, and repeat the same thing for everyone else. These are blocks of 110 grams each. now some more flour on the surface and then I cover them with a soft cloth and leave them for 20 minutes. Our loaves have grown, now we form the baguettes. Here is my mini baguette ready, then place them on the cloth dusted with flour, and continue .... Between one mini baguette and the other I slightly raised the napkin to separate them. Now we can cover and let them rise for the last 20 minutes, in the meantime I will go to preheat my oven to 220 degrees and I will put this pan at the base of the oven with a little water inside. We are ready to put the baguettes on the pan, a little spaced. Now I brush the baguettes with water, before baking I make cuts ... so almost vertically so and we are ready to bake. My oven is preheated to 220 degrees but when I bake my baguettes I will lower the temperature to 200 degrees and I will let the baguettes cook with the pan of water inside for about 20/25 minutes until golden brown. Here are my freshly baked baguettes ... now I let them cool I want you to feel the crunchiness, they are light, crunchy, scented really very very pretty so small.

beginning just just watch out what do you mean just the beginning i i believe i hear something you don't know what you're doing bro is that big shark kelani here 17 years bro i know all right just give me that one time one time try it one time for what you guys just maybe you're going to like that sound i promise you won't try hard i'm not going to like it bro i i already know which one i'm doing bro okay maybe i'll copy you copy me come on bro let me just show you just this one [Music] welcome back to fresher dave and coming to you live from kelani jewelry toronto max in the heart of toronto where we bring you and show you the freshest the crispiest the hottest pieces to ever come out of this complex and we're bringing you the hottest lady out of kilani jewelry today nor clement you know you always have to be special when you come to kalani jewelry and the fresh of the oven show right i actually feel special and honored to be here with you today you've been working with us for almost 10 years today you asked for your ten years ten yes definitely definitely she would never go anywhere now i want you guys to recognize her dressed up with her blue sky dweller fully bust down ladies it's all about you now all the ladies wants to be feeling the same feeling everyone else have on the wrist this bus down sky dweller is insane and for you ladies you must consider busting down your watches because we got you so much crispy watches in here i was just gonna tell you i'm feeling crispy hot spicy all of the above with this now today we going to educate you guys a little bit i want to get into this little education really fast many people don't know the four c's the four c's the grades of the diamonds many times we keep talking vbs def excellent cut a lot of people don't know and why i'm bringing you this today is because a friend or a client that reached out from vancouver first time client ended up buying uh toronto max cuban rose gold and ended up buying a wash too and he sent me a piece that was custom made for him he wanted to make sure that the bail on this pendant fits on the chain once i receive this pendant the engraving in the back it's completely hollow so it's big it makes that christmas jingle bell music once you put it on or touch any jewelry with it and the quality said vs plus and on the engraving of this plane from this company so to verify and certify the piece is vs plus looking at that piece this piece was garbage it had high quality s i and v as everything in my does they mean vs minus basically so why i'm talking like this is because really and honestly the consumers the clients and the people that actually walk into kalani jury even when they have so much jewelry on 70 to 80 i even said yesterday 60 said no it's even closer to 80 people don't know what they got on there they don't have the knowledge and it's our responsibility to do this for you because we want you to know the reality you want to make sure you know where your money is going so don't look for cheap look for quality let's get into the four c's the first things that we have to do in here is colors now the word diamond it starts with the letter d diamond abc the alphabet we take the a b c o d e f would be the first group of colors def which is this one e and f d f consider colorless colors and this what we deal with completely yes and absolute nothing less than this now what's available in the market everybody tells you g h g h g h v s remember these words i'm saying it repeatedly because i know for a fact most of the jeweler used the word vs gh why is because gh is near to colorness gh is actually a beautiful stone too but it is more clear to the ears and to the mind of the humans to recognize that gh is more colorless okay i'll buy it but when you look at these pieces and really grade them they are a lot lower than g h i so d e f is the first group g h i is the second group j k l m n o you go down the colors you see it here goes in yellow whatever i seen in this pendant that came to me and from vancouver it was around m and o color this is cheap now when we come down to the clarities clearly this is the most important aspect in here now when i tell you guys you don't know nothing it is today for you to recognize and understand something from us the clarity here it starts with i quality and it has three groups it means included which is it has so much inclusions in the diamond that are visible to the eye to the naked eye yes s i which is this si2 lower than si1 that means it's slightly included which is slightly you can see it with the naked eye if the dots or the the kerbin or whatever inclusion is on the table but if it's in the bottom of the diamond so it's not going to be so visible to the naked eye unless it's a black dot yes which is black curving after the si you go into the vs1 vs2 ps2 is lower than vs1 vs very slightly included it's very good in amazing stone yeah vvs very very slightly included there's vbs2 vbs1 and vbs plus which it is it goes into interior flawless and flawless that's for bigger stones now kalani jewelry only uses vbs plus yes and i want to mention when you're talking about these all these gratings are actually made through a 10 time microscope so to the naked eye when you say vvs if it's very very slightly included under the microscope you can just imagine the fire and the sparkle and the cleansiness of the stone that you're gonna get with vvs okay now when it goes down to the cuts of the diamond there's pore there's fear there's good there's very good and there's excellent ideal alkalinity jewelry deal with excellent now you can always have a vvs de color stone but it's very poor in cut or very fair and cut now the 4c is the carrots and the weights of the diamonds let me take this away guys i brought you diamonds i brought you samples to see what we actually going to talk to you about these are stones about 15 20 pointers and 30 pointers and i brought you the diamond bags that we supply from all these bags are obvious in all sizes it comes in all millimeters and i brought you samples from our smaller goods so anything below 2mm this is the bags look just receive them this is vbs plus def white in color excellent in cut fire and finish and polish the clarity on the color on these small stones is incredible i want you guys to understand something now the difference between small diamonds and bigger diamonds is huge when it comes down to collecting or looking for quality so let's say i'm going to pick something here's a vs1 k color 4 carat k color is low but in a big stone you're buying it as a single stone by itself you're placing it on a ring by itself yes it's okay it's good you can buy let's say you pick an si quality or any other clarity we have here a size yes so here is an si1 j color 3 carat stone available these diamonds are actually amazing to make a purchase on why because it's a bigger stone you got a bigger table to play with to get the shine from when you're buying an si if it's a little inclusion to the bottom of the stone if it's a three carat you're saving tons of money yes i agree i support you if the stone is done right the clarity is right where the inclusion is in the correct spot where nobody can see it yes you want to save money you buy these stones but when it comes down to smaller diamonds smaller goods you have small tiny tables i tell you something less than vvs there's still an issue there's a problem we keep finding it with our work and that's why we do this we end up we dealt with vsvps and then we realized when our company shifted to have everything done in vbs vs def our business group our clients trust grew we have no other option the only option we have for you is vvsdef so if you want to save money and you don't want to spend so much the only thing we can do is minimize the size of the piece that we have yes i was going to tell you sometimes they go to kalani okay you know what this is my budget can you just put me aside instead instead of bvs and your answer is no no i got nothing for you in that level now stay tuned we're going on a break because we got you so much crispy pieces and on the second half we got you some serious juice stay tuned real iced out cuban versus fake and how you can actually tell the difference if it tangles you already know where is the imperfection on this cubit all cubans must be made completely solid and you won't be able to handle the way this chain is twisting on your neck because it's made cheap simply you're wearing it and just simply pull didn't take much and this chain is gone that is the issue my friend off the camera we don't want the prices on camera [Laughter] [Music] ladies and gentlemen i've talked about them dancing making moves shaking on this table now we're ready to present to you guys our dancing dinosaurs [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] welcome back to killarney jewelry freshly dalvin and the dancing dinosaurs we love it we love everything that we're doing nor got you guys a story about a mother pearl heart that we actually carved and shaved yeah to fit this golden heart so so the story behind this it was it was so simple but you know we always tell everybody dream it we make it well guess what guys this customer actually dreamt that she had a heart on her neck this is a real story guys and she said that it had all white on it so we went back and forth we said okay do you want small pearls because we're trying to understand the vision of her dream and her son wanted to give it to her for new year's which is persian new year so and it's actually today happy so we kept drawing pearls is that one pearl is a mother of pearl until we got the actual look we brought the peace of her dream to life i'm so excited for her work we made the back plane and we're going to engrave something for her on the back but look how simple it is and it can come true i love it you know we've never done carving mother pearls before but this is our first now i want to take you guys into the stunning full of sesame this dancing dinosaurs sitting on this curly look at this curly double plate rose and white with the 30 on the bale toronto max engraving all over the vision of this is for the toronto max the look is toronto max when people see toronto max they recognize it a lot of people ask me what is true auto max what is the round and max you cannot explain it because it starts with the design the vision the technology the the making the material the choice of the diamond the choice of the tools it's an engineer technology it is different it is technique it has so much to it before it becomes surrounded by so you really have to take toronto max home i always tell people once you go home with my toronto max pieces and you sit down and you start to view the diamonds how they're dancing and the water that you will understand what toronto max you'll never forget how toronto max look like look at these stunning crosses i've showed you guys the yellow gold and i told you we're making them in white and rose i love them this has a story they have a beautiful story the eye in the middle and the ankh this egyptian cross is so unique and it has the sapphires on the eye the beauty behind these crosses is they got plain eye which is the eye of life which is the key of life right and it has the diamonds in the background on the key of life itself so this is so incredible here it only happened because a client walked in and asked derek my older brother if he is able to make such a cross and he said he was going to make him a better better one and that's how we came up with this now when we wanted to structure this building and we plan to come to forest hill and we did a study on the people that lives around this area we wanted to present something special for the people for all our jewish friends and neighbors and clients so really i took it in and i said if i'm going to make a star of david it has to be unique so i kept drawing different styles and different ideas until i thought about what is religion religion is love love happens with every faith and when i wanted to think about love and faith i came out with this star of david rose y you can see the o you can see the o you can see the v and you can see the e to complete this star fully studied with the dancing dinosaurs absolutely gorgeous i call them dancing dinosaurs because they are as old as dinosaurs diamonds are even older than dinosaurs it takes hundreds of years for a stone to grow from nothing to something that's why they are living legends they have values so many people ask me like kalani you know i want to buy a piece only with gold because diamonds don't hold value yes the experience you've had and making purchases on cheap goods it makes you have no value yes that is 100 but we know we got the values we know we have the best for you and making sure all of our pieces come correct to the level of people now absolutely i want to talk about this incredible person another man from vancouver vancouver one of the biggest provinces to give us a full support this year this year we actually made it happen with our vancouver people i love you all and if you guys watching us you guys are hot fully diamond out and a lot of pieces are coming for you guys this year look at this rest a piece on his soul his brother called us we've dealt with him we've created him a wave pendant about five years ago and he lost it and we had to remake it for him he was an amazing guy if you actually chill with this guy you feel good sometimes you sit down with people for one time in life and you remember them forever and you naturally connect with them instantly i only met him once in my life and i'm getting goosebumps right now and it's crazy his brother told me that he passed away and he wanted to make a pendant of his face look at the beauty and the detail of this fully 3d with his beard his ears his eye the neck the polish the finish the solidness of it he's fully solid he's going to be on his brother's chest for the rest of his life his brother was shivering when he seen the piece he couldn't believe it you know he didn't just come all the way from vancouver to request a custom piece by kalani we don't know him he doesn't know us he just hear about us from his brother from his brother now when his brother passed away he knew he had to pass on his legacy and go back to the same person he dealt with and felt comfortable with it is crazy now i want to speak on this dinosaur this oval that's a dinosaur all right no i want you to take in the movement of it let's put it this way and show off with your finger

darkness side of that home will be bright with this black diamond now you need to do a black diamond cube and chain yes been making it's already in the making so think about this now everybody keeps thinking investment investment investment investment let me tell you there's a story behind investment when you buy a sick car and you invest 250 000 on this car or 100. you basically have to tell people you have this car because people can't see you holding the car in your hand and walking around if you meet a woman you basically have to tell her what's your car look like can i take you home but when you have collections that are made right stuff like this people will recognize you on immediately speaks for itself no matter where you at if you're wearing shorts and sandals with one simple little cuban bracelet like this you're definitely gonna stand out between the whole entire card and everybody's going to recognize you are part of the kilani crew yes that is hot and crispy i love it

such a long time so thank you for watching and i'll see you soon [Music] you", "sK3812ZTl_c": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to another recipe tutorial today i'm going to be teaching you how to make the best gluten-free baguettes they have a nice chewy crust and they're lovely and squidgy on the inside so let's get baking the first thing you're going to need to do is activate your yeast to do this you want a jug with some warm water and then you're going to stir in two tablespoons of caster sugar once you've done this add your yeast i'm using the allenton's easy bake yeast but there are a few gluten-free varieties give it a good stir and then cover this now you want to leave it in a warm place for five minutes and while we're doing that we're going to prepare our other ingredients so here i'm adding xanthan gum and salt to some gluten-free white bread flour and then for the wet ingredients i'm going to crack two egg whites into a bowl now this is how i separate my eggs but you can also do it other ways such as pouring the egg through your fingers and chopping the yolk that way make sure you don't get the yolk in put them to one side they're great in omelettes or if you want to make some custard i'm also adding some olive oil to this and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar which just helps with the texture of the bread and then you want to give this a good whisk we're not looking to create anything like you would if you were making a meringue we just want a few little bubbles like this and the final thing you want to do whilst we're waiting for our yeast to activate is to get your baguette tray which looks like this and to grease it with some olive oil and then flour it as well now i'd really recommend getting a baguette tray and i will link this one down below in the caption because i think it's really important to get those lovely little bubbles on the bottom of the baguette and it also helps it to cook evenly you could probably make this on a baking tray but this is the way to get the perfect baguette shape and now you can see after five to ten minutes my yeast has a lovely foam on top and it's time to make the dough [Music] so i'm just going to really simply add everything to one mixing bowl so i popped in the dry ingredients now i'm popping in the yeast mixture and then we're just going to add in those egg whites and vinegar and oil and then it's really a case of just mixing this up so if you're making traditional normal bread you'll find that you'd have a really thick dough that you can knead but gluten-free bread is not the same so with this you can see you want a really thick sticky batter and you're really going to have to get in there with the wooden spoon it takes a bit of work but it is worth it trust me so once you've got this dough and you can see it was coming away from the mixing bowl slightly it's time to shape your baguettes to do this i like to flour a work surface i use either plain gluten-free flour or rice flour for this and then i'm just going to scrape half of the dough out onto this now i'm just using a cheap bread scraper that i've got which is pretty handy for this sort of thing and then you want to flour your hands as well to make sure the dough doesn't stick roll the dough in the flour so that it's not sticky at all and then just use your hands to shape it into this sort of rough baguette shape and as you can see it's fatter in the middle and then tape it out towards the ends which is the kind of shape you'd find if you're buying a normal baguette in the shops and then once you've got it it should be about 12 inches long roughly i'm just gonna lift it up and pop it in the baguette tray smooth out any lumps and bumps and then you're just going to repeat exactly the same thing with the rest of the dough so we're aiming for two baguettes they're about the same size i've done this by eye but you can measure out the weight of the dough if you want to and then you can get exactly half of the dough in each baguette so once you've shaped the second one and again you can see just using the flour to make sure nothing sticks but we don't want to add too much flour to the mix and then i'm going to pop this in and then you can find as well that if you have got any dough which is not quite the shape you want it you can just use your bread scraper to kind of neaten off the edges a bit but don't worry too much because we're going to prove this now so i've put mine on a tray stop it making such a mess and then i've just wrapped it really loosely in some oiled cling film and we want to leave this for about an hour and a half to two hours until it puffs up to about one and a half times its size like this now these baguettes if you feel them will feel nice and light and puffy and once they have pretty much proved when you're preheating your oven you want to add in some boiling water now i pop this in a deep roasting tin at the bottom of the oven and this is the secret to the perfect chewy crust so what we're going to do is i'm just going to flour the baguettes lightly and slash them to make sure that they don't burst open and then it's time to pop them in the oven and look at that steam that is going to create just the best crust and look here we go 20 to 25 minutes later gorgeously golden baguettes as you can see they're lovely and crisp crunchy on the outside in a minute i'll cut into it and you'll see how squishy they are inside and they've got those gorgeous little bubbles on the bottom which is just like bakery bread this is the kind of thing that i really miss with gluten-free baking so it's so nice to be able to replicate it at home now you want to leave them for at least half an hour to an hour you've got to let the gum settle you want warm bread not hot bread but as you can see when you cut into them they've got lovely air bubbles they're nice and squishy and they've got this gorgeous crust they are just so nice perfect for filling perfect for garlic bread or dipping in soup if you like this video make sure you hit subscribe down below give me a thumbs up and check out the description for the full written recipe on the blog you", "ixoWM97B5UY": "[Music] you", "U1NIhH3ELHk": "we often divide people in two groups the extraverts who'd rather tell people what's wrong to go well \"hey could you hold this for me for a bit ?\"\n*holding his feelings* *Parseltongue speech* SPOOOOIK ! and the introverts who'd do the exact opposite \"haha what? Don't worry i'm all right, everything's ok\"\n*monster noise in the background and hide feelings* another SPOOOIK but lower In reality , it's rare to hear someone say that he is extrovert : \"Oh me. I love talking in front of a lot of people ,the last time I was reciting Shakespeare in the street And I didn't realize, but there were a thousand people who were applauding   Mhmmm... I especially think you're extra mytho While me, just to buy bread I'm like this :\n\"And here I tell her Hello, a baguette please\" no, I say \"Hello, a not overcooked baguette please\" And after I say \"goodbye, have a good da... thank you!\"\n*embarrassed laugh* Hel *Throat clearing* Hello Ah, good evening!\nWhat do you need? A baguette please Sorry? Hum... bread? What? BREAD A FLY (braguette in french) OKAY *embarrassed laugh*\nThank you too... oh...no... Cause we have to admit that communicating it's shit We are super-zero at that That's why we invented the written messages And especially the emojis\nOtherwise it's confusing... \"I'm in front of your home\" Huh? \"I bring you back your disguise and the knife That you forgot at my place\" on the other hand it's normal the parked minivan in front of the door wide open ? HELLO ! *scream*  it's soon the end of the show ! it was not great, as a shock sentence... But I always don't know what to say, in those moments... this blocked me, the clown...   I was trying to find something with the clown, the disguise I wear... Hello, you didn't take your tickets to see the clown, *embarrassed laugh*! No, it's even worse... / Don't worry, I know...   It's hard, communication...  If you saw how my girlfriend struggle sometimes, a ca-ta-strophe *laughs* It's me the catastrophe ? *another scream* *forced laugh* A forced laugh, this video is great And then you say : what happens ? why are you interrupting your own video who is great to see ? I wanna tell you '' No I wouldn't make a product placement now because it would be at the end of the video Actually I had a sketch who comes now in the video which allowed a good transition with the next sketches. But my problem is it was crappy but really CRAPPY I did what I could, it didn't work. So what I propose you instead, is a DrAwInG tUtOrIaL Isn't it awesome ? Plus it will do a smooth transition So we do a circle for the head, with a cute little body and little feets, little eyes, he's happy, let's say it's a pirate Hop, hop, the little shoes, shit I forgot the arms... great He's ready for adventure. He's in a forest and he says: \"let's go for advenure\" And he arrives in front of something. What is it. I'TS A DOG ! So he looks at it, the dog looks at him, and then he does \"YAP! YAP YAP YAP! (the pirate:) I don't talk the dog language! And then the dog runs away *ZOOM* Oh no the dog ! So he follows him he walks and oh ! the dog with a chest ! So he opens the chest, and inside there's THE DOG ! YAP! And the treasure was friendship. The end It wasn't a so good idea...  *end of the transition* Sometimes when we talk in another languauge, we feel ultra hot After one drink or two, there is always these people who totally break free despite their horrible english. *really bad english accent* \"Oh my friend ! Let it be ! Life is cool, hey ! Everybody listen ! Like Obama said \"Don't worry, be happy\" heeeyyy   yeaaaahhh... When we're young, we often have this ourselves image who'll announce what we are when we grow up. Like if our school years define our future. But it's totally false People can't go in just one category. Me for exemple, I was nearly all when I was in middle school/high school. I had a lot of friends, in a lot of different groups. I spend so much time with the nerds who reads mangas, than with morons who smoke and fight, or the graphers who skip class for painting abandonned things. So you're extravert ! But most of the time I was alone, with too much thoughts for my little frustrated teen head Not far from my place, there's a surf spot that very few people know and I often went there just for being alone, in the middle of the water. Oh terrible element ! see my bad luck ? Being a simple sad and pale teenager, I implore you, Poseidon, send me Pokemon cards (rimes in french ^^) Ah shit it's lousy as a rhyme... So you're introvert ! But at school I did all to point out. I always wanted to find the word for making people laugh   So remember that, because it will be part of the test / -icle ! testicle ahahahaaa So tomorrow don't forget to bring a pencil and a card. /- POKEMON ! Ah no I remember: it sucks as a rhyme. / Oh no ! I can't ! His joke sucks too much !! Can I go to the toilets ? ouch. But finally I was funny because I hated being alone / So you're extravert ! But I hated talk with other people too, because at this age it's rare to have interresting conversations/ Ah ! you're introoo.... Shhhhh.... Don't say anything... It's more that adolescence is a life passage ultra chaotic: you don't understand how you're feeling, or what you want and you hate that. But the positive side, is that it goes very quickly, you're gonna grow up, and you'll understand better how you feel. And you'll be able to analyze your mistakes more easily. But you'll still don't know what you want. It's cool that life is a little made for test eveything. And as will say this old guy Brandon sit under a tree: \" you know, young people, in life, the most importat isn't the way, it's the result. No, wait, shit it's the opposite ! Voil\u00e0! I hope you like this episode, In any case, a huge thank you to all the people, your reactions on the last episode it was very cool I wanna thank NordVPN who sponsorised this video, it's an app that encrypts yours informations fro not being vulnerable online. You know when you connect to a public wifi like MacDonalds, or an airport, this si where it's easy to hack your phone, and take all of your informations, and you're DiSgUsTeD ^^ but I use it too for reroute my ID adress from another country it allows me for exemple to watch series which are available only in the USA on Netflix. Very convenient = ) They actually made an interface who is very simple to use so in 2 clicks you can connect you on the internet of any country. And what's really cool, is that the same account, you can use it on many devices Me, I use it for my computer, my phone, and my iPad at the same time. The promotion that they propose it's -75% during three years, so it does 2,60 euros by month I think Don't hesitate to go on the link in the description,   for see if that interests you, and if not, they have a refund policy, and they rewind everything under thirty days. Voil\u00e0! now I'm gonna hurry to release my next episode, because this one took me so much time. So... See u ? pewww"}
