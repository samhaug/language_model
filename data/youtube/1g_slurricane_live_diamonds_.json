{"MkSRS7QzefY": "i'm going to show you a fake glow cart versus a real glow cart real packaging fake packaging super big 10 of these are not going to fit in when a box meant for these that one came in this box 10 came in here see 10 cow this is also old boxes these are still floating around so just because your box looks like this doesn't mean it's fake just means it's old these are the new boxes new carts boxes i believe the cartridge itself is still the same good that's the carts this was a real glue cart i finished it a while ago and i just kept it in the box and didn't ever think i'd make a video like this um but my buddy actually got this one and i told him to get me one because i wanted to make this video he didn't charge me i mean he did charge me for it but i'm just going to give him a real cart instead it's showing the difference um charge me 20 bucks for it i normally pay about or two for these p 22 20 anywhere between 22 and 25 is what i pay for these right now it's not the best price but hey it works um this is the real one i'm sorry i mean i paid 22 to 25 for these these are the real ones not that um but as you can see there's something still in here it's a gold oil gold amber color oil all of them are they're all like this this is a fake one that should crystal clear they're not crystal clear but i don't know what the [ __ ] that is it's some weird [ __ ] and that's how it is when you turn it upside down it moves slow this is still like i think this is delta eight tell you the truth i think somebody stuck delta eight in a fake glow card because it's harsh as [ __ ] and it like gives you this weird like hi i only took a couple hits off this thing and try it out to see what the [ __ ] it was uh because my buddy was smoking them and uh they didn't do [ __ ] to him yet but you know i don't know it's one of those weird things i wouldn't i'm not going to smoke this [ __ ] i'm throwing this out after this video actually i'm going to keep it just for like you know future references never know make another video um but yeah that's another thing you can tell the fake ones you see the way it says glow right there for one that looks [ __ ] weird why does it look like that on the metal piece right here that shouldn't even be there um that's how you that's a dead giveaway your card's fake all cards that have that are fake glue has never done that has a california logo on it but that's that doesn't matter so this is another thing i was going to address right there it says c cell on there but that's fake because these aren't real c cells these are some shitty [ __ ] um but they've done that that's the fake one this is the real one and the real one it looks like it's actually like engraved in there like laser etched not engraved but it's like done with the laser that almost looks like yellow paint yeah this almost looks like yellow paint so not that is um the middle of the rod right here in the middle is super thick on this one too you can notice that this this metal rod right here is thicker than this one is see and if you say oh it's because the liquid is magnifying it or something i will show you another part of glows where's my [ __ ] battery yet give me one second guys this is my cart that i'm using right now you see [ __ ] is hella thicker still now rose isn't the best oil around you know you're still gonna get bubbles and everything those are just air bubbles something don't move when you turn it upside down so you know these aren't real clothes you can piece it oh it looks there's all those bubbles in it they're [ __ ] air bubbles you don't know [ __ ] don't talk [ __ ] did you see this i got [ __ ] boxes you know i don't have to worry about getting fakes i buy them by the box bro there's another [ __ ] box somewhere here by the box you know i'm able to [ __ ] track my [ __ ] i don't know about y'all i have like my plugs going directly from these vendors these glow vendors so we know a thing or two about the you know good carts for the price you know for a street car here in my state cost about 130 prior to tax for a gram car of distillate distill it not no special rso anything like that just distill it and i couldn't imagine paying more than 20 25 bucks for one of these things dude i just can't so yeah um you want to see you know be like oh that's a fake card still i'll [ __ ] pop open another one for you guys i glow even sent me this is one of their older masks they have new ones out now you can tell i put it through the machine they also sent me a hoodie but that [ __ ] was too small that is an xl i wear like [ __ ] 3x bro i'm [ __ ] 6'2 and 250 260 pounds dude come on help me out here [ __ ] i can't try and do this one [ __ ] hand in my ass here we go there's a fresh cart right here this is the uh cereal milk i wonder if that strains supposed to be sold anyways is this like one of those terpenes i don't know i kind of think i low-key just think it's different terpenes they add to their distillates so it gives it its flavor because it's kind of artificial you know it's an artificial flavor and for sure but um yeah no it's just uh cards are pretty you know all the same say glow extracts right there as you see california they come with seals the glow um then there's a couple's likes they should all always come in a box like this now these are the updated packaging like i said there's still these around because like let's just say i know a thing or two about them and they were still making you get some of these when you ordered the new ones and uh yeah you got the new ones you had to get some of these oh sorry i just got a message i was reading that and uh you had to order some of the older ones obviously get the new ones so they wouldn't be stuck with a [ __ ] ton of old ones you know nobody wants that and they wanted to get their supply out so that's what happened with that um besides that happy smoking you know i hope you really enjoy it um you know i'm just trying to help you guys not get ripped off like i said don't buy these big-ass boxes what's in a big-ass box where the cart doesn't fit snuggly like these carts fit snugly in here you know they move around a little bit but not much in here the cart's going to move around like [ __ ] crazy it's just not it's going to move you know that's a dead giveaway [Music] they don't even make these anymore but this is the same one of that box this one was the real one oh yeah this is another thing i know look towards this little extracts right here and right here says glow extracts there's a space between there shouldn't be that so yeah look out there guys don't get ripped off please", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "rap9wQIVTgY": "[Music] answers to all the questions you've ever had about weeds what's up and

hit a really nice hit that doesn't sound nice but it is nice whoa that's a puddle that's a sticky q-tip after two fat dabs this I'm already getting a nice high coming on it's all in my head I feel like mr Mackey when his head got real big when he took LSD maybe not quite that high but I feel pretty good this stuff tastes real good to taste crazy good like before I can even get the carb cap on I'm like wolf wool with the taste it's just like it smells super sour this stuff looks fire it smells fire it tastes fire I like the high a lot this is some good hash for 4/20 I think I'm gonna dab

you've ever had about weeds today we're gonna do a review of this gelato cake live diamonds and sauce from Vince got the fancy iPhone again to take some close-up shots so let's see what this stuff looks like here's the box we got seventy seven point six seven percent THC and the packaging just looks really awesome I love these boxes and I love all the graphics on them the box from last week looks awesome that's last week's review don't forget to check that out I even got this Vince key dad now well it's really like a mousepad but I'm using it as a dad mat right now I really love their branding I really love their hash - let's see what this stuff looks like whoo Oh God look at this I mean it's it's so wet and it's like poured up the side a little bit you see that there's a nice mix of diamonds and sauce look at this that's sort of a bummer I got some stuff to the lid but that's okay we'll get it later oh this stuff has such a deep musky scent oh oh I don't know what that smells like but it smells so good it smells like um definitely like an indica like a cushy Diesel II earthy type of oh I wish you could smell this oh god it smells so good alright I know it's smelling let's do some Davin let's see how much of this wet stuff we can balance on here while we heat up the banger and get all this off the side might as well get that chunky crystal straight diamonds how wet it is oh the terms dude I mean that looks like a pretty dangerous amount that dab really wants to drip off with that so bad please don't little buddy please we'll just make it oh my god it's barely hanging up okay maybe I can set up the camera phone the camera phone will heat up your dad at the same time okay okay what's the name of this phone this iPhone 11 Pro max it's really cool for close-up stuff I like using it for a number two camera yes bonus fire it takes really really sick close-up multi-shot zap ash yes I want one of your best hashed filming phones please all right here we go buddy it's a lot okay strange Oh [Music] they're nice that was a smooth smooth dab so super smooth and it tasted exactly like it smells unless we need to put a word to this smell it's a I mean what would I call this taste alone I don't have a word for it yet I'm gonna hit another down and we're gonna decide the taste but it tastes like a very indica dominant earthy pungent musky a robust it tastes like Mother Nature's tittie nipple if you sucked on it well you gotta figure out some better descriptive terms than that we need to hit another dab the store still sucks but I raised the phone camera so we don't got to do this awkward bending over on the counter I hit a dab stuff cuz that was mad weird I don't know if you've seen the weirdness in it but I felt it I felt the weird and it wasn't the kind of weird I like to feel gonna see Jade cicada tonight you don't know Jade cicada I will leave a link to his music you need to check that out too gelato cake live diamonds and sauce strange oh yeah just going hidden over and over and over again it's never-ending dab stopper whoa I think mother nature's tittie nipple think I still like that because there's so many earthy elements that I could use to describe this super weird super good never tasted any anything that isn't a weed product that tastes anything like this like the world don't taste like this unless you're smoking weed but if you lived your whole life and never spoke no dank weed and then you just walked into a dispensary and got blooming SuperDuper gumdrop gelato cake and all these fruity exotic strains you're gonna start tasting things you've never tasted in your whole life like that yeah that's what this what we taste like okay Oh weed if you know someone that doesn't smoke weed serving this videos and tell them show them you see his excitement do you see how excited because of how these dabs taste live resin man live resin is pretty much like a whole a live weed plant if you don't know how they make live resin I got a little video about that it's pretty interesting stuff but all right that's the - dabs in we're gonna piece it out for 20 minutes and I'll be right back to let you know how the high from this stuff is so it's been about 23 minutes I feel good in stone after I hit those dabs I had this head that heavy chest feeling I had that for probably half the time I've been gone for the whole 10 minutes still feeling like I might cough I mean this stuff although it hits real smooth it's like it reaches in and grabs you and just remember on Game of Thrones or that giant crush that little girl oh that's what this did to me for ten minutes but in the best way possible that it could do that I wouldn't matter at all I wasn't in pain I know it wasn't not enjoying myself but I was just like felt like I was gonna bust a little drop a sweat Vince Clive revs and diamonds and sauce it's a lot okay I'm gonna give this like a nine point five out of ten very good if you remember I only paid two dollars for both of these we're not even gonna judge on price because the price was awesome yeah check out the video from the honey number for live diamonds review and you can see how I ended up getting both of these guys or two bugs and so I highly recommend this stuff I don't know about Alec Colorado but here in Colorado this brand Vince carb in ski how do you say this everybody I know says it a different way I think I'm like Vince key better but if it's been Skyy want to know I don't want to be saying the wrong stuff but if you see this in your local dispensary I highly highly recommend

they're all over the screen knees", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like

porn on Instagram I'm popcorn TV on Twitter but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of

than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "ikmfHObhYjk": "[Music] what's up guys simplisik here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is the reaction video to clean carts part two requested by brandon horsford shout out to you you know what i'm saying you know with these types of reaction videos i like to basically put the comments from the previous video on the screen so let's go right now [Music] now that we got that out of the way today is november 2nd and i will be uploading it tomorrow on tuesday but i will not be going live because i do have to take my dog tomorrow to the vet and it could take all day so uh here is this video and you know to make up for it but usually on tuesdays i usually go live i don't really upload a video so this will be for today i don't know if i'm going to be going live but at least i have this video out so uh yeah i'm gonna take a hit of this bear labs cartridge the gorilla glue 4. i do have a video on this but you will probably see it later in this video cheers boys good stuff let me take another hit good stuff all right so here we are here on clean carts we are gonna go to the new post need help with some cheap touch lists and pawn batteries uh the coach run you know what i'm saying i don't know how much this is this is a company based in canada so i don't know if the shipping fee is going to be a lot more than usual you know so um but yeah i would have um maybe the yo can as well and also the pocket uh the dash vape all good stuff just such a smooth feeling never seen this before looks pretty cool looks like a bullet or no no it's a very long magnetic bottom piece we got a california gold pin legit or not so on the last video i didn't mention that they do label the things fake or not you can see there's a fake right there so this one's fake um but honestly it's all ceramic card all ceramic cards just look really nice to me i don't know it's just it just looks really nice all white and uh i don't know smoking on that orange platinum cookies or orange cookies platinum dates from michigan potentially dangerous why the reason this is because the michigan branch of beauty has released some shady products okay that's good to know so a very cool subreddit they they'll tell you right away or a moderator will at least mark it so they'll let you know the possibilities the potential dangers of what it can have that's really that's really dope you know what i'm saying and i really [ __ ] with that and uh with the cartridge connoisseurs out there you know i would definitely you know go in this site you know what i'm saying so or the subreddit we got the dime like i mentioned dime contacted me so we might be getting something in the future for the channel you know then all that you have to prove my car is going rub it in the mods face someone just put [ __ ] post that's funny 93 thc let's just read some of these comments i mean the oil looks good but here's the thing with oil when it comes down to oil you can't really tell you know you don't have a microscopic [ __ ] eyes where you can see down to the [ __ ] the you know the atoms or some [ __ ] you know it's it's harder to tell with weed you can see you can smell you know you can see it looks like trash it probably is trash you know but with the cartridge unless you really hit it or i mean if it gives off a smell like yeah it's really hard to tell you know so just be careful let's read this is just an entire starter guy thing that accuses in defensive violence not gonna lie when you flag my dc medical bias suspect it wrestled my jimmies but you're right why did the dispensary that took my money under a state mandated medical marijuana but not follow all the rules in the program is a question i now ask and the question only serves to protect my dumbass is it all right yes sadly at least it seems to be the case based on the interactions has it been experienced there seemed to be three types of coming here to brigade the first and most obvious are the fake and dirty card cut hardware sellers who come here to push and get banned you know my poi works at krt and he says they are made by raw garden just sold out the bag i've heard that before right there's a couple hundred of these on the banned list the second is people who come here asked about fakes who were told they were fakes couldn't provide any proof to the opposite then this is the key part either responding by trolling or pushing fakes as hard as they can or by flipping the [ __ ] out and insulting and cursing myself or other users and so were banned calling me and and variations other than the course of action double down on the breaking rules of launching personal attacks and get them in there's another couple hundred of these people on the ban list damn okay he wrote a whole story i feel it you know that happens there's trolls on everything my channel [ __ ] this subreddit on every type of forum possible you know and it's just you're just gonna have to deal with it and that's why we have good moderators to just put that [ __ ] so no one else can see it you know i do have a lot of moderators on my channel and i do see some of the contents a lot of bots and stuff and it says banned by moderator and all that stuff so i know my moderators are helping the channel out because if i leave that on myself most of the time it just goes to hell to review or spam but if i leave it on itself it gives people an opportunity to get ripped off you know maybe they're not or very gullible and they call one of these numbers to order some these [ __ ] products that someone's selling on that comment you know and it's my responsibility so like i try to get rid of that as much as possible because no one wants that no oh hit me up on whatsapp and shut the [ __ ] up no smoking from that clean loud questions about extract labs delta 8 have a lot of things going for them and possibly question them they're good but delta e still seen sketch but they have live results i have no comment with delta eight but i know it's legal still i don't know if it's still legal i know it was legal or it still is and uh i have no opinion on that but like honestly if this is a legal way of people in illegal states to get high then i'm all for it you know you can buy it off the website if it's tested and all that stuff are indeed all that stuff good then i'm all for it you know because it's better than buying off the street if you can buy legal delta thc delta eight thc you know what i'm saying like [ __ ] the streets i'm not saying [ __ ] the streets i meant to [ __ ] the street cards sounded um but anyone know if crystal creek organics delta is legit it says fake right there this one was it fake as well potentially dangerous okay see they still mark it you know obviously there's not much on delta eight so it could be potentially dangerous these ones are fake as well [Music] let's see i was loving eureka and that was fake a lot of people have been mentioning um if i've ever tried eureka i've never tried eureka i've never even seen it near me um but it says fake right here so entry base cleared you know this is a legit brand i have never tried to this day um tree tree base clear i'm not sure if it's this i'm pretty sure it's this is water clear i don't think uh yeah see it real or not the worst pictures ever what was this another one of those uh plug and play copies uh just steer just be careful you know what i'm saying like they could be good they could be bad you know at the end of the day that's 50 50 and that is not good chances at all you know so heal this up with the letters no that's what he did i mean i thought this was like known you know when or when oil is hot it's very runny when it's cold or room temperature it's gonna move like molasses you know so we got the blue dream i don't know i don't know about these this one at least i don't know what that is suspicious they marked it revolution craft live resin okay looks pretty good real or fake 4 000 scans what does that mean fake damn they made his market fake picked up a lot of raw garden highest thc and they got a lot of flavors on the back is that the flavor rx what is this green dot so you know just because it's legal and i don't know it you know i don't know all this every state's legal carts okay so please just bear with me uh i don't know all of california's carts and this is the state i live in so like i said just because i don't know it um and i say maybe it's fake uh it could be real as well because i don't know i don't know all the information on that [ __ ] so it's just me reacting to the subreddit shout out to brandon for uh you know requesting it but puffing on the knife strawberry call i actually tried stizzy the other day with uh my uh my cousin's girlfriend had it and she let me try it it was a skywalker the this lit really really good for distally you know i'm not really a fan of the or like a weird like pine terps i'm not a fan of that i mean it's okay you know um but if i had to choose it would definitely be like more of a cannabis derived terpenes that's what i prefer i like cannabis derived terpenes with distillate i like that raw garden hole formula that they have a lot of people don't like it i actually do like it i think it's the best of both worlds highest thc raw garden i've ever had wow 93 okay so we got the g leaf distillate it's very dark for distillate but i've seen darkness live before uh plug-and-play had some so first homie cart from wax not bad not bad at all not bad at all brother all right so then we got the red sky i've never seen this it says fake damn here's another windy city cars oh my god really chicago cars i know chicago is legal now recreational so uh this i mean it says fake right here who knows who knows he posted it twice it was like reinsurance he wanted some he wanted some opinions on that okay exhale new pickups drip someone mentioned this recently um they do look like they have the sticker manufacturer date and all that stuff these look pretty legit it says clean i think we're going to end it off on those all right so that is going to be it for the clean carts part 2 reaction on reddit hopefully you enjoyed it let me know what other reaction videos you want me to do and like i said i won't be i don't know if i'm gonna be coming back home to go live on tuesday or tomorrow whenever you see this video if i don't at least this video will be up so hopefully you enjoyed it like the video subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "379D9Lepa5U": "five metro boy vasquez we're gonna be doing another cartridge video thank you guys for watching you know i really appreciate all the support all the love i've been getting um if you haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i'd really appreciate that but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself my bad on the um uploading videos you know just my schedule is kind of [ __ ] up and i'm gonna be out for like about a month month and a half of work i best pump out a shitload of videos for you guys but today guys um i read that on my cartridge um i've heard of the cure company i was smoking a cartridge of it and kind of ran out so decided to go get another one but if you guys haven't had these cartridges guys they're so fire they're this is the cartridges but the taste is spot on like the quality it's so good it tastes like actual weed you know and the cartridge is ceramic which is dope so that's pretty nice but um i ended up i ended up getting a buddies cartridge guys uh those who've had buddies those who've tried buddies before the cartridge let me know in the comment section of how it was i've never had buddies before the reason i ended up getting it it's just um there's like a couple people that will always comment on my videos saying to try buddies that it's so good this and that so so the good thing about these cartridges that really caught my attention is that their terpene profile they have a label on there um you know um telling you what specifically is in the cartridge which is dope you know to me that's like some good packaging you know really catches my attention you know because i like to see what's in my cartridges and here you have the nice um it tells you what kind of terpenes you know you have in there so that's pretty dope so the total thc on this cartridge is 82 which is not bad for a live resin cartridges because if you guys know live resin ranges from like 60 to 70 percent you know it's not like this lower distal cartridges range from 80s to high 90s so that's pretty dope so here we have the i was looking at the flavors and [ __ ] and this was the one that caught my attention it's a peach flambe pineapple upside down cake that sounds hella good right so that's one of the reasons i ended up getting this cartridge is just like really caught my strain really caught my attention so here you guys have it it's not like a dark amber color like other live resins are like dark amber color like the ursa cartridges or like a moxie live resin you know it's not as dark but it's really clear and it has a nice little tint to it so i'm gonna go ahead and try it out for you guys i was hitting it earlier but you know i'm gonna decide to do a video today uh for you guys because um i'm gonna be going on my little run today i'm right here at a park you know do a little jogging get some runs in you know but other than that guys cheers hopefully you guys are smoking along with me let me show you guys the quality on it it's pretty good you know so we're gonna go ahead and try it out the taste on it it's like spot on it tastes like actual weave that's a good thing about live resins you know um if you guys have these in your pockets after hitting a couple times this thing is going to stink up here man like if you're like in the office or like at your job site or something be sure not to have these in your pocket because these live resident cars just do stink up your pocket and you know people are gonna think you have weed in there that's how strong they are but it tastes really good guys i'm going to take another hit guys to get extra bait you know cheers now the taste to be honest guys it does taste like a little peachy but at the same time you do get the fruitiness of a pineapple which is pretty so the flavor is a little bit peachy and you do get like a nice fruity pineapple flavor to it but it's like a really good clean pineapple it doesn't taste like a fake like a distillery type of flavor you know it tastes really clean you know i'm really satisfied with these cartridges they also have some uh besides the cartridges they also have some wax which i've never had before but i'm definitely gonna have to try them now because these cartridges are fire guys so this is my little label that i got you know my dispensary so you guys can see i don't want to hear another but other than that guys um i've been pretty good myself and i'm just kicking back let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see but i'm gonna be getting into like more weed videos you know like more pre-rolls and [ __ ] like that you know just like i said i've been really busy guys but you know i'm not gonna stop making videos you know what i mean this is this is something i enjoy doing so i'm gonna keep doing it so and also you know let me know if you guys love these types of cartridges these sea salt cartridges are [ __ ] good you know every cartridge option they always hit you know with these cell tips they're like the best ones you guys can get cheers guys i'm already like high as [ __ ] like before i got to the park um i was hitting it like two three times so i'm already loaded so hopefully you guys are smoking along with me man now for the price i ended up paying like thirty five dollars for a full gram cartridge of live resident buddies that's a good as deal guys all right here we go you guys have weed maps look up the shop uh patient care first or just type in pcf just type in pcf and they'll come up and you guys can just literally look on the website and the prices you guys see on there it's the exact same price but just maybe like five dollars with tax you know so it's just [ __ ] cheap everything like cartridges but not dirt dirt cheap but compared to other prices in other cities it's it's a bang for your buck so yeah i'm just trying to get baked that [ __ ] before i go on my little jog [Laughter] it's mandatory you guys get paid before you guys do exercise that makes it so much better i don't got the crawling guys i'm just coughing but other than that guys i really appreciate you guys for watching my videos and if you guys would like to see more videos like this go ahead and leave a like and don't forget to subscribe if you guys are new to the channel i would really appreciate that and don't forget to add the at the instagram and snapchat guys i'm more active on snapchat but i'm gonna try my best to get more on the instagram so let me give you guys a little close up right here other than that guys thanks for watching peace", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going

it out for this video I will be trying this is the Platinum garlic live sauce by Willamette Valley alchemy alright so this is the platinum garlic this is a live sauce it's very salty and I'm gonna be trying out for the first time here oh really quick before we open it up we're gonna tell the test results here now on this product it does not actually say a percentage so like these ones by Willamette they say percentage right there and whatnot this one however doesn't okay there's no percentage except for the terpene percent the terpene percent is 8 point 23% terpenes on this product right here however it does say th see the total container is 630 point 6 milligrams so I'm assuming and somebody correct me if I'm wrong that's in the 60 percentile it's like 63 64 percent around there correct me if I'm wrong somebody in the comment section but I believe that's how it goes so this should be around in the 60 percentiles somewhere in there alright and this again is 8 point 23 percent on the terpenes I guess this is more of a product where they focus more on the terpenes the flavor the taste then they do like actual THC I guess maybe maybe not I don't know but I kind of get that where you know the terpenes seem to be the main focus so that that's what I gather from this product I could be totally wrong maybe that's not the way they intended it but that's what I gather so far from just you know being able to read everything you know the terpenes are right there and a percentage easy to read right there the front however all the other stuff is in the back and there's no percentage of it it's milligrams so leads me to believe that we're supposed to be focusing on the terpenes for this product ok which most sauces are like them alright now we open it up I got in there nice little logo right there we'll have a valley logo look at all sexy as [ __ ] and then I open it up and you get a wooden coin in wooden coins says welcome to the Willamette Valley alchemy family this is the shield shield is going to protect me from nasty dabs nasty dabs this keeps the nasty dabs away all right so if you got that open blast shitty butane soup you know what I mean dad's keep it away I got the shield it's gonna protect me right over here protect me at all times all right you got a nice little glass container here and make sure there's nothing else in there now the farm that made the product that they use to make this product is a rogue farmer okay that is the farm that they use to cultivate to make this okay well lament valley is just the processor and this live sauce this platinum garlic is an indica so in the couch so to speak is this should be a body hi nice relaxing body hi this should be like you know something it'd be like anybody going through like really hard pain anybody going through appetite situations where you know loss of appetite and stuff like that anybody going through you know problems with insomnia sleeping stuff like that in because the way you should go and whoa whoa whoa oh that smells delicious that really does holy [ __ ] okay so that is what we're [ __ ] with right there guys look at how beautiful look at how beautiful of a product that is that is a really nice product you have to admit you have to admit that is it even if you don't like sauce even if you don't like this kind of consistency in your dabs this is right here look sexy nice nice very very vibrant golden color to it and it smells delicious all right so let's try this I can't wait any longer let's try this if you've ever had this product before the Platinum garlic's garlic's if you've ever had the Platinum garlic then let me know in the comment section below on this video your thoughts and opinions on this product if you've ever tried Willamette Valley products then let me know your thoughts on that company in the comment section below or I'm always wanting to know other people's thoughts and opinions on some of these products that I try so let me know your thoughts in the comment section a big shout out to Empire Glass Works we're gonna use use this UV glass right right there up to nice little designs in there you guys probably seen it in my other videos but I like it I really like this piece it's one of my absolute favorites [Music] [Music] all right so I got a nice little hearty sized dab here of this live sauce and we're gonna wait for this nail to cool down because we definitely do not want to take it hot we want to make sure that we take this product at the right temperature okay cuz when you have a product that focuses on the terpenes like this one does you want to make sure that you take it at the right temperature so you can get the full experience the full flavor the whole package you know what I mean now really quick while we're letting this cool down let me tell you guys if you guys ever have glass cases like this these little glass containers and you guys got this kind of sauce or anything like that in them you'll notice that you know no matter what you do with your dab stick as much as you try to get it all you can't ever get it all okay there's always like a little bits that will stick over here to the sides and da-da-da-da-da and you just get in there with your dad stick but unfortunately you can't get every little last drop well I have a solution for your problem all you need to use is a straw that's right a plastic straw a drinking straw make sure it's clean and get it on in there get all the little bits all every little bit in there and then you just take your little dab stick and go poop and you got it on the end of your damn stick okay it's that easy just a little helpful technique if you guys are having issues with that I actually have a video on that so go check it out if you're interested we should be right we're located here we go much love guys thank you for watching the video you guys are all [ __ ] awesome [Music] [Music] all right I'm high as you guys could clearly see that did the trick okay that was really great the high is great all right I love it definitely Zach offer made me cough but taste it great okay you get a perfect blend of what I'm assuming is Platinum Girl Scout cookies I'm assuming that's what makes the Platinum side of this platinum garlic because you definitely get kind of a tinge of that you definitely get kind of like a little flavor you know just a little tinge of it and I really like it and you definitely get the garlic okay the garlic's there if you've ever had like garlic breath garlic cane GMO any of those kind of strains than you know what I'm talking about it's got that stinky gassy garlic taste to it you know that just pungent musters the nostrils taste to it it definitely is there it's definitely present and it's definitely I wouldn't say it's like super you know just mouth-watering gushers taste you know but it's definitely not mild either it's like somewhere in between it's it's perfect okay if you are a Terp [ __ ] okay if you were somebody that loves those terpenes that's all you're about you don't care about getting high then this is for you although you are gonna get high like high suck but seriously though this you're somebody that chases those terpenes chases that flavor this is for you check this product out now I paid $36 recreationally for this product okay now I'm sure depending on what dispensary you go to that price is going to fluctuate but that's where about around where it should be about thirty-six dollars for this one they do have other ones that range a little higher into like the 40s and stuff so just be aware this is the Platinum garlic mints not those other ones oh haha I'm a dumbass I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] dumbass the percentage is on this container not that container so everybody just go ahead and start making fun of me in the comment section right now cuz that was a total stoner move right now just go ahead I'll wait oh wait just everybody make your comments this guy's [ __ ] [ __ ] this guy's dumb this guy [ __ ] it getting too high this guy's no idea was talking about anyway so 63 percent THC so I was right okay 63 percent THC I knew it I was right and then of course I already told you guys the terpenes and it absolutely has no CBD in it okay so those are the overall test results of this product and it is an indica so I mean overall I have to give this to two thumbs up two big thumbs up that been easily hands down Amy wasn't even a hard decision to make sometimes I've had hard decisions because I like to reserve my two thumbs up for products that are really good okay so that way if you guys ever decide to try any of these products that you see in my videos you'll somewhat agree with me I've had a lot of people agree with me that's you know but you know products to get to thumbs up highly highly recommended I haven't had a single person complain be like oh that [ __ ] you recommended was garbage you know like everything that I try to preserve the double thumbs up for really good and this definitely earned it okay hands down this is a product at that price point that kind of you know sauce live sauce that kind of flavor that kind of chirps that kind of high I'm pretty high yeah man that is definitely two thumbs up worthy right there so it has definitely earned it big shout out to Willamette Valley alchemy you can follow them on Facebook and Instagram they are a really good company okay consistency is key and they definitely keep a consistent product at good prices so check them out legal Oregon cannabis

good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "x3LShE5Al4w": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another dab cart uh more specifically glow extracts i've reviewed multiple carts from them in the past they're one of my favorite um i guess non-dispensary carts um black market whatever you'd like just whatever you'd like to call it their instagram is right there um these have been these have honestly blown up the last i'd say six months they've done a lot of updating and changes to their packaging this flavor i believe this is one of the original flavors blue diamond in the green uh i think it's the with the green sticker that box um it's an original flavor but this is the updated packaging uh it's been out for a while the golden trap trapezoid kite looking shapes on it you can pause that if you'd like warning cancer and reproductive harm ouch um but yeah i just want to show you guys this flavor and just keep you updated on what the newest glow cards look like um glow extracts on the bottom there i've obviously cheaped this cart a good amount this brand is probably one of the few that i will actually finish the cart if it's not from a dispensary normally i just stay completely away from black market carts but these this is one of the only official brands um like a tko or something but i think these are a lot higher quality than tko this is a blue diamond this is an indica i believe this is not not one of the super flavorful carts but i kind of like that i like the more just natural like it tastes like butter wax or something it's not super flavored um but yeah there are literally at this point there are so many flavors there's a green box a blue box a red box um a white box i think and a gold one i can't remember all the colors but there are so many flavors um there's obviously they they've even done special flavors at this point like the sour patch kids or the wafers which i've done a review on both of those i'm a big fan of this blue diamond i might try more of the original flavors because they seem to be less um you know flavored and in general i'm an indica fan over a sativa or a hybrid just because that's the way i like to smoke i like to chill out you know but yeah and i'm halfway through this car and it is barely uh discolored at all it's still the original like maybe it's a tiny bit darker but um it still looks good no no burned cotton or anything like that because if you see if those little holes right there start turning black and if it's like leaking like darker fluid um usually at that point i just throw it away because it starts tasting kind of whack but i would definitely definitely definitely recommend these if you are not in a place or area where you can get dispensary cards i'd say this is about your best bet just make sure you verify the boxes there will be a qr code i believe which will bring up lab tests and stuff like that do not get um one of these if um it's not verified and on their social medias like on their snapchat they will post all the fake vendors because there are some fake vendors of these um they'll expose any instagram pages that are selling fake ones or anything like that um so definitely be careful but if you can find verified ones definitely worth it because these are some of the best carts out right now but thank you guys for watching i have a [ __ ] ton of videos like this uh mad cart reviews and edible reviews and stuff like that but yeah stay safe drop a sub goodbye", "kqigW35mDl0": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i got a cartridge review it's coming to you by sauced this is a live resin sauce cartridge the strain is skywalker the skywalker og but before we get into this let's do a nose dab i've heard people talking about it i haven't done one so we'll do a nose dab shoddy make it special i do got a load already loaded up of some cali kosher it is some dosey does frosting and if you guys want to see the review to that i've already shot it i just got to edit it and put it up it will be out in a few days so stay tuned for that okay let's get this ready cheers everybody get this shoddy oh [ __ ] cut the whole hella big oh well i'll make it work i'll make it work all right i'm going to take the nose dab out of the carta nebula edition the dosey does frosting by kelly kosher a nose dab into a shoddy here we go nervous never done one before all right not too bad clean that out later okay i thought that was going to be more difficult but it wasn't too bad okay so we got the sauced the skywalker the skywalker og by saust this is a hybrid it is coming to you at a 87 percent on the thc and a .2 on the cbd this is gonna run you forty dollars for the cart this is only a half gram forty bucks it is a all ceramic cart i have took a hit or two off of it because i wanted to see how it was it does have the seals on them i got a brand new battery let's get it on here and i did get this at manzanita in merced california it's a dispensary manzanita like the manzanita tree nose dab okay let's get into this cart cheers everybody the all ceramic carts are the way to go if you guys haven't ever had one before i highly recommend trying one out this is the skywalker og by sauced oh that tastes so [ __ ] good it's really clean tasting it tastes uh i don't think there's any added terps or anything it tastes just like the weed should taste it's really smooth it doesn't [ __ ] your throat up and it packs a hell of a punch i'm not gonna lie when you just after you take the first hit you're like oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] is solid i know that ursa does the all ceramic cars in 710 labs there's a few others that do the all ceramic if you can find the all ceramic do it because those metal ones you know the plastic tips they're just not as good seriously yeah this is that full spectrum so i really like the packaging it's kind of neat i was disappointed that it's only half a gram because i really like to get a full gram cart but i'm starting to go for quality now and this is some quality [ __ ] take another hit or two before i give you guys my review oh i stopped by a save mart yesterday and i got a couple craft beers i will be doing reviews of those shortly too i'm not gonna show them to you today but uh i picked up a cool ass magazine lebron james [ __ ] lakers it's a like a special edition magazine i thought i'd pick it up since i'm a [ __ ] super fan all right cheers hope you guys are having a great day out there smoking on something good not no [ __ ] like that last cartridge i [ __ ] reviewed that select that [ __ ] was boo boo it's really good tastes amazing it's so smooth and it does pack a punch that's exactly what i want in a cartridge gets me loaded great flavor and uh very smooth so okay we can calculate this up we'll make this a short one because i already know what i'm going to give this so price 40 bucks for a half a gram that is expensive but it's uh it's really [ __ ] good so it's expensive but it's [ __ ] good the the look of these carts are great this the sauce in it looks really [ __ ] good and they're the all ceramic carts they're they're [ __ ] they're very pretty so uh the great look the you don't get a smell of course the the smoothness is there it's hella smooth it doesn't fluff your throat up at all the flavor is amazing and the high is definitely [ __ ] there i really like the sauce carts this is the very first time that i'm trying them and the skywalker og is a hit i really [ __ ] like it so overall for the skywalker og by sauced i'm giving this cart an 8.2 you know what i mean it's a i don't really give cartridges like crazy high reviews and [ __ ] because it's not like weed or uh dabs to me it's you know so i'm giving it the 8.2 it's really [ __ ] good the only reason i wouldn't give it higher is because it's only a half a gram and they are pretty expensive but you get what you pay for it's definitely some quality product and i highly recommend it if you guys haven't tried it try it out you can get these at manzanita in merced california you could probably get them in a lot of other places sauced given at the 8.2 that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] so you", "f-HRDikFjyU": "what's up everybody so today we have buddies brand thc bomb whoa stupid fire bro i ain't gonna lie to you stupid fire the strains they've

peace", "OYzizoPgQZo": "[Music] [Music] try and make this right if you try to make this right what's a guy's simplistic hair fact with another well I'm just if you want you should always put someone biting your thing I dunno what's up guys simplistic so guys simplistic here back with another video if you can see or you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be a diamonds bear labs review but we got RJ eats you know I'm saying shout out to the homie and also tattoos by kaze if you guys haven't checked out the merch I'll also post got in the bond description below that is my homie right there and he does tattoos so if you're interested in the Modesto 209 area show you boys and love you know I'm saying I show you the back and I mean yeah yeah so yeah which is surprising that cos he actually went up to me and was like someone actually messaged him through Instagram through my videos and was like can I get one of these so that's pretty cool another thing I like to mention I'm not gonna probably mention it and then in like the next coming videos probably do a few more times but my merch is going to have a coupon code because it is my birthday month and if you enter March for all caps you get seven dollars off your merchandise so should be a good little discount for you guys but like I said I'm gonna mention it in probably like a few more videos because kind of getting annoying and now I've already did it like twice and I feel like it's a little bit repetitive but you know I'm saying if you want some gear get some gear if you don't okay no I'm sayin so we got some bear labs and just as like the other video I'm gonna have him open it and then imma film it with my camera that way I don't have to take off this you know right here is sherbert so right off the bat you could notice that that ninety seven percent total cannabinoids but just for those of you who think that that's THC it's not tht is actually on the top left right there no off 20 on the bone right there so it's actually 85 percent THC at low temperatures so right off the bat like from looks when she showed me it no diamonds don't mean like that means she's a little small so open [Music] this smell is actually like so I'm okay so with diamonds usually there is like barely any taste I've noticed because it's like I guess it's like THC a diamond I don't know what it's not really good though there lies always smells good and they see you know yes - Wow we're gonna reserve our judgment till we actually tried the damn thing you know anything but rather bat I'm gonna be using the utility and you know I'm saying we got the bubbler from brain fog er brain we do it gentlemen this start it already let's start reporting oh yeah is it it's gonna be for this actually no it's because there's no stabilization on there you definitely notice it instead of like on the camera [Music] yes so if you haven't already try to look for some extra videos it's kinda like extra videos from my channel you

cold and we're flipping the script today we're doing something we have never done before I am pleased to announce our very very first guest rody rosin aka Joey diamonds what's the deal thanks for coming pleasure to have you thank you pleasure to have you as our very first guest actually like I said we've never done it before but it's gonna be something we sit on you mentioned start implements is my new mentally startup at all yes today's all about rody Roz if you haven't seen that already Roby rosin rody Rossi somebody has and bonanza he brought gifts Rhode Island's finest garden rody rosin collab t-shirts trial run we got it all so some of these shirts right here will be pumping these out in the next few weeks and maybe think of some pretty sale order it's doing a little campaign we got some merchandise we got stickers so we're trying to roll out get the diamonds I've ever seen never seen anything like this number whatever shaped that's first for the community man around here UFC Octagon literally I won't tell your next to go octagon things yeah honeycomb to the dome I like that all right man let's get it written how we doing it so we starting off with a little warmup it's a member very flattered rosin I'm the Barry Slough member Barry's my favorite shape for any shape or form in Larry's not well obviously crazy the live loss is crazy the diamonds grew it what's good setting the record over here straight remember Barry's always finest Gardens they grow it we got it right here and only home diamonds so that's a druid row with rh- Gardens everyone knows about them of course then we got Mission Hill melts who washes the flour all right oh [ __ ] yeah so this is a Mission Hill he comes in he watches it he gives me some of that premium bubble ash full spectrum then I go from there I'll take that I turn into the honeycomb diamonds they're testing right around like 90% DHT oh [ __ ] yeah that's something not too many not too many companies around Lake 7ds high 60s right 64 and what's nice about these men the only clean diamonds the individually proportion solely you can take one of them and you know how much it dig and they each weigh like a point zero six grams okay so like you can go it's like easy to measure yeah I started just coming out couples and happy well like you know with the Terps once they soak up makes a little easier to break up spinning per usual toke tonic in the rig shout out talk tonic and yo we will write about the sour berries sour berries has a lineage from them if they have a berry sauce sour berries is fire no games started so when did you start when did you create rody rosin and winning this whole when did the whole idea behind us start what made you say this is what I want to do yeah so how I started I guess so rody rosin started from when I first began making extracts back in 2013 ok oh it was kind of like I used to solving these butane so it was back when like butane was you know being in the community and so I started in my experience through that I'll get some trim I blasted I guess an extract and I realized at that point like you know you got like this nice concentrated oil in a pure form right and for me I was a patient so I interested in the industry being a patient I got Lyme disease so I had some chronic pain that I needed to manage you know smoking flour the smoke itself was just you know it was hindering my life you know healing process for Lyme disease doctors you know too much smoke villages not healthy for me so you got a reaction from like a Dewar's puffer blunt like it it wasn't good I wasn't talking too much you know I mean I have like my sinus together stuff there's something like that you know just because of the line busy how it have these exaggerated responses to the smoke so I ended up going towards you know the - yeah you take one hit it's like smoking I hope you're good to go yeah it's all I needed so I took a little hit yeah realize how medicinal it was right it was working for me so I figured why not bring this medicine to the people around patients around me I'm sort of like to hear man it's all about so I started working with B&B consultant if you guys are familiar with that but they do they are they do medical cards around here over here that Warwick and I worked with him as patients and like he gave me some patients that were in chronic pain and you know from there kind of like develop and at one point I realized like hey I can go from using this solvent that having a solvent list by just going from rosin you just get in the buzz and just squashing it was like the main guys you're working with yeah so basically I mean the industry is real competitive there's no and having the best product out there is and pulling high quality stuff and you know I found myself you know working with our eyes finest Gardens they seem to have something like the most high quality high quality flower out there and I think we can also attest to that it's definitely this fire there's nothing better than pressing some high quality flower on that much and I've worked with LC problems they're a women-owned cultivator okay all right so they sell the VI Vancouver Island A's so press some of some of their stuff I work with them great people over there and but right now I'm just focusing with our eyes finest gardens and you know seeing what happens next in the industry more or less right right distinctly every other diamond looks like it's not uniformly shaped like that already right it's like that the only ones I see now perfect like octagon shapes you have any shape you want it yeah I mean I could go that route 100% I can make any any shape I want and that's something we're thinking about right now maybe getting something that represents Rudy rosin but yeah so each one of those honeycombs are point zero six grams so I mean it helps do consumer understand what the you know what they're consuming and I think that which is the first time I like other than even edibles right I have history edibles were like summer week and someone like ungodly strong wave and it's like it's like the pan tilted to the left and all the good cherry be like the ones to the top right a week and one that is leaning towards it's just the most ungodly [ __ ] edible and I mean be done and I mean that's good exactly that's what's good about this because it gives you like that better understand them [Music] in 2006 320 comme no people with 90 percent THC or even 70 percent THC rosin you know it's important to know what you know in your hand in their wedding cake in their purple chemistry imma let a good guy me too I love the guess I like somebody though it sounds like their staple but like the can for sure this it's like you know you can you can try this you can try that what pecans oh it's right there exactly so you been know you've been in the community sorry since since when I was medicated because I like Lyme disease before my patient card 2008 2009 yes right around when I started burning flour saying that 2008 it was like an eighth grade like that transition into my best on that kid so I'm that kid I smoke weed in like high school wrong with this [ __ ] without getting pulled over I should probably spend the money on it exactly did that right away I was like oh wait I can grow weed I was like we should probably do that and I did that right away he did push first tried cannabis back in like eighth grade but then I really started medicating it was a big gap in time where I wasn't using it and then towards the end of high school like made its way back around other guys this stuff actually works for some reason right right doctor job they were trying to beat me like all regards just a prescription medication I they shouldn't be given you know kid at my age right sprays you know whatever I know it's like you have to take the life that young it's your how old 27 how old were you when you found out this news that's legit when I in your whole life like when I take it when I like that and I had trouble for you know it was like so the b-17 like to remember that stage of my life and then to be like you have Lyme disease just again right you know I'm saying that's crazy I had Stage three heart so I was like it was going down it was going down dude I had like my hands were inflamed my angels were inflamed my nose and eyes were inflamed I couldn't I really couldn't move my hands it was that if you like my tics and [ __ ] I never found the tape what like that you know they said I got it from a tick and uh that's what they said yeah yeah do it I walk my dog and I was taking Matt takes off and I was like I gotta check neat oh hell yeah it's no joke so I started I got control of my health kind of how I didn't totally taken no cannabis instead of doing those prescription medications hell yeah I do the same thing I had emergency surgery on my stomach and I was like maybe 25 and I was in the hospital I know no idea why they [ __ ] cut me open sold me up did wherever the [ __ ] I had an ulcer and I was like literally poisoning myself but then when I got out he was like you gotta take this purple pill from life right and I was like like no like I was just like no way no what I can't even take I'm like I'm not gonna wake up everyone I'm gonna forget that I can never if I had to take birth control be pregnant already they're gonna say cuz I would never remember that pill that be morning I would just walk out and be like let's go you know just not in me to like wake up every morning and take a pill like that that was never gonna happen so like I took them cuz I knew I just got out of surgery but then as soon as I felt like I was healed I didn't even tell the doctor and then I I told I want to take this no more it was like don't take them for a week let me know let you go right now I don't know yet see ya who's like if you're good you're good I was like whoa haven't talked since it's been like [ __ ] five years that's what's good bro you know you get stronger you get out there they make the right moves can be so catastrophic dude so people don't realize it they just because it's like government approved that like it's okay that's the whole inception about do wheat itself from all the day to the hemp days where hemp was gonna overtake paper you know I mean when they and they shut that down to like literally now we're like CBD is threatening the health care system now they're trying to manage ourselves and how we trying to make savings if you can grow CBD on the value back watching the Sun like you know you're not you don't have to get tylenol or whatever the [ __ ] oh yeah I miss all that obsolete yeah I can just grow a tomato and eat a tomato I don't have to go to the supermarket same thing with CVD whose grow CBD and make your emotions from it whatever the [ __ ] you wanna make fun which is you know this concentrates aspect it's a big thing because they're realizing that it's a pure reform I mean you get rid of all the impurities all those botanical impurity you think about the clarity on these [ __ ] diamonds man I'm just hoping that I get the temperature right on my back it's gonna piss me off is keep cold piss me off yeah because the tha just brings a little bit higher like the portions are [ __ ] awesome too because like when I'm again getting a [ __ ] dab ready I'm like that's too much you got to put a little bit back this one's just grabbing you go don't go it's [ __ ] growers only cold collaboration with roadie rosin like I said we've never done it before here we go remember babies solve over B rosin solving this diamonds saw stuff was that cap a break I'm digging that here man that's a new rig - I like that that curly fry THCA there's a lot of people yeah yeah like normally people have lag on thta customs like stable like you get some rosin this flavor from the member berries which is always the best apologies comes back the way it Elita member parity look it's the perfect size you don't need that you need is a second guess how was that it's funky [Music] [Music] yeah so real quick you know just to inform the community about the uncle diamonds the way these are me there's a couple way make the diamonds you can make them by the jar text or you can make mechanical separation those are like the two two texts right now and the way these were made or mechanical separation and recombination so basically with what definitely Chinese to me right now and I'm like what's that what that is you literally get the rosin and you repress it so it starts from live rosin rosin high-quality flour so that's we get so that's good we just are that's a basis so they you got like 20 grams of like some some rods and high quality stuff to test around like 70 percent THC mm-hmm good daddy throw it in some like 25 micron screens double wrap it and make sure they're nice and safe and you go and you put it in the press and like it's this real slow meticulous process with like idle low temperature low pressure you sit there and you kind of just like allow the terpenes and cannabinoids the kind of like separate from one another the THC a crystallizes as like a place closed and the heat is applied to it and they're slowly closing the terpenes won't like push off to the side and like folded parchment paper and like kind of like collected turkeys into a separate jar which you got the terpenes you got the THC a you can kind of do another little magical process to it after and then you go and then we combine the terpenes with the Diamonds so so you do the KFC recipe the locked-up recipe you ain't tell me nobody and yeah very nice you're gonna keep that there's a lot there's a few things I wasn't even on yeah definitely yeah you know meticulous process and it takes like a great quality flour and I'm good material to watch just like when you grow flowers everything from the soil to the [ __ ] nutrients but everything has to be perfect if you want to get the best like is it different quantities you're getting out per restraints or yeah so like you know it's Oh princess you're gonna press like rosin you know and you press in like 10 grams of flour rosin you know each strain it's gonna give you a different percent yield like this one strain might yield twenty percent and you got yourself off ten grand you got yourself two grams you got one string that may yield 10% and then off 10 grams you got yourself one gram right so like that's the difference in like working with the different string in Yukon a half there yo put that into account calculate you know like you said finding that right string for some screens you like to work with I haven't won this whole time all right the time has arrived for the first time ever the 90 second burned down so rapid-fire questionnaire we're gonna ask the questions you're gonna answer them as quick as your [ __ ] possibly can just go home see your brain it

welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is turkey Tuesday episode 57 today are getting my hands on some diamonds some BHO sauce for the first time on the show I want to say this is the first time I've had like real-deal proper diamonds on the show this stuff is just like big giant super clear transparent boulders of THC a sitting in a really bright golden turf liquid and this is a butane extraction but yeah the only big differentiating factor I can I can really find between this stuff and the applesauce consistency is really as the the applesauce stuff is just like this but if someone were to get it dab her and just break down all the big rocks into the end of the liquid and stir it up you know it would be wouldn't really be that much different this stuff just looks really crazy this is a collaboration with retro wave as a local grower here in San Diego in the San Diego area he grows a lot of really really fire Girl Scout cookies genetics a couple like staples from his garden or like the dump truck this newer one is the the peanut butter breath which is what I'm reviewing today so this is a collaboration between West Coast alchemy and retro wave so West Coast alchemy is a like a diamond producer and he frequently collaborates with with different growers this is the first time I've seen a retro wave collaboration and I I saw this on Instagram and I was like oh [ __ ] that's cool that a you know local grower is collaborating with one of the more I think one of the more hyped and makers at least here California this West Coast aqua me stuff is serious gas guys the peanut butter breath is I believe it's a it's a genetic mix of avid Osito cut and OG Kush breath so dosey doe if you've never had it it's named after the you know the peanut butter Girl Scout cookie it does kind of have that uh let's say like a nutty but it is it's definitely got like some some creamy kind of peanut buttery funk to it especially if you've got like a really good pack and just like you know get a good smell of a whole bunch of dough so you know it definitely kind of has that impression the peanut butter breath is you know the introduction of OG Kush breath as a cross parent and yeah this stuff is like I'd want to say honestly even more peanut butter it's it's still very very gassy and I don't think that's necessarily the nature that concentrate I think just the addition of the OG Kush breath just really pushes it over the edge into that like funky just like peanut buttery but really still just like gasp gasp cookie concentrate and yeah this stuff is amazing serious looker this diamond sauce I'm sure by now you guys have seen on Instagram all the emili\u00b4s a countless but there's a lot of photographers that are taking pictures of like you know stacks of diamonds one photographer is really killing it in my opinion these days is uh things from Stein farm if you guys get a chance things from Stein farm is as a seattle-based photographer and he is insane on the the diamond macros and just his lighting everything is from from from a photographer to a photographer that guy is a on point with the diamond shots so if you want to check out some killer shops of diamonds maybe a little better than what I can do currently check out his page but yeah some sure I got some shots of this as well my on care for this show and yeah not not let down the Diamonds the West Coast alchemy diamonds are super transparent again that's I don't know if this really is so much a sign of quality of the diamonds but it's just when I when i th see a diamond is super clear like a like a diamond you only a piece of glass it's really really cool under the camera especially when it's kind of soaked in that Terp liquid the nose on this stuff again guys it's just peanut butter all day huge gasp cookie funk just right up in your face it's yeah it's really really good I've got a couple grams of this to really get a good impression of it and I went through it so fast this stuff is just kill so yeah huge thank you to retro wave who I got to personally meet and hang out with and get these samples from and yeah thanks to West Coast alchemy for running an absolutely fire concentrate I'm gonna go in on the first app here guys this is the West Coast alchemy retro wave peanut butter breath I haven't had my hand in the cookie jar today I'm not at all yeah the retro wave of West Coast alchemy collaboration the peanut butter breath diamonds does Cheers [Music] [Music] probably turn that nail up a little bit sometimes with these diamonds I've noticed you kind of got to turn the nail up or warm up the banger a little more depending on what you're using oh yeah killer and guys I mean really very very obvious to me that the source material used for this one is is just sound kill Just Ducky chirps super strong I wish I could say that it tasted like peanut butter but unfortunately I feel like you get more of the peanut butter impression on the nose a special shout-out to archived seed bag for bringing the dosey doe to the table cos I think I think I can say at this point that the dough C is probably my favorite cut of the cookies mainly because I think it's just a little more og leaning than the other ones like you know the sure bin the gelato the dough C for me is just yeah slaps it's got it's got more yeah more og this to it I guess you could say feels like it to me anyways and yeah this this concentrates got that dough see that dough see funk definitely excited to try out different flavors from I know they're not this isn't the only retro wave and westcoast.com a flavor I think there's the dump truck is out there and I'm not sure I'm sure what the other ones are but I'm going to find out the buzz from this guy's is it's it's I think I've described cookie buzzes a couple times on this channel of various concentrates but it's very cerebral Oh G for me is and and you got to kind of mention ODU and you talked about cookies because they're very very similar as far as lineage goes but the the og buzz for me is more subtle and you know it's more of that like traditional couch lock you know less less of a head high less of a cerebral effect and the cookie is still kind of I find especially in larger doses the cookies deliver that that funk that that og characteristic you know and as in regards to if you smoke enough of it it will lock you on the couch just like og well but cookies for me are way more like you know I can feel it in my spine you know like legitimately cerebral buzz it's very heady and I think that's and it's also compared to og cush cookies are very fast moving kind of like the gorilla for the grease monkey era viewed in the last episode cookies have that fast moving characteristic for sure and I think that's part of the the Durbin poison in there yeah the quality and the cleanliness of this concentrate definitely leads me to believe that you know most of these collaborations regardless of whether or not it's necessarily a retro wave collab from this company are gonna be really good I'm sure that the owner of this this company of West Coast alchemy has a good eye for high-quality source material and and yeah that that's no slight on retro wave he'd grow some of the most fired cookies in town without a doubt very excited to get my hands on this and yeah just even more so because it's a it's a local grower here in San Diego who's absolutely killing it growing a really high quality indoor flowers so yeah if you get your hands on some rich aurilla flower I think you will enjoy yourself and I am definitely enjoying myself with this this West Coast alchemy diamond Club guys gonna go in on my second DAP here this is the peanut butter breath again the West Coast alchemy and retro wave collaboration cheers guys [Music] [Music] yeah hmm I've come on an off relationship with cookies but lately I feel like half the stuff I smoked this is some in some form or fashion a cookie mix or some kind of some cookie something you know if you haven't tried if you're in California and you haven't tried like really good Girl Scout cookies I know some phenotypes can usually be found at jumbo boys in LA here in San Diego if you can get a hold them you know some retro wave rare Terps is another one growing super fire cookies yeah it's just it's an amazing genetic that's you know she and Dan have talked about it a good deal it's like you know it's it's not necessarily played out but it's it's like at the peak of its popularity it feels like right now like it's [ __ ] everywhere that's good cuz it's gas you know yeah love love me some cookies and yeah if you haven't tried the Girl Scout cookies like is what I was getting to earlier lost my train of love you're missing out big time totally give it a try especially if you live here in California especially if you like og I know I was gifted some nugs of what I think an ex grower from cushko to shoot a couple days ago and it was so nice to get finally get my hands on some good OG I haven't seen just in flower is just so nice to see real-deal like OG gas because it's so diluted nowadays but a genetic that's not I mean at least to me not dilute it as is the cooks and the cookies and this this peanut butter breath is a prime example some really strong phenotype selection and just yeah the the flavor on this one guys is it is it's not like I said you're not gonna get like you know a spoonful of peanut butter taste off of this it's a bit more gassy cookies but it does have a definite nuttiness to it and the nose is very much peanut butter yeah it smells like peanut butter cookies it's funky yeah I can't get enough of this stuff so diamonds are a funky one I don't know if and this is you know this is just personal opinion but diamonds are kind of inconsistent as far as a dabbing experience goes because you know the sauce that's like apple sauce and and for me my favorite consistencies are like sugar and the old school kind of cake batter and like crumble I feel like those are the best for Pho anyways but the the photogenic nature these diamonds and and just really just honey yeah and the photogenic nature like they're all over Instagram it looks super cool and they're melting inside of a finger I think that honestly that's that's what's led to their popularity more so than the the actual experience of dabbing them which I find to be a little bit inconsistent it's like the you know you you're never gonna get the exact same balance of THC a crystals and turf's because you're just chipping away at a giant rock you know in some of these these jars are just one giant boulder of thca which is really dope to have in your pocket like you know just this huge rock of THC a surrounded by really high-quality Turks but you're never gonna have the exact same size you know rock of THC and amount of turps on your dabber so every time it's going to be a little more Turkey dab you got saying you know a little more of a THC a flavor and there's definitely a sweet spot to be had and I think I think there's something to be said for extractions that focus on finding that perfect balance of THC a and in Terps either way this is some amazing stuff guys gets you really really stoned no doubt the the potencies are there and when you do get a good mix of the diamond turps and and the you know the actual rock itself the flavor experience is on point yeah you just make sure make sure you get a little bit of liquid on there because in my experience and I think you saw my THC a crystalline it's one of the more viewed reviews I've done and it THC a by itself is kind of bland tasting so like it's really easy with something like this to just take a giant rock of THC a and just slam it in and get kind of a tasteless dab because you didn't make sure you know to at least roll the rock around in the liquid and make sure that it's coated in turfs before you smoked it because just smoking just the rock by itself yeah sounds sketchy smoking just the rock but so the THC a crystal by itself is not the most flavorful and therefore not the greatest buzz in my opinion I think there's a lot to be said for turps and how much they affect the quality of your high and the turps and this stuff the turkic wood is just like incredibly transparent and really really loud this is a extraction done with skill without question yeah looking at again looking forward to trying more of these flavors yeah guys I think that's a I think that's gonna wrap up this review I am definitely super baked off of the peanut butter breath from West Coast Appa me a retro way of thanks again to retro wave for getting these these samples to me for review this has been episode 57 reviewing the West Coast alchemy retro wave Dimond pho sauce collaboration if you see these concentrates around I think they're only available in California don't hesitate to pick up and grammar' to super flavorful high gasp cookie funk on these loans guys and and yeah I'll be back in another week or two just take it easy thanks for tuning in to the CCC portal [Music]", "Xr26WRfCdgA": "YouTube what's up cuz you

these are nice [Music] it is clean it just died Brown's row [Music] only do the trick I would definitely grab a mess if you never did down into the Fords it's a definitely you know trying if your dad were and never did diamond to definite power tribe but if you're looking for taste it's just not there and last okay Cresco got the diamonds with the Terp sauce no that's a different ballgame you get the taste because you're getting a taste from the turf but I know the name is from the strain but there's no no tasting them down definitely take another dogs and gives you a little sweat up usually

them go ahead and go check them out but today we got this hurricane this is coming to you at 30 and a half percent on a thc one percent on the cbd for a total cannabinoids of 36 and a half percent take a look at the buds they look tremendous nice dense buds and like always if you want to see an up close picture of the bud check it out as you can see there they look tremendous they're really dense they smell great and how you get the slurry cane is you cross dosy does with purple punch and that's how you get this hurricane i did get this at blue fire dispensary in merced california and it is going to run you 36 for the eighth i do got a bong load packed so without further ado let's get into it oh and this is an indica dominant by the way so cheers okay first initial thought it was really smooth has great flavor it's one of the the best flavors i've had in a while like well not in a while because i've had some great ones lately but this is a really great flavor and it gives me that lung expansion that i'm looking for in an indica when i was breaking it up it was pretty sticky too so off the first hit i do really like it but like always two for the review they also started coming out next green wave comes out with uh they got cartridges now too they're 100 sauce carts no distillate or any of that [ __ ] i actually have this hurricane cartridge right here so i'm going to review the weed for you guys first and then in a few days i'll review the cartridge and i'll tell you how close it is to the actual strain of weed of theirs let's get the stealth smoke out of there i actually had the pleasure of meeting the the owner of next green wave at blue fire dispensary at a promo and he was a really nice guy shout out to mike he was a cool ass dude so it's a great company if you guys haven't tried next green wave i highly recommend them the everything that i've reviewed from them so far i've really enjoyed i don't think i found a strain yet that i didn't like and so far off the first hit this hurricane is no exception whew like always let's go this isn't a tall can it's 19 ounces so it's a little under a tall can it's almost a talk and shoddy hope you guys are having a great day out there [Music] only a few more two more weeks though tell uh thanksgiving people get your [ __ ] together not much time then christmas these ones are harder because it's like you know almost two beers at once but cheers everybody [Music] that was cold shake it off yeah that [ __ ] was cold excuse me my [ __ ] dogs barking outside oh that one's a little rough on the stomach it's all right i can handle it i'm a veteran let's get this second one in two for the review hope you guys are smoking on something good out there not no [ __ ] oh let's go let's hurricane my next green wave okay second hit down same verdict great flavor very smooth and it gives you that [ __ ] that lung expansion i'm looking for in a good indica where i know that it's hitting me where you gotta like catch your breath you know after the hit a little bit like solid all right let's start calculating this [ __ ] price at blue fire dispensary in merced california where i got this it was 36 dollars for the eighth it's a great [ __ ] price the smoothness is totally there the flavor is amazing the uh yeah flavor's good the smoothness is there and the high the high is [ __ ] great the longer i'm sitting here the more baked i'm getting this isn't a [ __ ] strain at all i highly recommend this hurricane by next green wave so overall i'm gonna have to give it the 8.6 it's a really [ __ ] good strain it's up there with some of the best that i've tried this year if you guys see it in your local dispensary i highly recommend trying it and picking it up they also have the gmo cherries um the garlic grove and a bunch of other strains i've tried so many uh strains by them they're really a good company so i'm giving this hurricane my next green wave the 8.6 so i hope you guys try it that was my review hope you enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town", "-CUt-lv2upQ": "hi guys it's 4:00 here today with our staff will diamond miner you can see this insert has eight different shelves it comes standard with these crystallizing dishes there are 100 millimeters around 100 million diameter just it right onto the Shelf comes with these slick pads to keep it from moving as you can see when I tilt it it doesn't want to go anywhere so you can also fit some mason jars on if you like these are four ounce wide mouth mason jars 15 per shelf if you're trying to do different mixtures or testing with different strains so I'm going to lower this shelving unit into the spool all right after it's in there we have our top cap to put on top it comes standard with a nitrogen port right here what the jig fit in there's a sight glass in the middle a pressure gauge and that pressure relief this pressure leaves adjustable just by turning this you can set it prior to entering your material I still have to do a little bit of plug and play with it different pressures with nitrogen I was trying to put this gasket on here put the cap right on top and even though we're not using much pressure a lot of people tend to use under 10 psi even we're still going to use these high pressure clamps the roof system is rated for 100 psi so you can see right here there's the outlet for your jacket there's an inlet at the bottom and you can run your liquid through the outside to keep the whole vessel at a certain temperature throughout the duration of your my name alright so you can see in the cyclist here you can see your top container any diamonds that start to form you'll be able to watch them through the sight glass I'm gonna show you how to take out this rack to take off the top right so while the diamonds are forming it's recommended not to move the Machine at all so just set it leave it and then come back in a little while maybe even two weeks or so and

tobacco or vaping products which i think is totally fine so you have to be 21 to buy tobacco or vapes you have to be 21 to flip to gamble you have to be 21 to drink and you don't have to be 21 to join the army and go get kilt so remember that and here we go so we're gonna be doing a glow review and I got a couple of a couple of glows to review this time we got some Callie gold and some Elliot ultra

out the vid so I definitely wanna give you a shower I appreciate that brother and here we go this is Callie gold oh let's go so Kelly go says relaxation bars max depression relief asthmatics pain relief is maxed happiness is relaxed insomnia relief it's max and that sounds awesome is if this can put me to sleep that would be just the best it says oh any my magnifying glass 92 1.8 as usual smells really good it definitely has a very earthy herbal aroma not really candied or sweet have you tried Glo extract singing of you guys out there or gals let me know what you think of them I'm gonna be starting this off my tank off at 6.5 and see how we go from there here we go this is a Kelly go it's max - just so you know if Joe definitely tastes good turn it down another notch or two because I found that these Kelly goals are a little bit different than the tanks they don't need a higher temperature the bernam so anything both certain temperature just Lisl without the taste any work and more tea fans out there shout out your boss Rick and Morty quo or catchphrase in the comment section below I am a huge lubba dub dub fan with consent all right so I'm wailing on it it's the yummy it's really good I like that one so that is Kelly go I think the one that I liked that was least light was the it was the cushy Dalek I I liked it but Margaret was not a fan so she hated it as you guys see Eddie Murphy on SNL the last night that Yuri praised his old and I'm old so I remember when Eddie Murphy like before he did all that Nutty Professor and just trash not trash but like more towards kids and he used to be way hardcore and he did hardcore it last night and it was awesome sorry about that I think I kiss new phone will be doing a video on that so the other one is la ultra that reminds me yeah I just got I just got a new phone today it is called a I can't pronounce it I'll tell you about that when I get the box it's got a lot of vowels in it but it's super huge just got like a 6.8 screen and we'll see how the video comes out a little bit later so this is la ultra indica says you know it 92 1.8 let's see it says relaxation is max stress relief is just shy of being max pain relief is more than halfway which is always awesome happiness is full barred and then it says euphoria is maxed out so let's go a little more heat on that again this content is not intended for children so if you're watching this and you or a child beat it go watch telly tell these or something Blue's Clues paw Patrol or something like that oh no scram oh this one this one is compared to Kelly couch this one is much lighter ooh so like oh that's so good so this one's much more it has a lighter elements a fragrance but it's definitely a lighter vape then be Kelly got this so I would compare the other one it's more dinky skunky and this one's more Christmassy tree yeah there you go one more Christmas tree flavor you know what I'm talking about so Oh make sure you like comment

pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't

what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake

guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get

that poor boy and look at that but it's so dense that's nice very nice um another subscriber asked me yesterday how come nobody asked me to smoke blunts with you guys the reason why I don't smoke blunts is because it's not enough action it'll be a lot more talking ok let's say I roll blunts lighter blood I'm smoking so I'm just sitting here smoking with y'all in just like so here talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking see is not enough matching so with the bomb have to make sure my balls clean and the whole time I'm doing this I can talk which means that I'm in action while I'm talking to say you put ice in the bomb and then you get your lighter out then you break up the bud then you pack the bomb and then there's a big-ass cracking my thing right there I don't know if y'all can see that let's see if we get a clear shot yeah I see that crack some big ice crack right there yeah you can see it now anyway Tommy tuna bowls I just broke one of these just before I started this episode I moved my iPad and it was sitting on top my iPad to hit the ground you know how fragile these are and this one's cracks from cleaning it so maybe we'll get another good smoke out if I still have two more but let's go ahead and get into some slur became you can call it let me stop [ __ ] monetize run my [ __ ] y'all heard me you guys we are so close to a thousand circles let's hurry up and get there y'all then I can do some live videos the only thing about about doing live videos is that they don't have a chance to to go over the videos which you got you know to make sure it's it goes it goes with Community Guidelines so when you do a lot video I can't smoke on a lot of video I can't smoke weed I could smoke a blunt or live video because that's like into a cigar and a nobody really tripping but if I can't smoke a bomb or the live video I tried it before did I try it with I can't remember I tried it with you too but I know I tried it with tick tock I did it with Teague talking while I was in the middle of my video like they was watching my [ __ ] while I'm in the middle of this video the video just stops and it says your games Community Guidelines and I'm like wow what the [ __ ] am i doing just sitting and smoking so if I was sitting there smoking a cigarette it wouldn't be against community Collins if I was sitting there just slamming some liquor wouldn't be against Community Guidelines both of those are legal if I smoke some weed it goes against community college guidelines and it's legal let's get up in here y'all let go very gassy tastes very gassy who slurve okay babies look so good here look at the inside of it did you guys inside stop look at the inside is Bud wow that's just from the piece that I just broke off that is quite lovely looking indeed if I do say so myself don't you guys think that's lovely not at all you guys know what i'ma say huh because I say just about every episode ah I hope y'all slept like kings and queens last night because once again I slept like a frickin King can you guys believe that I wake up like this every [ __ ] morning every morning I wake up like this I mean when I open my eyes up there's no there's none of that when I'm laying in bed when I poke my eyes oh here's me opening my eyes up in the morning oh yeah let's go let's get it brush teeth wash pants come here do whatever else I got to take a piss things shake you know I'm saying I'm just I don't know I guess I'm always excited and feeling blessed to be waking up in the morning you understand what I'm saying so I made a video yesterday in it it sounded prejudiced I made it on tik-tok but it wasn't meant to be sounding prejudiced and I explained it before I said this is gonna sound prejudiced but it's not meant this way I said why is it that black people is always on white people's minds why do why do they feel like they have to always pay attention to us to make sure the see what we're doing with the phone in their hand light up the barbecue it like they're just waiting to call the [ __ ] police owners in this guy came on and said because you guys are known for stealing and killing I said wow that's [ __ ] up you guys know that that's all media propaganda that black people stealing kills anyway I said I said because black people are known for stealing and killing I said white people has stolen more and killed way more people in fact you guys stole a whole race of people but you know the media said oh the only thing you see in the media is black people is white people shooting black people this is all you see man so I don't understand how Caucasian or white people can say that that black people are violent they tell us not to live in the past as far as thinking of slavery and stuff but they're living in the past as far as thinking us as violent you know the biggest room in the world is room for improvement and you don't think that as a race that we have been proved from that stereotypical attitude that y'all have placed upon us as being violent and indeed we're not violent in thieves we're pretty much the same in fact you guys were made from us that medicine [ __ ] the crazy thing is that two black people can make a white baby but to white people cannot make a black baby the original people on the planet were were people of color I'm not gonna say they're black because I don't believe they were black I believe they were like I can't think of the name of it but [ __ ] I can't think of the name of it but it wasn't black there were the closest to black so you know I'm saying they were up there were black people at that time but it's more like Bret to brown skinned people but anyway I got sidetracked y'all I'm sorry it just upset me that the guy hadn't had the audacity to say that we are known for for stealing and killing it just it baffled me it's like wow we're sitting here watching the news of all these people just randomly shooting black people just randomly killing unarmed black people and he had the audacity to say that we are more violent than we still and kill Wow but I'm sure you guys I am NOT prejudiced once a racist because you guys know it'll research yourself I'm not gonna go into it black people by definition cannot be racist we can be prejudiced but we can't be racist prejudice and racism is pretty much the same damn thing but we can't be racist because of our social standing anyway where that sounds like negativity on my page I don't want that [ __ ] on my page that [ __ ] out here we are smoking some slurry cane baby amen you got to get all your homies and all your friends and come on and subscribe to the channel man and hit that post notification bell so they don't miss any of these fire ass videos man because now I'm telling weave right up on a thousand we right there y'all we less than a hundred to a thousand let go tell me what like doing it let go I know you guys are sitting on getting it brother he calls not one time to hear what the hell just happened I'm gonna get y'all money anyway no all right so let's go ahead and give this up a flavor critique because I don't think I need any further ado with that flavor critique so on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] Tim being a good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of slur Akane we're gonna give slur Akane the flavor critique of eight eight it's a strong eight there's nothing to be you know offended about it's a strong it's a nice eight it's two days no it's a good eight men some nice strong eight I would say mid eight the flavor is good it has a there's a slight burn on the back bottom of my throat I do taste a slight hint of berries in my mouth even for some reason the tip of my tongue is feels like it's slightly known that could be from something else but um yeah it's a pretty good flavor man definitely deserves every bit of that ate it's excellent what I've recommended to my friend hey if y'all haven't tried slurring can't go on and get on any she'll get some slur Akane in your life okay this is quite tasty I don't know about the berry taste but it tastes like it tastes like a thousand different weeds to me you know it's saying like there's so many different ways of tastes just like this the berries is so so my Newton so small that you can barely taste it you have to actually you have to actually taste you know get your taste buds in check my taste buds are in lemon because do you guys realize how many [ __ ] exotics I've smoked for you guys in the last three months in the last three months I've smoked no less than a hundred exactly 100 different exotics for y'all that's 100 different cannabis I've smoked over 150 different strains of exotics for y'all since I've opened up this channel and I think that's pretty [ __ ] amazing you guys that's a lot of different exotics you know I've never smoked I've never smoked this many different strains my whole entire life up into this point I've smoked the most strains in my whole life this year between last year and this year when I breathe out my nose is like a diesel II add easily taste like petrol like gasoline you know but it's real mods like almost an undertone it's quite nice still eight still deserves every bit of that eight and it burns slow too you us this is the little snapper bowl there's still a little green in there and I've been hitting this mug y'all I've been hitting this year you believe I do expect more from the hollow perhaps this is a creeper but um I do expect more from him what's the name like slur Akane I mean I should be completely baked right now I do feel hi and I do feel it creeping up and it's right behind my eyes that's it that's crazy because usually usually the high brains hit me right across here but this one's like I can feel it actually in both places I feel it more so behind my eyes but I feel a light bit on my forehead this is my high region you guys you know for um for exotics because most exotics are either had highs or just somewhere in this area for me I've never I I don't think I've had an exotic it's been so long since I've had out of cannabis that make that I got a body high off of I don't really like those I think the last time I had that was with that mango cush and remember I tell you I was telling you guys about that mango cush I don't like that she that she just put your ass to sleep randomly like you be smoking in you guys pass the blunt next thing you know you're waking up like you know what not just smoke it what the [ __ ] just happens that's some they should call that alien weed or so because I feel like I've been abducted every time I smoked that [ __ ] mango Kush dispensary great of course so have they opened up the public with you guys right yet a lot of people think that they opened up too soon but I don't know what what too soon would be you guys gotta realize it's like this um this this pandemic is like let's say it's like a can let your body with like the job situation it's like every day the cancer eats at your body and that's the way everybody not working was eaten at the United States economy every day was eaten at that [ __ ] every day we were getting less and less and less I personally I don't even feel like this is the United States anymore you guys I feel like this is something else I don't feel patriotic I don't feel like waving a [ __ ] flag in fact it's like burning a [ __ ] because it's like this hasn't felt like the United States for me for like [ __ ] man it's been a while man I would have to say it did you had to start before Trump but it really started really started pouring on with Trump and don't get it wrong you guys although I don't like Trump because I told you this before the American did never need a businessman running we don't need a businessman when we need his military [ __ ] running since we always at war [ __ ] but but Trump is like I don't know it seems like he's getting smarter or he's like paying attention more or he's starting to catch on to the presidency because now it looks like he's trying to do his [ __ ] job except for this [ __ ] Obama gate [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that man this [ __ ] you know what I really think that [ __ ] Odetta Donald Trump is sexually attracted to Obama I swear on everything I think he's sexually attracted to cuz that's all he talks about he up he lays awake at night thinking about Obama man thinking about what he could say about Obama because he wants Obama to see his response is he what he's saying about him he wants Obama to respond back because that's the only response he's gonna get for Obama you guys got to understand Eagles don't don't hunt flies man Obama's the eagle Trump's the fly Eagles do not hunt flies man Obama's just like Nikko here with that shitty head never to call Obama classless you know what I have to say one thing I'm a not a stood behind everything Obama did Obama was he was a snake just like the rest of the other presidents but I did respect him for being the first black president and that [ __ ] was one classy president that you know what that was the most swaggy classiest president we've ever had in the history of presidency he may not have done the best job I think he done a good job but he does gotta realize whenever but he says that Obama's [ __ ] up and he done some fucked-up [ __ ] but you gotta realize is who we follow behind he came behind Bush Bush [ __ ] up the whole country oh that's enough talking baby let's get in here I don't talk so much I forgot to pack the bowl he's going on man you hide that's what it is you hiding that's right peg this really got a few more minutes and mess with job we're gonna put a little so I think one episode I'm gonna have to deal with y'all with me smoking a blunt just to show you all what blunts do to me it will mix it up so we want to do a lot of talking even though I'm doing a lot of talking now we'll mix it up I'm not gonna let the count on the bag because I already got an idea of how the episode is going to go but um it's gonna be when I run when I run out of when I run out of exotics when I don't have any more exotics and I don't have room for another video or I don't have another day's video around so when I don't have another day's video round that's when I'll do it because you know to make a video you know I'm saying I got to make a deal it's my job y'all work with me baby work Whitman that was kind of weak we need to kill her yes how come they're the businesses that they are opening our businesses that I really don't give a damn about I don't give a damn about over up Noah restaurants that made me spend money but I do get there by that goddamn gym open up the gym okay guys we're go ahead on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that good [ __ ] of the high critique of slur akkanee we're gonna give us an equal amount of numbers that we gave it for the flavor we're gonna give it an eight we're gonna give it a high eight because the flavor is definitely ma Stephanie there y'all we got to get an air game nickel true it deserved every bit of that eight they got a golf clap for the eight even call you devil eight slur claim or eclaim slur Akane oh yeah okay I appreciate you guys stopping by as always to the new subscribers welcome to the family

real senior stoner back at you welcome to the diamond discussion that's right today we're gonna have a very special discussion under magnification we have with us today our magnifying glass lit magnifying glass apologize for the light what we're going to do today under light is we're going to examine different types of diamonds and talk about them let's get started first we're gonna use and discuss excellence diamonds these are and will all be of the first batch california-based diamond manufacturers the excellence brand these are made in March they have a serial number on them all kinds of information about the backs because in California everything has to be tracked seed to sale let's take a look inside oh my goodness well when you get these under glass under magnification it's a different deal you can really look at the glistening you can almost see the terpenes inside so this is the excellence brand comes packaged in a glass jar the bottom of the box is a very interesting thing because on the bottom of the box you can actually see inside that's pretty cool thing another of my favorite brands is southern cow extracts this is Kiwi pie they call SoCal divers this is another one Kiwi pie that gives you the batch number the date package the THC content all kinds of great information comes packaged in a frosted glass labeled on the bottom with what is in their container and let's look under magnification and talk about it also wow this is a little different this has got a little bit of sauce going on I'm not a big fan of sauce but now that I'm doing real dab break it's okay you'll see inside there that it's spread out over a wider area not just the big rocks that we saw in the orange one okay this is Kiwi pie but SoCal dabbers I can attest to the fact that it's extremely tasty we also have violet black water og banana sorbet I'm sampling these to see which one I'm gonna go deeper on neon lights these are all individual grams and double train-wrecked so these are the two brands excellence and SoCal divers I also contract with a grower I think I've discussed with you all and within that I've ordered the following la cush cake in a custom blend oh my goodness Wow these are in fact true diamonds if you can see them glistening over there so this is the la quick take you know every one of these is gonna taste a little bit different so I'm gonna pick a few to dive with you all once I get this display mr. nice guy THC diamonds you all know the brand or the I should say the strain of weed mr. nice guy what I did was I asked for specific things specific ways and I'll talk about that in a second each selection besides the odor being different the texture is different you'll see in a second these are each two gram containers of these diamonds now we're going to go to larger containers we're going to go to five gram containers and I order a very specific type of diamond the next one's gonna be cold dry diamonds and can any of you guess why I use dry diamonds that's right for the Jimmy joints these are my five gram bottles of dry diamonds and on the inside you'll see that they're already sifted they're dry so they'll crumble very well into a joint and then these are my custom gorilla glue number four diamonds I buy these in chunks you can see the chunks kind of rattling around down there so what we've now explained to everybody is there's a lot of different kinds of diamonds out on the market okay and it really depends the flavor the tert profile that you're looking for what you're going to get they're all different and everybody has their own preference everybody likes a different type of diamond that's true we're gonna do right now is we're gonna try La Push cake la quick kick that's the one that is really shiny if you can see the glistening and we're gonna pack it onto the Rio let's go for it all the way what do you say we'll pack it onto the Rio let's go and get a dab speed and take a nice bit of the dad dust if you will boy it's really fluffy I like these lighter diamonds sometimes that aren't so dense like a stone you know I mean like like a real piece of jewelry no the lighter ones are sometimes easier to deal with but let's see how it performs in the machine light off here we go throw them else down well bubbling very nicely let's give it a roll right there boy that was tasty let's finish that up one thing about diamonds Wow they are strong they are strong now we've gotten really good about q-tipping after every use IQ tip the Banger they have to every hit I'm getting better at it so I hope you enjoyed this discussion on diamonds diamonds are from 79% to 97% the purest form of THC a you can ingest the reason I have these in different ways is I have different flavors I like different textures the dry diamonds to go into Jimmy joints the regular diamonds to go into a dab or a pen or an earache so there really a variety of diamonds out there now the other thing you need to look at with diamonds is the cost you can get them you can get diamonds for $40 diamonds or you can get diamonds for $100 you need to be really careful who you buy them from where they're made and how they're made a lot of knockoff diamonds on the market if you remember a thing called pyrite that was fool's gold and in the Old West fool's gold made many a ghost town so don't

Rob here so today we're going to be talking about premium quality concentrate now Justin but ya know premium quality cannabis this is drip wax company makes fantastic products and I'm talkin like you buy it and you lab it so long you forget you have it like this stuff is some potent batter let me get a close-up for you guys now I don't know batter is made with pH over BHO so nice and oily if I touch it it'll it's like slimy so I can't touch with my fingers it's not like shatter stuffs like gold but yeah I tell you guys how I taste rips what the high is like I got this stuff for $33 a gram it's moved it's off of Cave Creek and Thunderbird area in Phoenix yeah this stuff is pretty bomb I haven't bought drip before it usually pretty broke when it comes to buying dabs but this stuff man I'm gonna try to find a deal when it's buy one get one free cuz it's like forty dollars a gram normally they have stuff there it's actually $82 gram this is the baseline stuff they make they have different tiers that like here here but yeah a drip it's got some amazing shape probably the best I've ever taken from there I'm getting that nice orange crazy-ass hair going on come back all like Amazon rainforest bird alrighty trip oh I should probably tell you what straining says guys wow slur Akane indica nice nice nice concentrates all right [Music] it's like the cleanest dab ever feels so good on my body like it's got like these nice warm chills [Music] stay tuned further wax review today peace out", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "ny3K_VxtaXM": "what's up guys welcome back to my channel we have another lit video with our friends edwin and flo what's up everyone we're gonna be reviewing ursa it's my very first time um trying out this very brand we have the concentrate sour diesel and liquid diamond cartridge which is purple valley grape the name it just sounds so like purpley and like i don't know i just messed with my whole vibe and [ __ ] um we're basically just gonna be chilling back um smoking this reviewing it they've actually already tried it out it's my first time i really like the packaging it's like purple and it reminds me of like galaxy type of [ __ ] you know for sure yeah um today we became crop owners i wish we could all show you i know we literally all bought crosstalk yeah they got the white colors and i got the blue one we picked up some candles yeah that was crazy though yeah that was so how long did we wait it was like 30 30 45 minutes yeah for sure it was a while though it got a lot longer once we left in total we all picked up like 50 candles total for a little more for sure yeah the deals though for real they were ten dollars each yeah we had to it was like he said that he wasn't going in mind with like grabbing some but they ended up getting eaten i ended up getting so i kept showing her something she didn't like any of them and i was like i want them so i ended up buying all the ones that she didn't like so she's like you got to put them in your studio instead of our room that's fine like i'm with it that's funny what are you guys favorite candles comment down below do you guys like candles as well i feel like she was talking about how earlier she never imagined when she was younger that she was going to be waiting like a candlelight you know excited yeah like things that you never thought you would be so happy for like i never honestly thought i was going to be owning some crocs too like when they first came out like i'd be like what's the hype about like peripheral they're not comfortable though they are yeah we have it on the red setting which is the lowest setting so we're gonna get flavor of that concentrate very excited yeah i'm excited i always like trying new products it's always fun um i've never i'm not gonna lie and say every product i've tried has been the best because there's been some concentrates where i'm like oh [ __ ] no what about you guys huh cheers everybody she's going in on the dab yeah with the loud guys she wasn't playing like she pulled up with some fire all legal clean brandon stuff congress not playing with no like we hop boxed earlier before there's two huh even like a seven gram joint anna blantee pulled up with the blunt how did it taste it didn't taste like purpley did it taste purple um it tasted more on the turkey side for me yeah for sure oh it's sour diesel my bad yeah you're expecting like a grape type flavor yeah i really was i'm like damn but it wasn't bad i think you'll get a flavor dude you're like i'm getting all the wreaths for sure i'd be doing the same [ __ ] can't waste wax it's too good to be wasted you know we're gonna start unopening this up so we're not just looking at edmond and just staring at me he's all getting high by himself cheers guys i was telling them that this cartridge reminds me of that um push-up candy for real flo says she's going to attempt to 20 seconds she's like nah now here you can try this there's no way it made it 10 seconds yeah it was good i got as [ __ ] does it taste like grape or anything like that like no this was more for sure on turkey terp for sure yeah but yeah we're gonna go eat right now bw [Laughter] i'm dead yeah we have we haven't ate all day literally from five to five we haven't eaten and we've been um smoking since like 12 or whatever i guess we got a pretzel but like we didn't even finish like a snack you know yeah like a little pre breakfast oh that scene has a 20 second blinker that's insane that's crazy that is insane i've actually attempted it it's not fun to do this more like uh i gotta take out the camera and do it here and then it's not like i would do it every day yeah and we were just talking about it like you don't do a blinker honestly every single time you have the chance like more of a challenge type of [ __ ] yo this thing's getting high for sure though i think we haven't smoked in a while the cartridge i feel like it tastes like a dab yeah that's just like really dab like uh-huh it has like i thought it was gonna be fruity some type of foodie but for sure it gives me like more terpenes yeah concentrate um vibes like a dab you know you're smoking like some strong [ __ ] for sure just based off the flavor yeah you can take another dab pack it up yeah they're gonna be back to back that was the last one to take it down still don't have to get down damn you ready to eat yeah i'm ready to eat hello like i said we're about to go eat um i think i i need to hit the ursula a little more but i actually liked it um i wasn't bad because i felt like the cartridge definitely gave me that like liquid diamond effect like a dab effect i felt like it was a [ __ ] dab out of a cart um so i would recommend and i like the packaging too i like products that go all out with their packaging and are just creative it's just not a whatever packaging yeah focus the whole universe vibes for sure yeah it just makes you like feel chill too but we're gonna go eat

purchase that one or whatever and until next time peace out", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know

present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing

don't they molly shannon shannon review straight from a jew so that should be good right it rhymes i i trust things that rhyme except dr seuss because he's today's strain is gmo it stands for garlic mushroom and onion everybody always gets afraid when i say garlic mushroom onion but it's nothing to be afraid of because it's the dankiest most amazing constraint personally for me i like it when i go on to the my insa website uh they say that it's also known as gmo cookies it's a cross between two legendary strains chem dog d and girl scout cookies which everybody loves girl scout cookies someone named skunk master flex made gmo so that makes a lot of sense is very stinky everyone in print is talking about it something smells like weed leafly.com you can check that here it will tell you what i should be expecting from the gmo strain all right oh you know what i love about these tubes see it already smells i popped that open and i'm like skunk master flex right off the bat this stuff tastes strong okay i'm strong i'm wrong you're getting that like almost garlicky taste in the back of your throat ooh my titties falling down dude he's falling down i want to touch that gmo all the way in the back of my throat so the thca as you can see my eyes are starting to lower uh oh so i'm going to put the little chart right here as you can see it is much more indica this strain is really uh it is in high demand it goes very quickly so i'm happy i got one and i'll just feel like luxurious smoking by weed i would give it a 10 out of 10. didn't even get that [ __ ] ding ding ding ding because the taste is great the smell is really strong you know that you are going to get stoned from the strain this was miss diamond wake falls weed review with edu and i'll see you next time", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying

"there's a little update on our diamond mining process these are the diamond dust Bubba diamonds that we capped on March 11th we haven't worked or anything since then but we definitely have diamonds show you here you can see all kinds of diamonds in there that's a nice big one right there besides that one can't see I don't hard to see because the jar but I'm not gonna open the door cuz I'm still going on with the process as you could definitely see diamonds are forming in the bottom of this solution that we had I mean are we professionals I'm making diamonds no but you know we're learning you know they probably hat is a little more to it with exact right temperature and you know the exact right consistency but we are definitely making diamonds from what we are doing so there's no denying it there it is and you know obviously the more concentrated your solution is the bigger your diamonds well the more more diamonds you'll get in that container because I mean if you don't have much THC in there you can't you're not gonna fill the drawer with diamonds for sure but we're just gonna leave this here and not a carry on I mean we're in no hurry to smoke this and we'll give you some more updates down the road but you know and the job is a big fatty right they're starting to clump up along it so as the process continues they will grow once once you have one diamond forming it's basically the seed and the rest will follow along well that suckers getting big thanks for watching guys and viewing and I hope you guys are having some success at home if you're not feel free to DM

this I'm not really getting many more bubbles so we're gonna cap it at this point and I'm betting that because the concentration is a lot more in that jar and this time I'm using a better jar to be

we're always smoking til you that's is fire whoo damn I gotta give me a kiss I remember when I first caught my stairs I sky call that shit's easy like in the first my first dizzy video that I made I called it easy I don't know why like I just like it's how the gas is when I uploaded the video my boy ha skal the heel is just like any bro you said it wrong it's dizzy not easy and that's hella gas yeah everyone was just like it's it's not Stacy its dizzy I even miss spelled it wrong I mean I fixed it already I put two eyes instead of three I've had an idea for like a good maybe like two weeks now and right now I just kind of like visualize it you know so [ __ ] let off these raw garden cartridges and I'm like you know what bro what if I were just to upload like my blogs onto here because people are asking me to make a vlogging channel but I already have three channels let me have four channels but a three that are pretty much like primary it's in the cut in the cut TV and in the cut gaming or pretty much it's just in the cut and in the end the cut gaming and the cut TV is just more like a Buddhist reaction channel you know it's just random [ __ ] you know but we're still chiefin it though you guys wanna check it out in the cut gaming we're like gaming would like to wear like subscribers you know with like the viewers the supporters bro you know in the cut BAM we're gaming with you guys and we're just like playing like like GTA pretty much so if you guys you know you guys [ __ ] with GTA videos or you're gaming in general slide through and of course this channel is a ton of educational purposes only we do not condone the usage of these products we do not condemn ourselves on these products and we do not sell anything on this chat no when we go out and I'm thinking about doing like a vlog we literally always chief a like when chief of before/after cuz I okay one time we went to Santa row so here in the bay there's a place called Santana Row it's like a cool oh you know it's nice old mall a nice restaurants you know it's like because it's kind of a nice place to take your to take like your girl you know what your dude on a date out there anyways like we went out there right and like I was just a we were just blogging pretty much like one of the mall and then went like to Santana Row we're literally like outside of the Gucci store just like smoking a joint bro out here being rebels [ __ ] Donald Trump that shows [ __ ] late and I was just thinking I was like bro why don't I just upload those vlogs like I know you guys like watching videos of like you know people chiefin and like all that [ __ ] but if it's like if I incorporate it you know it's like if I show you guys like my daily life those days or like I'm just cheeping to throughout the day you'll have to get some content and all that [ __ ] some like why don't I just blog that [ __ ] and I already have a blog where you know like I said we [ __ ] we go to the mall we gonna like the Gucci store and [ __ ] but like we're just like chief in in pretty much you know and then we go to [ __ ] we go to the yard house and then we buy like a fat-ass big-ass beard those uh I think it's called a yard long yard yard some [ __ ] like that right people are telling me to like upload vlogs but I'm just like I could definitely keep dropping videos like these and then I could drop vlogs because it like a beginning of the vlog the middle the vlogger end of the vlog there's gonna be like a little section we're just like chief and enjoying talking you guys seem like these videos you know we might review like a tree we're thinking about hitting like Miami oh and check this out I also have two vlogs full length like like 15-20 minute blogs when I went to SF we literally went to the club we went to like the the Bay Bridge we chiefed it there technically we're on an island which is pretty crazy now [ __ ] I forgot what that shit's that islands calm but it was dumb so he cheaped it there and then we went to go eat at some nice little restaurant and we cheap them more and I went to Chinatown and we're cheapening right so that's like that vlog right so that's one whole vlog that SF and then I went to [ __ ] I want to Las Vegas and I I went I was there for four days but I only blogged the first two cuz the last three and four was just like I was just [ __ ] exhausted to carrier like [ __

"fVIclho0GoY": "[Music] yeah see i understand the purple lotus was started up you know quite different than i think a lot of other dispensaries and especially dispensaries in san jose were established it was just established by my by my wife and i was in a situation where i had a lot of money that i was coming into this with a huge investment or anything and just lost you know money doing in a business venture um it was kind of my first forte into business that lost a lot of money was credit card debt but we started up the shop with a very small amount of money about fifteen thousand dollars when i opened the shop i had you know just four jars of marijuana about a little less than two pounds of marijuana i mean this this place over here really set us off i mean you would have people flocking from all over this area to to come on a daily basis it became a community of people the landlord that i was leasing from was leasing to another dispensary upstairs so we had we had competition up there and all humility you know they were closed within about three months of us being there um you know we just my motto was to reinvest that product you know i sold the original product and then i made the sacrifice didn't hire anybody i worked for a year straight just myself right there every day all day and just put all the money back in the product and that increased business and so many people were such strong advocates because they saw what we were about which was first of all people love great cannabis they love great wheat so we had great weed at the good price and then we were good people we got more involved in the community and because people came every day we became you know they became part of our lives we became part of theirs also when we first moved in here i mean i would park up here every day and then at night time i would take the bud with me inside ikea bags for the first maybe three months because i didn't really have a good safe situation so i would take it with me at the end of the night bring all the cannabis back with me the next morning i said this was popping up here as much as i like to at the time say that they weren't you know people smoking people you know a lot going on up here in the parking lot we ended up needing to get a guard up here to ensure that everything was all cool everything was all cool but they came from every which way they came by car they came by bike scooter walking because these apartments right here and all this area around here you know the bus stops right there this was a community right here people are proud to say that they came here to jackson you hear people say oh i've been coming here since jackson great great great memories from this place fought hard to stay here you know didn't work out but uh this will always be the original [Music] spot we barely squeaked into our next location over on lundy it was it was a rough move i mean it was not a successful situation at all it's very tough to get somebody to lease to us during that time it's not like now it's still very federally legal and people are really concerned we paid six months in advance and got the place over here and once again from day one we had issues um you know just especially in this place this has a shared uh it's an office building uh as a shared air conditioning unit by this time we were carrying a large supply of marijuana and uh the whole buildings just stunk like even though this is not far away people felt like it was far away so this was always a place where we were waiting for white road this is you know we had white road that we were building out while we were here so we struggled through this place they wanted to evict us from day one we fought through that and ended up staying for six months while the business i don't think grew a lot of customers during that time what we did is we grew a lot of resilience during that time we used to tell them hey uh you'll find this over by the loading dock you know you know that's i believe at one point we ran an extension cord from way over here down to the street just so that we could sit there and put a light out so that people could know that we could tell them that there's a light down there because it was so dark you would miss this because this is a building that closes at nighttime except for if you're selling wheat up here then it closes a lot later [Music] this was the nicest place we had built out beautiful place it was formally been a bar and we just made it really nice restored the bar had it all set up to serve it was really right in the middle of where at that point a good portion of our patient base was that opened up people were lined out everybody they were fighting to be the first person to say that they were the first person to come through the door um you know my mom came to pictures of all of us so happy to be opening up this great location we have been working for months to get it we didn't have a lot of money evicted from the other spot this other spot unlucky wasn't working out so you know we got this set up big day our biggest day ever still had the other location open but pushing most of the people down here feeling great eight o'clock sheriff's come tell us we need to close this it just happens to be this whole area is san jose and this corner right here out of all this area annexed to the county and the city had given us a business license for the address but it still fell underneath the county zone and the county at that time it had a ban on all cannabis activity even though san jose city allowed it this was a beautiful place we put all of our resources into and they closed this place down right here it was a big blow it hurt especially after only being open for about 10 hours [Music] you know 903 was was a blessing i didn't see it at the time but blessings come hidden and you know looking at the spot there's only about eight parking spots assigned to us but see how you can make that work especially with the employees and you know us needing parking we ended up uh leasing a little spot next door for parking um and making it work we put four or five security guards there at about a 50-yard uh uh distance and they just funnel people in and out in and out in and out it was a 4 20 weekend hey what year we moved in over there and uh it was actually it was a convention there's a big hemp con or something in town and uh we did 42 42.8 you know out the door and by that time we had built our our our venue up to 30 or 35 strains good bud 42 out the door and it you know it worked so well that we just kept it moving from there we just decided hey this works and we just kept on doing it and we kept on selling at 42.8 and it became just very popular we got to the point that it was you know we were running five six hundred people a day in through what was a 600 square foot retail sales floor with eight parking spots i'll tell you man one christmas day we're the only shop open man lined up from here all the way down to the head man waiting to get inside the facility we were the only club open on christmas we've been we never closed from the first day we opened we never closed we never been closed for one day we've been open for i think it's coming up on 4 000 days in a row no matter what happened we opened almost 4 000 days in a row [Music] listen lou gehrig type street [ __ ] you know what i mean you started talking about that you know with iron man because iron man [Music] you", "WgJN23rfcvE": "[Music] you hey what's up guys simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "7GFvSc37euo": "[Music] Hey

7-eleven but I am filming this on 7/10 we do got an extract review it is coming to you by Cali kosher this is the GMO it's coming to you at a 72 percent on the THC and nothing on the CBD this GMO is garlic cookies if you guys don't know what that is and how you get garlic cookies is you cross skin dog with Girl Scout cookies and that's how you get the garlic cookies I did get this at Manzanilla in Merced and this is a live rosin battered [ __ ] looks amazing it smells just like like garlic like the GMO weed does if you guys haven't tried that I highly suggest finding some GMO and checking it out so this is the live rosin batter some live rosin by Kaui kosher and this is the GMO oh if you guys want to see an up-close look at this before I when I first opened it before I touched it go ahead and check it out [Music] just get a better picture and get a better feel of what it looks like the texture and the consistency I got a big-ass blob there as you can see since it is 710 cheers everybody hope you guys are having a great [ __ ] day hope you guys are dabbing on something great today and let's get it in shall we damn it [ __ ] tastes amazing the flavor on this is so good I like Cali kosher it's a really clean it's really clean brand so far all the extracts I tried from them are all very clean and smooth not harsh grape flavor [Music] if you guys haven't tried to need any strains by Cali kosher I I definitely recommend checking them out oh one more in there one more let's get it all right I'm gonna take it's 2 for the review you know how I do I'm gonna take the second one out of my dizzle puffs I really like this cuz you can put a lot of water in it and hit it and it does not you don't get anything in your mouth so this is a cool ass [ __ ] rig I really like it I got it out of the daily high club daily high club box which I am no longer a part of because I cannot handle waiting the extra month for my [ __ ] product to come in but they do have a cool ass box I just don't feel like waiting an extra month to get it anymore okay cause I wear my hat to for the review you're gonna have to get the second one in on the dizzle puffs I gotta say out of stone eNOS this isn't the the like stoniest [ __ ] extract I've had but it is really [ __ ] clean and and it tastes really good it tastes good it's good I really like it it's just not one of the ones that's gonna put your dick in the dirt you know it is only 72 percent on the THC I've had extracts that are upwards of 90 you know percent on the THC so and if you guys didn't see the video or I eat the bugs go check that out those things don't look like they'd be that bad but almost puke they're not good let's go let's get this heat it up everybody who's not following my Instagram you need to do go do so because I will be doing another raffle giveaway doing a giveaway raffle whatever here in like next week so I'll be announcing at Monday so stay tuned for that there's no cars good a nice and hot now

3040 bucks extra I like I'm gonna remind me of the old eazy-e glasses I think they're dope I with my sunglasses at night but it's not night time it's only like noon it is noon people on seven 10:17 extracts all right cheers everybody let's get the last dizzle drizzle in oh man that's some [ __ ] poop I'm gonna be sweating over here huh the other day when I got this hat I had them put a smoking a small town on the side of it'll it'd go okay start factoring everything in for this review smoothness it's really good it's not harsh on your throat it's not like [ __ ] me up right now yeah made me cough is that [ __ ] got me baked but my throat's good the taste is is a really clean GMO flavor a real strong GMO flavor I I really like the flavor price I got this a Manzanilla in Merced California and the price was a little steep it's gonna run you like thirty some almost forty bucks for the gram it's kind of pricey but it's really good product hey there's rosin not resin so Highness it's not it doesn't get me like the highest I've ever been off the extract I've been way more baked but like I said I've had [ __ ] upwards of 95 percent or higher so this is only a 72 percent and it hits like a 72 percent am I disappointed no I'm tremendum by am super baked I've just been hired so factoring everything in I am impressed with it even with the overall strain because I do like the flavor I am really baked and it's really smooth it's good stuff I like GMO so I'm gonna have to give it an even 8 I really like it because I like the flavor a lot and I am high so I'm gonna have to give it to even eight for the Cali kosher GMO live rosin bag they even ate it is a very solid strain I highly recommend it all right everybody that was my review until next time smoke in a small town", "Xf1uB_qsnqg": "[Music] hey everyone jay ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast weed tour 2020 review today's product the space coyote infused sativa joint super dope product here that we have gmo root beer flour lemon bean resin total combined thc 80 no 837.5 milligrams or 33.5 thc no cbd and it says manufactured on september september 18th so super dope um they've got 93 herb 7 live resin it says it is infused with field extracts so looks like we're going to get something nice and delicious here i think i think ultimately i think ultimately this is going to be one of the best items that we're going to be reviewing number one i'm a sativa fan i have a little bit of experience trying their products so unless it's an ultimate fail which i doubt i think this is going to be something super delicious so one hit we're gonna talk about it two hits give you a score out of ten these are little infused joints oh yeah i gotta pinch it and slide they just showed me how to do this yeah there we go we took some pictures of this earlier so it's already open but it's got this nice little looks probably like a recyclable little container pouch thing here this little baby joint not too shabby let's smell it smells kind of spicy and earthy lots of flavor in the in the uh dry pool though wow definitely some good flavor all right so we're gonna give it a good light i'm gonna hit it once talk about it two hit score out of ten read the full review on respect my region dot com subscribe like follow all that good jazz on youtube please on instagram respectmyregion.us here we go first hit all right here we go does it say does it say the strain does it say the strain anywhere gmo root beer flour lemon bean resin i don't i'm getting a little bit of this lemon floral aftertaste but i'm not really getting much of this gmo i guess i'm getting mainly earthy and spiciness i'm not getting any kind of other flavors that i would like this you know those funky musks the garlics that awkward that awkward onion flavor that comes with the gmo i'm just not getting that and now we got a big rip on that one so yeah still i'm just primarily getting the the the live resin on it definitely roast the nostrils i can feel myself getting super head high right now and to be honest i love it when you're really thinking about a sativa you want this you want to mimic this effect of like caffeine but without the jitters but also this focus and you know if there's a body high that can make you feel all you know energized and you four too that's always good so you know for me a score out of 10 for this one you know in a fused joint it's not harsh definitely some good terps i wish the flower came through a little bit more but i can't say that i've smoked gmo root beer before so kind of a tough call for me there um you know i'm sitting at an 8.5 on the space coyote uh i think the flower definitely leaves me with some room to to to want more or to want a better strain but i feel like the live resin really shined through on this i love the packaging uh i love that this little thing here is branded um and all that so great work to space coyote really appreciate you guys for the love let me know what you guys think be sure to follow them on instagram and uh make sure to go support them if you see i see them at a local dispensary appreciate you guys

exciting time get ready for that stretch buddy i hope you got room howitzer just dropped a bunch of strains for that first organic run buddy you're gonna enjoy it i'm never going back personally daniel about two weeks of harvest someone retransplanted all plants some weird stuff going on with the lazar huh interesting you know actually oh ross goes into chat i love rosco i want to talk about this one right here two weeks from harvest we got a we got a message in the chat and i thought this was really interesting someone was talking about how they get frustrated in late harvest because you kind of get stuck on repeat you're going in there and you're looking for the trichomes and there's really not much to do you're not even mixing nutrients a lot of the time you're just watering with plain water you're doing a flush the plants aren't changing much as they say and they say that's their least favorite time and someone else chimed in and said yeah i heard dr coco say that i feel the same way i couldn't disagree more i love late flower it's one of my favorite times i think that everybody has their well listen all parts of growing are fun right let's be honest like but i think that people have their favorites and least favorites for totally different reasons even though we all love growing cannabis throughout the entire cycle you know what i mean so i thought that was funny maybe you guys can let me know and chat if uh if if you're down with the autopilot mode where you don't have to do anything see for me that's just i can be lazier um i like checking the trichomes i like forcing myself to not check the trichomes and just watch the plant for a couple days and then be like okay i think i think it's ready and then go check it out my least favorite times what are my least favorite times um probably early flower because i think that's the most stressful for me i'm worried about stretch they're not stinking yet so i can't enjoy oh that's the other thing i love going in and smelling the fresh flowers that's that's the main reason i like light flowers i'm in there whiffing it and stinking like plants all day so maybe i guess i would say early flower you know something else is i don't appreciate the clone stage very much um like you can only succeeding is like the par for the clone stage you can only let yourself down so let's see what chat says doc says autopilot uh can't wait i agree love getting down at the micro level changes happening daily that's why i'm liking the autoflowers we're gonna talk about the autoflowers in a second uh gotta say how helpful this whole group has been for a first time or okay that's great man i love that um david hates waiting yeah totally dude a lot of people would agree the great dr coco agrees it's just funny how everybody has like a different a different perspective on that close to harvest is boring as hell uh i love the last couple of weeks great pictures oh that's a good point too man if you're not a photographer the last few weeks are much i'm you're probably excited for harvest but if you're a photographer getting those bud shots that's a really good point i love all of flower stage auto is an early flower there's the good answer can i show you guys my auto hold on i got to finish this review um it smokes [ __ ] crazy it smokes crazy good it's like um the high is almost lucid but powerful like the key lime pie when i was talking to steve resiner i was kind of zoning out on that key lime pot like the key lime pie is much more uh like almost inebriating this is like a lucid but powerful kind of head buzz so the uh the buzz on the slurrican is great and then let me get a little flavor profile and then we'll pick up the autos welcome to addcast so we'll just start a death star that's one of my favorite strange dark star death star underrated some good humble experiences with those the gas comes through more than the sweetness i think that's one of the people one of the reasons people really like the the gas turps the diesel terps is they don't get lost in the flavor i find that the fruity flavors are much harder to translate once you've lit the i'm sure that has to do with the boiling points i absolutely know this to be correct just from experience right because fruity strains smell so fruity and even when you puff the joint before it's lit i just spit on the camera sorry about that even when you buff the joint before it's lit and you're breathing in you can taste that heavy heavy fruit when you light it it does come through a lot of the time especially those really good fruity strains but i think it comes through less than the skunks and the gases tend to really hit that flavor profile coffee terps also come through with that flavor profile i don't know if you guys would agree with that or not i know we gotta do something about the tp world this is the last time this is the last time all right we're getting the smoke uh smoke trap back the tp roll is is unacceptable the poop tube as i call it uh it's absolutely unacceptable okay let's go to the uh auto tent where we going here six yes there we are there's the golf clap let's upgrade it now i had a potassium deficiency have a potassium deficiency um but you can see that it's filling out really really nicely it says that it's just like 10 days from harvest which i i must have input the wrong date because it's so white-haired still um but what can i say it's happy and i got an oscillator in there it's probably a little bit too powerful and put on manual focus here you can see the deficiency in the tips there but yeah look at how white the hairs are still um but then you can't see it from here but the nug meat is extraordinarily purple there you go you can see the purple you can see the purple kind of black background there very very happy about the anvil now let me be honest the trichome coverage is not what i expected yet again it's got a while ago please ignore the sad tomatoes as well uh it's got a while ago but the trichome coverage i hope it frosts up a little bit more the smell is actually on point it's really like herbaceous and piney and uh the smell is on point so far i'm happy with the smell so i'm actually all i've heard about anvil is how it's so potent so i was expecting a little more trichome coverage and again it's got a while to go so i hope it packs on packs on some uh some goodness there what do you guys think nice looks happy a little small yeah i could have filled it more um but i just kind of let it grow wild i didn't fill the pot very much because i was concerned about it getting too big someone still never tried autos my mandalorian cut just started getting some perp it's in a 10 gallon pot but it's only filled about halfway um it's hard to make an auto big i've seen some pretty big autos buddy especially the the yeah it's a oh no mando cut oh from someone else oh yeah man oh yeah corn coast auto growers you got to get in the auto chat and post some uh post some pics because yeah autos yield incredibly well especially on a large scale too many crazy photos trains always get sucked into buying dude that's how i feel all the time that's why i actually wanted to try these uh auto strains that aren't really available as photos like i had to try anvil so i had to grow autos you know the purple micro dot gets huge joey wants to try auto so you know someone who's really picky about um potency i guess you could say just just like that that photo period [ __ ] fireness like rich is one of those people he won't touch autos and that's why every one of his pictures is like absurd um but we all have different goals and i'm i want to grow different plants that's one of my main things is like grow different plants not even cannabis a lot of the time so of course i'm going to try autos gotta try autos oh wait one second can we go back to the auto tent really quick can we go back there oh we weren't able to get the [ __ ] can you see past those green onions what do you see there we got the pina colada everybody that's the pina colada behind the green onions let me make sure it focuses there you go bring him into focus it's a little stretched i gotta raise it up um it's it's actually not that stretched yet but if i just keep that cmh up high it's going to be stretched so i actually think i'm gonna like stick a little led down there or something for some supplemental maybe but uh it's healthy it's happy it's growing that is my favorite sound effect ever all right great good to know the pina looks great guys i know it's a um white label mosca autoflower you know someone hopped in and i appreciate the person who by the way told me that um and he told me that it was white label so i just kind of the guy reminded me in the chat you know this isn't bred by mosca um so that is important to know but as long as it's fire i'm happy and it has that vigor it has that bigger dj pina in the house i really gotta harvest those onions they've been ready for harvest for a long time do we have any guests in the chat i don't want to ignore if anybody hopped in you know i was expecting a couple of guests i don't think so what up black slow sneakers jesse everybody who i didn't see here toby corn twist shifty sasha um mad farmer is going to jump in one of these times heart and soil is going to jump in one of these times coco said he's going to jump in next week this friday's episode with dr coco is really good it's super entertaining and informative we talk about reflectivity and tent walls we talk about uh like how that plays into basically the yield photon distribution in the yield and what happens when you take away walls or paintballs black it's really really cool and then also he gets into some personal stuff like the strains that personally he doesn't like that are very very popular i kind of bring up that thing i always talk about like the ones that everybody loves but for some reason you don't anyways it's a good episode and it drops friday so look forward to that super super good episode really proud of that one jake's in the chat what up what up jay let me finish this off and uh what do you think i'll check on the photo tent we'll smoke one more i got some stuff on the menu here oh you guys got to help me pick my next seeds i need help picking my next photo seeds i have the dino light here we could check out rich's buds up close that's option number two um or we could also and or i got some pickled okra from bosum shout out to bosum it's already half gone because it's so [ __ ] delicious uh and so i could eat this i'm going to eat this this is happening so what do you guys think where are we headed what do you think should we do a little dino light action do a little dynalite action pick some seeds for the next run let's do dino light let's do some dino light what's an impressive looking one here we'll show off more buds this is going to turn into a bit of a strain review episode i like that why not you never know what you're gonna get on gc tv i want it to be impromptu i want it to be live i want it to be interactive so let's jump down here and take a look at the 10th planet number one wowie zowie they just say wowie zowie now this is probably the most impressive single bud butlet in the whole sample pack i really need hold on one second guys hold on one second i'll be right back and turn another light there we are everybody we're back and take a look at the tenth planet have you ever seen anything so sexy it's got some nice purple on it i feel like the other shot was brighter i don't know if that was cambot who did that or what oh you can tell it's fire though so what kind of terps do we got on this 10th planet now this is a little fresh i can tell instantly that this needs to be cured i can just tell right away and i've smoked his 10th planet before and this hasn't come out all the way so i'm just going to call it like i sees it and then from the outside it smells a little uncured which i'm fine with i love it bust it open bitter like plant bitters kush bitter bitter kush like plant bitters like the wild grass that you break in half and you touch it and your tongue goes tongue goes numb it smells like plant bitters and just that cushy i look at my dirty nails i should have cut my nails before the stream that kind of cushy pungent aroma i guess you could say let's fire it up let's fire it up okay super sticky someone said sticky yes this is by ethos how did i not say ethos ethos genetics um super sticky man crazy what strain are you putting out that crosses of the 10th planet so there is an episode on seeds coming up this saturday that we me and rich finally get to sit down and explain the whole thing in one episode um the 10th planet cross that we're releasing to transitioning grow past members is the lunar lemon that's a super lemon haze male so so technically i believe it would be 10th planet crossed with super lemon haze f5 so that's lemon haze 10th planet that's the lunar lemon super excited for that one and then i believe that rich held on and hit the peach pie to the 10th planet as well and that's gonna be the second pollination please don't misquote me on that but i'm pretty sure he's taking the peach pie mail and he's hitting the tenth planet um please release to everyone not just transitioning members we're giving away all of our seeds that we have so we're doing our best we're getting we're getting more traction than we thought and trust me uh you are going to love the second pollination too i'm telling you man we're literally giving away all of our seats so it's not like we're holding on to anything we're just taking care of the transitioning members first because they've they came with us from grow pass and they've been members for a long time so honestly rich is more excited about the second and third pollinations someone says hayes [ __ ] yeah um gonna be a great year yeah the peach pie mail is very very impressive not to say that the super lemon haze one isn't but the peach pie mail is is insane uh so transition member is getting lunar lemon transition you gotta listen to the episode saturday we'll break it all down transitioning members are getting from the first pollination so that's that super lemon haze f5 male it is random what you're going to be receiving some are going to be more rare some are going to be less rare you're either going to receive a lunar lemon 10th planet crossed with super lemon haze or a citrus bliss which is a key lime skittles bike purple caper crossed with super lemon haze f5 and those are the two more common packs that people are going to be getting and there's a couple small ones because you gotta understand this was a very small pollination and we really didn't know that there was going to be such a rush and then the really rare ones are the f berry lemon that's f berries that's rich's strain and the lemon haze and then the coffee f5 in lemon haze those are the two super super rare ones but guys i'm telling you like rich is stoked on those but the second pollination is where it's going to be insane rich is working some crazy [ __ ] he's working with this hurricane cut right now he wants to do this yeah selective tent breeding exactly he's got multiple tents he was doing he was doing it by hand now he's doing multiple tents with open pollination um and you can contact rizzo rich so please don't don't misquote me but he explains in this episode as well so yeah he's got multiple tents and i'm telling you the peach pie male with the f berry is going to be insane the peach pie male with the slurrican i think he's putting together he wants to do like some sort of purple punch hurricane back cross so don't feel like you're missing out because you're not getting the lunar lemon i'm sure it's gonna be a great strain and i'm sure we can all trade seeds too like you know self it out do what you will with these strains they're auto seeds they're auto seeds they're regular seeds oh my god everybody just freaked out they're regular seeds so you can do what you want with them um and trust me don't feel like you missed out we're going as fast as we can peach pie ex coffee would be dopey right we're going as fast as we can and uh and you are going to get some [ __ ] fire genetics i think we're just going to give okay so obviously some members are going to get members only strains like they're going to be some strains that are only members only if you're going to be part of the community then you should get some select trains we'll probably end up doing some like first dibs type scenarios and i think we're probably probably going to give just like five dollars off for every pack you buy we want to we want to incentivize it and take care of the members so if you buy two packs you do your you've saved your fee sort of thing so we're gonna take care of it not just with member only strains we'll we'll make it nice we'll give you a little discount we'll do giveaways like crazy trust me there's gonna be a lot of seeds being given away but we gotta stockpile these [ __ ] um because you guys came out in force okay i'm glad i didn't over promise because you guys came out in force there's lots of people signing up man i'm really really happy about it so i can't thank you enough i'm supposed to be packing um this hurricane crept up on me 100 it crept up on me i'm breeding i can make some copies so here's the thing like i said rich is a very selective type person but i would love to actually get really interactive with the breeding and maybe start doing some breeding of my own especially when i get into my next place after after this place is up i'm gonna get into a bigger space and i would love to like get really interactive with you guys like if you have pollen we could do mini batches together you know i mean let rich have the fire [ __ ] and then i can really do like an interactive community type breeding thing maybe that's way down the road that was just something i was thinking that would be really cool to involve you guys so that's the idea that's the plan prediction i would love lots of extra seeds kicking my around my house yeah people saying they'd love to cool that sounds it's a no-brainer doc callux is doing breeding we're going to do a release with him i'm sure eventually um it'll be fun but we got to take our time you know i really like to focus on one thing at a time get it right don't leave anybody hanging speaking of which with those seeds i'm also sending out all the founding member shirts i have all you founding members we want to wait till the end of january in case some founding member is busy or who knows and then it gets in at the end of the month but i'm going to start shipping those out anyways appreciate you new members you old members your founding members love all of you what are we doing we're smoking 10th planet we're smoking 10th planet what was the plan though wasn't there like a oh the dino light duh good lord the dino light you guys high how's the grow cast rolling trays coming uh working with someone in slack currently i think it's um canada grower or ceo grows is going to do some small scale printing the founding members we decided to go with the shirt we were going to do rolling trays we decided to go with the shirt just because we already have it all lined up i didn't want to goof anything up why isn't this working it should slide right in i got a very special cooling tray there it is is this gonna work so high oh crap oh crap dude who says that ryan i'm gonna give you a price that's the comment we should do comments of the of the stream i'll send you some coffee this is some good old-fashioned mukbang [ __ ] is bosom even in chat oh he's gonna be so pissed he'll catch the replay buddy you make some mean okra i'm gonna i'm gonna reach in with my dirty nails full of soil and i'm going to pull it out and i'm going to eat it right into the microphone it's so good it's so damn good probiotic as [ __ ] profile this guy's cracking me up vinegar just a little bit sweet and a little bit spicy are you supposed to eat the butts i eat the butts they cut these really short too hmm lord that is some of the best okra i've ever had in my life not too sweet not too spicy then there were only like eight or ten because they use all this other stuff they'd have to eat that jordan area that's in there thank you bosa good lord i love the honest commentary like the caption you left on the gp post apologizing for the grunting listen guys i'm i'm a goofy guy i like to be goofball sometimes and i think that we've cultivated a crazy unique community here grow cast listeners are unique it is like is people who truly want to just grow better weed and help people grow better read everybody always preaches about positivity online and then you notice them attacking somebody in the very next post and it's like this community is truly that's why i put in the slack chat rules our number one goal is to help growers succeed and to share our successes and the more laser focused you can remain on that goal and the less distracted you can get with outside noise then i i'm all for that i mean unless your goals differ then please laser focus on that but for me i want to help as many people as i can i want to educate you guys and i want to celebrate successes together like what we're about to dive into here here here quote of the show i eat the butts correct sir here here all right everybody let's try it let's dive into trichome world [ __ ] a somebody says i know a thing or two about oh geez should i have taken the dino light out oh no because it would take away from the camera obviously oh my god you guys under the dyno light this is a whole nother level look at that it is pure purple it's like uh just completely saturated with anthocyanins i barely see any green you know something rich's weed looks less purple than it is because it's so covered in trichomes you don't see it's so white on the outside geez look at that not very much amber um you know what this looks like to me these trichome heads look withered it looks like i didn't store this very well oh look at that it looks like this this has been in my dry basement and uh in these plastic caps i need to store these testers better you can see those unbroken trichome heads like right there look at that oh look at that see i mean the outside layer is also going to be the one that suffers from the from the poor storage that's a good mix right there you see one kind of clear but dark almost trichome in the back left you got some cloudies and then a lot of amber you can see that the look at the size of the trichome head on the hair are you [ __ ] me what see you got to just get up in it and if you guys haven't seen the the last member trichome exploration where i went down in the grand caper i highly suggest you go back and watch those and i highly highly suggest you get one of these and just take a look at the differences in the trichomes these heads don't look particularly large they look well those kind of do they look like a medium sized trichome head and my understanding is that can affect the type of uh the type of concentrate that it's suited for if you're doing like a frenchy type hashi she's looking for like a certain size whoa look at that thing you guys what the [ __ ] are you guys seeing this have you ever seen a trichome like that before anybody that's crazy look how long those stems are what are the trichome stems called doc alex you in the chat that was the longest trichome stem i've ever seen and the largest trichome head i've seen on coming off of a hair you know what i'm really searching out for is a purple trichome head which i'm not seeing a lot of that's one thing i saw on the grand caper that really got my rocks off oh there's a little bit of blue there's a little that's not a glare no matter how i shift it there's something in that tricom head there wow wow wow wow so this is the 10th planet by ethos we all know it's good i'm grateful to have this bud i'm gonna smoke this tonight i've been saving this for you members oh yeah that's the purple i'm looking for that's just bud porn calyx yeah what's the what's the stem of the trichome saw the stock called is there a name for that we saw one that was insanely long i've never seen anything like it it was it was five times longer than it should have been there's like a long hair purple hair this is the craziest [ __ ] weed i've ever seen this is you guys go back and look at the grand caper and look at how it differed from this milky trichomes i think a lot of these like i said this might have to do with the storage conditions all right one more shot and this is an underskirt into the into the nug that's been broken open so this should be more intact heads here yep this is the inside of the nug and this is really where i see like pgr there's another long trichome stem but not quite as long it was much longer than that this is where i see like pgr dispensary weed really fall short when you crack it open and you look at the outside compared to the inside the homegrown non-chemical pgr weed uh the inside is much more trichome covered the inside of the the commercial bud is just weird that is dense have you seen a patch that dense before my friend wow wow that's a good place and some silver going on there i really differentiate the difference between clear and silver go watch again go watch the uh there's some right next to each other go watch the grand caper video and you'll see some like clear next to some some sort of silver almost cobalt blue wow okay that's enough for now dragon ball i see a dragon ball all right let's bring it back out into the real world we're back everybody what do you think another feature of grow cass tv 10th planet you guys hitting up ethos tonight or what we've talked about it before dense yeah for organic it really is man you know i've been trying to get ethos calling on forever ethos colin plays high stakes poker see you is he a good guy and everything i mean i don't know anything else about him but when i heard that i was like let's do it i don't know you can dm me your thoughts uh let's see what do we got my two-year-old homegrown is still trichome-rich in the nug but this looks amazing nice man yeah the storage conditions for sure right is that my head oh sorry about that let's grab in this uh this box here yeah the storage conditions really do really do matter that's something that i should do better on you know what's interesting doc was doc dr coco was saying how the smaller bud jars are an optimal size and he had a whole reason for it i thought that was interesting all right we got a couple more minutes here let's keep it running i want to go through some seed packs here since we're on genetics you guys can let me know what you want to see me grow so i have some blood king from urban soulja this is blood king and kingpin there's only going to be a few options here of course i'm growing the ice cream wolfman so this is probably going to be two of my three photos one or two of my three photo period plants and then uh so the choices are the blood king the island hopper f gui and kona gold that's by grassmann genetics now defunct grassman genetics supposedly and then the final option which i think you guys are going to pick is funkadelic this is cereal milk crossed with 706 skunk and uh i like i love skunk i talk about it in this cocoa episode funnily enough in a very hilarious way um and i and the cereal milk really excites me the terp drip is getting so frosty you guys and the terp drip is royal goo across with cereal milk so those are my three those are my three options here brett's in the chat what's up buddy i didn't see you hop in there everybody brett brett from uh heart and soil welcome welcome guest in the chat i am you literally popped in at the opportune time because i should only grow out one of these ice cream wolfman females so that i have room for a peruvian punch cross that you're sending me i'm super super excited for that buddy did you want to hop in do you want to chill and chat and just type with people do you want to come on voice video just let me know chat voice video we'd love to have you you know rap or not you can just sit back and chill whatever you would uh whatever you'd like let me know in chat if you'd like chat voice or video hang out grow cast tv no no a bret video uh doc i would love to have you on video buddy it's no doc knf along coming up i'm talking to uh the great brett we're bringing him on video how do we do this how do we do this doc is high but doc is always welcome on the show he knows that hello brett can you hear me let's see he's muted so i think you have to unmute from your end and we should be able to hear you boom what up buddy how are you doing you can't now i can't hear you testing one two can you guys hear brett i can hear brett okay chat brett is live oh someone's saying funkadelic evening brett he's good we're all good can you hear us i can't can you hear me yes now you are good to go how's it going my friend oh good just uh just uh picking some some bad seeds out got a bunch of new genetics that we just got done shucking and you know just a little afghani hindu kush heirloom uh project that we have going so that's what i've been doing all day did you just hold hold that up again i had you unpinned i want to see that yeah man i'm super excited about uh again this is this is brett from heart and soil you recently heard the breeder feature he went to mozambique there it is the afghanistan he went to mozambique went to uh mint gelato let's see uh mandarin skittles came out fat all those are crossed with afghani yeah red-headed stranger oh man uh pink pez um alien apple tropsanto green crack oh no god man just a little bit a little bit of everything thrown in there a little old school old school for the you know for the heads dude you were making my day and my members day that's amazing i'm really when can we look forward to these actually being uh you know like uh yeah for the uh instagram followers or anybody uh listening today they're available right now there you go everybody damn you've been working your ass off man yeah i crushed it today yeah i'm working with my artist um now to get some artwork done for the for the larger quantities but uh but yeah they're available right now nice man nice i would love to get my hands on some of those so tell me about the you know what you got whatever you want so you're amazing man tell me about i would love to talk about the differences in the actual land race because here's one of the reasons i really like you man because we love growers of all kinds here salt growers organic growers land rice growers hybrid growers you kind of straddle land racing hybrid you take these land races where you don't just come and release them and say hey check out this new unique land race which is awesome you hybridize them just enough to get that fire fire type of result but i want to know about the actual heirloom strains and how they differ from mozambique to peru to afghanistan you know uh so the reason you know i've been growing a long time but the reason i started uh this breeding project was i went to peru and i found this really interesting sativa um that you know from peru that just wasn't like normal sativas um so you know a lot of land races you know are wild you know they're lanky they're airy they're you know lower thc you know a lot of fiber going on there um just depends on what on what pheno you find but you know a lot of the african stuff um thai stuff but you know i'm trying to find uh you know in those in those genetic gene pools you know there's there's some thicker varieties you know some shorter varieties and even with the lenkier stuff you know just trying to find something that packs uh packs the punch and or uh you know yields a little better than traditional land races so i'm trying to like work through those land races and find the best of the best um because you know land race can be finicky you know um it's difficult to breed sometimes you know when you're selecting a male you're kind of taking a a big gamble because you know it's an untested male um you know and you're doing a lot of uh selection just based off of feeling and you know a couple different attributes um you know for the first round so um that's kind of the challenge with with land races you know no one's no one i know has grown a lot of the stuff that i'm that i'm growing and and finding males and females and doing the hybridization with but you know that's that's the fun about land races is you know you kind of find something that that you like um but that's kind of that's kind of the idea of these lines you know i do i try to do um you know a pure cross you know in this case an afghani to afghani and then find you know phenos and strains that will complement that afghani and try to bring things out that i i really like you know um you know a lot of land races are you know really resistant to pests and pathogens because they gotta you know withstand all the elements and stuff like that so they're a little tougher where some of these you know hype varieties are a little bit more coddled and you know less vigorous and things like that so i'm trying to you know combine the two so hopefully find the best of both worlds we can find some of this hurricane mac you know fire but also put it on a structure or plant that is you know resistant to pm and you know grows twice as fast as you know the normal mac you know that's kind of the idea there so you know with the blue dream for example i've found that it's really resistant to pm so that's kind of the project that i'm working on with this is you know the uh the land race you know afghani across the blue dream try to find a a crazy uh you know um pheno that's also resistant to pm that's kind of the the idea behind these you know these crosses trying to unlock some of those you know uh maybe broken gene you know gene bar you know gina somewhere down the line so yeah absolutely man that makes perfect sense and combining those two like you said i i imagine that you're looking for the dominant genes that are desirable but if you have some resistant land race train and you put it to blue dream i imagine you never have to worry about powdery mildew again some strains are just basically immune to powdery mildew right yeah and that and then blue dream has been you know in my years of cultivation you know bubba kush is one of the worst oh really yeah it uh for me i like bubba here in colorado it was one of the toughest to grow because it just got pm like a i mean just attracted like a magnet whereas the blue dream would be in the same exact room and you wouldn't see a spot on there that's so i found the old school blue dream that i had back back in the day and um and we'll see we'll see what happens but that's they also look like some of the best seeds i've seen in a long time too nice you can see i'm very very close it's probably pretty hard but they're nice and dark you know big fat seeds that's a nice if you want a nice haul a nice load of seeds you have there pardon the pun doc alex asking in chat do you find it takes a couple out crosses to reach a more modern bud structure with the typical land straits uh land race you know um a lot of the f1s that we did from the peruvian line the original line yeah some of them were a little bit you know um more airy and stuff like that but we found the nancy cut in that peruvian punch f1 line um and that's one of the strongest i mean it looks i mean i don't know if you have if you have a pick i mean you probably don't but um it's you know it's purple it's dense it's cookie it's uh so it's mendo breath crossed a purple bunch across the peruvian heirloom and that you know in the f1 we found a winner that's sitting in uh um in youth flora and they're it's crushing it for them you know same thing with the lares trek alien rock candy um 2.0 basically s1 across to the heirloom and and that one too it's just it's banging out for them f1s you know um f1s from land race hybrids you know in dispensaries you know finishing in you know eight and a half to nine and a half weeks so i ideally you'd want to do you know some some you know some more breeding down the line but um we found some you know some some down-to-earth winners in that in that f-1 um lineage so it all depends really it really all depends yeah so um there's you know there's a wide variety in f1s but there's even more variety and and variants in f2s um i've found um so the f2 you know what sometimes the f1s are even more uh they're more more um similar um to each other than the f2s um so i've taken a few things to f2 um like the peruvian punch being one of them and um and obviously the genetics a little bit thicker you know a little bit uh you know more structure in the in the f2s i'm finding but there's still there's still winners to be found in those f1 genetics so um don't count them out you know hell yeah man all about it uh what's his ig heart and soil project you'll find him on instagram lex lowe with the question do you think tech like crispr could play a major role in cannabis breeding um crispr uh please i'm not familiar with that the answer is yes it's that gen it's a gene editing program but it's something you can actually do at all there's a really there's a really great documentary on it my wife just watched it god i cannot think of the name right now it's killing me but it's good because it shows it's really it's really um even-handed it shows that like some people are trying some things that are really really dangerous and actually hurting each other other people are doing miraculous things and it's kind of all over the place and for sure we're going to be able to edit cannabis like that um i wonder how much of a market there's going to be for that cannabis because i feel that growers are particularly sensitive to that but i don't know right yeah i don't know i think you know you can you can do a lot with you know what gene editing and gmo type stuff but um there's just there's a spark in nature that that we can't ever replicate you know so i i'll always be um i'll always be breeding trend trying to breathe the natural way as much as i can and uh and trying to find that new that that this new unlocked um genetics yeah and honestly i think it's here to stay i think it's going to be another dividing issue and i think it's just going to be part of the grow world and i hope that it doesn't divide us too much it is yeah it's just a matter of opinion and now you got you got you know feminized seeds you got you know you know regular seeds you got and you'll have gene edited seeds you know and yeah and everyone's gonna you know have their opinions and we already have that you know we have the led versus hid we have the organic versus synthetic i just and that's where we always say on this show i just want to teach everyone how to grow better weed and get it out there just like you as long as you're growing something you know i don't care how you're doing it as long as you're you know uh you know playing playing a part and following uh you know your you know your uh your path your desire your passion the path yeah so it's like hey on synthetic at least i'm an organic guy but i've grown synthetic a lot and as long as you're growing you know um we're on the same team you know i love that love that man listen uh this is kind of also what i want to get back to what i said earlier someone's asking what's the key trait of the original peruvian heirloom you smoked in peru that made you want to breed with it and i would like to ask you about the mozambique as well that same question yeah so the peruvian um i found that it had a lot of the same sativa effects you know when smoking it um and a really bright um really bright flavor it reminded me of like a pink peppercorn flavor it was like a spicy but sweet kind of almost almost floral yep spice you know like a sweet pink peppercorn sweet spice you know i like that and it had that you know same sativa uplifting effect without the without the paranoia but the buds were so dense um and it was just an interesting uh thing because all the other you know flower that we had gotten in peru was um just really airy and it was still good but um this was just a unique bag and i just and i found you know i found some seeds in there brought them back and uh and tried to find a fino uh male and two you know females that were especially in the male side that were just a little bit shorter um a little bit more broad leaf uh than the typical sativa um so that's what i really liked about it and just had a um it just had an interesting look to the plant too i mean but the effect um and the the fact that the bug was still you know looked like chunky bud and not just some sativa you know dust um i was like oh this is this is interesting so that was the thing that piqued my interest first and foremost um but then also you know peru is just the history of peru and the history of uh agriculture in peru is really fascinating to me that they have the most uh varieties of corn you know the most varieties of potatoes you know some of the you know the best breeding projects and you know in uh in the world in terms of uh you know agriculture and food comes from stems from peru so what's the diff you know definition or what's the difference you know in cannabis you know i'm sure there's all kinds of uh different meeting paths you know that came from all over the world in peru um so there's a lot of different variants and just a lot of cool history that i found and that's why i started my projects with the peruvian project um and you know then once i got back and found the you know the pop the seeds and i started you know working through the plants just the plants were super interesting and and i'm i'm gonna do an f2 variety of the uh peruvian bunch down the lines i like it so much um the mozambique line um i had a good friend of mine good girl friend of mine uh out here in denver that had family out in africa and i just talked to him and i said um you know i'm always looking for you know good quality land race um verifiable genetics and his family you know i've been collecting some stuff from mozambique and from malawi um and he was gracious enough enough to uh to gift those to me so i could do the project and um you know the more i grew those um you know they're a little bit they're more on the sativa side for sure um but what i really found interesting in there in those was just their resistance and their resilience um you know they're a little a little more lanky but the heat tolerance uh the drought tolerance uh the resistance to you know um to bugs you know um was really was really strong that makes sense i mean i don't think africa is particularly a hospitable climate for a lot of different plants i mean certainly for some you know coffee and certain things do well there but that would make sense and it's interesting because it's always like it's also almost like um it's cool when it's almost like the locals have pre-selected it for you like you had someone there the reason they probably had that accessibility is because it was he probably liked it that's probably why he gave it he doesn't want to give you some [ __ ] he probably was like this is what's special for the region we're really big yeah the guards the spice trader that actually made the malawi across the mozambique um uh it had the fattest seeds that i've i've seen in a long time yeah so i'm not the size of the seed has everything to do with it but the larger the seed generally the larger the fruit and uh you know i'm all about large fruits yeah it's dope dude i love it yeah um i wanted to say yeah i remember what i wanted to touch on you were talking about peru i agree the south american when i was in colombia it's a farming people like it's reflected in the culture it's even reflected in the laws in colombia you're allowed to grow your own cannabis and consume your own cannabis but you're not allowed to sell it at all so it's like it's interesting when agriculture out inside or outside of cannabis becomes part of the culture because you know you're going to find some really special cultivars there whether you're after coffee or a fruit tree or some [ __ ] fire buds you know yeah they're trying to find you know things that work for them and they can support their family with over and over and they're going to be dependent you know so that's you know that's why i like to go to the locals they've been growing things you know over and over and over again so give me your favorite you know and i'll try to um you know spice spice up the the gene full with those uh yeah you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of requests after this so they say that your account is private so you're gonna have to let everybody in because everybody's like a sick convo somebody says as soon as i get off i like breath i'll make sure to let everybody in you know we just ooh we are we partaking oh constantly i smoke pot okay heavy smoker what do you got oh geez see this is really cool guys i i've always wanted grow cass to be like pro oriented and like not too much smoking and stuff but this is perfect what growcast tv is for this is exactly what i wanted brett just bought it i just really did i just really needed this too i was like oh we're smoking i haven't smoked a couple hours because i've been oh perfect light it up man this is this is the new spot this is the perfect place for people to to to light up and talk more about smoking and strain reviews the perfect place for people to just pop in we're going to be live at the same time every wednesday for the rest of eternity you've seen the ads so um yeah that goes for youtube right yeah so i really appreciate the invite and uh i almost forgot i was like sitting there i was literally sitting there picking seeds are you picking bad seeds and i'm like i forgot something what did i forget i was like i thought i thought it was this was thursday but uh it was thursday but i look at my like damn it it's today and i was like so glad to catch you you know what i should really start doing this is hold me to this chat i got to think out loud now because i'm you know self producing here i should start releasing the clips on wednesdays only i need to ingrain in everybody's heads not just the listeners and the members are awesome i send them they show up they're dope but even guests like everybody needs to know grow casts grow cast tv is wednesday nights i'm hitting my thc limit for my threshold of being able to host a show coherently um and i think the audience likes that they like to see me exceed that so all right let's do it i should have got a dab ready everyone's dabbing damn i did my best that was a monster dab double dab chat's getting it dabbers up says chat whoo shaka brah awesome man yes yes we got some we got some oleo rosin from denver what we smoking on i think that's some uh orange sherbet oh yeah oh yeah love it hey we're uh we usually end at the top of the hour here but but it's i do want to get a full answer from you here what's next like you just took down this huge this huge thing of all these afghans do you have anything on the line are you gonna focus on distributing what's next um so you know this new line just is about to drop we're gonna be working on the artwork um for this new line you know all of our stuff is made once never made again in its original form so we like to you know pay it a little homage and and do some fun artwork you know um it's just you know i do it partially for you guys but really i do it for me you know because who who doesn't want to name a strain and who doesn't want to you know come up with some fun artwork for it so we're we're doing that next you know that's gonna be the next project brett you're one of the few people who understands almost nobody's doing original art this is our wolf ice cream wolf man i love your original art for your every one of your strains has its own picture and yeah the peruvian line it's the worst for me we're getting started so we didn't we didn't really do that um but for the mozambique line we have uh you know an image for every strain the peruvian punch f2 we have an image for every strain the second wave we do and we're going to try to keep that going um with the skeleton hand holding up the ruby diamond that's dope as [ __ ] man i really think that that's a huge hole in most breeders game is that they don't do either original art or like coherent art so i always look forward to your posts and i always look at the name and i look at the art and it's enjoyable it's it's tough because you know obviously the you know breeding comes first right you know that the plants have to you know come first and the genetics have to be quality you know um but you know if you got that why not come up with a cool name and come up with some cool art and have a little fun with it you know because it's not going to be around forever you know and uh we're not going to be around forever like let's have some fun let's do this let's do this thing you know i feel like i just knocked you off track though weren't you talking about the next strains and i like instantly change the subject to art yeah but um yeah i think the next the next line we'll probably do you know we have we have a lot of seed stock to work with um we're probably gonna do some f2s um i'm thinking um the mac um we did uh the machu mac which is uh mac cross ii um proving punch that's the one that it was that i really wish i got my hands on when he sent me the list i saw it was crossed out it was sold out in 24 hours yeah it was quick yeah it went real quick so i mean who doesn't like mac so i'm very happy i'm appreciative but that is the one where i might just hurt my heart a lot of people didn't it was hard you know it was hard um to tell people to tell people no you can't have that because it's gone it is tough um but uh so we have some siberian land race um that we that we were working with some siberian uh super autos um so those are kind of interesting we might do some something with those um how would you define a super auto what's that how would you define a super auto so apparently you know i just got schooled up by the uh by the by the russians um they told me that the super auto is is just it's an auto but it grows a lot faster and it ends up being a bit much larger plant than most autos you know so a lot of others you know will finish it like some of them like a foot or two tall you know uh three feet tall max you know for some of them but apparently this one can get up to like five feet tall six feet tall um so it stretches a little more it's a little bit uh more lanky and then also i guess that's the super portion of it uh it's just it's a constantly you know less less lag time you know and more more plant matter so it's a that's a finicky one but that's a real adventure to take you know um this you know auto from from siberia you know it's uh kind of and they're really tiny seeds that may or may not fit our our mold we're gonna do some testing with them uh we want we always want to produce you know quality seeds and quality plants and if we can't guarantee that we're not gonna we're not gonna keep going with a project so that you know that's the idea of the peruvian or the heart and soul project it's like the project never stops you know sometimes um we we never really know where we're going next have you thrown out some things before that's really so to answer your question i have no effing idea we're going to grow these seeds out we're going to do some phenol hunting we got a bunch of different things in the garden from the peruvian punch f2 line or f2 line we're going to probably do some f2s from those so like you know the machu macarin f2 uh the can of banana uh we're gonna f2 i want both of those man i'm [ __ ] ones you know i mean so here's like you know like the artwork you're talking about so these are the stickers yeah you know uh ghost punchers sucker pucker punch just hit me up first when those drop i do not i i don't expect or want charity you've been kind enough already you sent me three packs for free thank you everyone go give him a follow he's he's officially a friend of girl cast i'm gonna give away some of those packs i can't i can't grow all three of them i'm sure so i'm sure i'll give away members let's do something there too um you know the mozambique line i have a ton of stock of um i would love to to donate some and for some giveaways that would be incredible look at that chat look at that what a nice guy so anyways let me know on that mac i'll purchase some from you i need to buy the mac i need to buy the can of banana this is a this has got to be a grocery the next two projects coming up um and we might do one more round with our peruvian uh punch male it's he's so studly he's just so studly normally we like let males go we'll breed with them and then we move on but this one is just so impressive we've kept them around and there's a lot of interesting ladies in the tent um in the 10 by 10 uh room uh with it and um so we're gonna let the plants decide on on who on who gets to go go oh yeah chat's blowing up by the way everybody's saying thank you nice someone just screamed ah another person said hell yeah someone said [ __ ] yeah one person's just literally exclaiming exclaiming exclamation point happy man that's dope we'll link up i appreciate you brett uh we're past the hour which means it was yeah i don't wanna i don't wanna take up for your time and i gotta get to the get to the family i'm sure my wife's wondering where the hell i went that's why i actually have a

brilliant really nice guy i like that guy a lot smaller breeder on instagram and if you want to do the land races maybe you want to jump all the way in or maybe you do he's got some of those too i like that i like that guy's style let's light it up one more time and then we'll sign off here folks i appreciate you what do we got coming up that's how i should really end these i'm trying to get a flow for these you know maybe like smoke up in the beginning featured riff and then like the guest if there's no guest a video i don't know we're getting a flow and then at the end i should probably do what's coming up so rain science grow bags said they would do a giveaway for us and i'm verifying that giveaway they're very very nice i don't know why but that's in the mix and that's going down

justin cures for part two of the buddies brand west coast we tour review series for this episode we've got the three bears og cannabis derived terpenes distillate cartridge i've heard it's really good the roommate sells it at mother nature's remedy where we got it it's really delicious so 91.98 on the total cannabinoids and again since i'm an employee of buddy's brand justin here is going to be the official reviewer on behalf of respect my region for this case so thc at 88.5 this is a high potency product brother this is high potency 88.5 yeah that's crazy 91.98 basically 92 cannabinoids i mean terpenes listed on the back coming in hot 3.3 yep uh we got the top three are beta-mercene beta-caryophyllene and beta uh osamine i believe that's how you say it osamine muscle i don't know whatever 0.26 on that one point three seven on the karyophylline and 1.62 on the mercy which makes total sense uh since it's an og three bears og is the string uh i have smoked a different i'm sorry i vaped a different batch of this probably about a month or so ago um and it was around 88 on the total award-winning so we're gonna check it out cannabis single source distillate are you ready yeah i feel like uh you know i'm not a big you know pen smoker but i have definitely tried lots lots just about every brand because it's either been handed to me you saw or give it to me or exactly live residentially like even back in the day when it goes to you know where you don't even want to talk about those times medical days yeah medical you never knew before testing and all that um so but right away i look at the color and i'm like yo this is poe because that color just looks it's so nice very beautiful shade of gold that's for sure so you can just look at the color i'm like this is going to get me uh probably pretty stoned this is good i feel like it's going to be harsh though you think so yeah but what i do want to know though is what's what's the cross on this three bears oh gee though that's what's also kind of missing is because that would usually tell you right the genetics information we want to know i think as consumers we all want to know what g's can vary what what is the original strain right there's there's ogs that are like they come out purple there's og's that are very you know stoney there's you know it ranges it says ingredients distilled kettle oil and canna terps that's it simple as that that's it inhale until desired effect is achieved i always recommend four to six seconds system is safe if you're experienced obviously you know i'll do it around the middle minimum i always also like to say if you're less you know experienced go a little shorter we're talking high potency some good clouds right there shout out to buddy's brand battery okay not harsh at all i was actually expecting to be very harsh wasn't harsh do you get the terps i mean yeah that's like smoking a bowl of lg right there wow yeah that's really nice wow almost almost could trick somebody like if you didn't show me the box and said this was live resin i i could have got dude really could have did me are you just let me try this are you saying yes yeah are you are you thinking yeah no i'm saying no i'm saying that i like i said you might have dude me no i'm not saying you would but i'm saying because it is just it's not harsh and it has very good the terps are like there you can tell it's og but um it does have that it does have that limonene and it does have that carryoffaling not my main i guess it does that but then once once i'm like sitting with it i can tell it's this because the vapor is just different it's different than libraries it doesn't have that sweet or you know like live resin has a rounded hit to the end of it versus something sharper yeah just sharper um that's what i need to do too i always do the hit uh out the nose to really get the turf beam profile second hit here this is your score out of 10 hit opportunity so we review for respect our reason review you know presentation appeal color taste potency wow more information would you recommend your experience i'm definitely stunned i'm definitely stoned and man that knows would you recommend i would to somebody who's a big distillate fan yeah that is that this usually ranges from between 37 and i'll keep you 42 that'll keep you lit at disneyland i'm telling you that much yeah this [ __ ] is potent let me hit this up later i feel a head change i feel it behind my eyes like making my eyes lower i feel on the second hit i was like i'm like going back to what i said i'm like no you couldn't do me you can't do me on it like getting it the second time i'm like yeah you can tell that's some really fire disney what are you thinking really exciting really clean for a distillery pen i'm like man that's i'm surprised uh more people aren't talking about uh i want to ask you that like is you know do those are they flat whoever has them for the club oh really wow okay okay people i just i guess i way more than that yeah and and um certainly sometimes i even get like like what you would call like sweats yeah and i'm not so i think this is just really really good distillate you're right yeah you said it a couple times really really good oh hi i can tell i can tell if i were there's no mirror in front of me but my eyes are red for sure for sure right now um let's let me see from color to to overall to the packaging you know once again hey let me know what the three bears og crosses but man i i'd suggest that over anything when it comes to just a pencil that's uh i don't know how else to give it anything but um nine club 9.5 9.5 a little bit more information could help i can't remember well i appreciate you sharing that review my man you know i personally have reviewed so many of these buddies discipline cards i've tried them i've smoked got 100 100 of them at least and i think as of recently you know whether it's the extraction or the source material i think you know we're just seeing a lot more consistency um but yeah you know adding the strain the genetics and some of that information will be a key addition and let me let me say that that this is very honest for me because this is i've tried i mean i could just name like a bunch and gone to so many events where they're letting you try this try this try this trying whatever flavor they're coming out with and again and again it's like a lot of coffee in the sweats you know a lot of harsh products a lot of harsh product exactly and i believe that's where it comes down to you know single source over multi-source i guess right i don't want to see anything and that's what really sets this apart this product apart because you know it's three bears og when you're smoking it it's like i said tasting a bowl of og kush so hats off to that because i appreciate that that's that's really good for some distilling you guys let us know what you think in the comments all right we want to definitely hear you all and of course if you guys have any questions be sure to drop those as well jp here man justin cures respect my region buddies brand west coast we tour review be sure to like and follow respect my region on instagram and subscribe to our youtube channel and of course let us know uh with any product you guys want to see reviewed um send us a dm so we love you guys appreciate y'all we will see you all on the next review peace", "v3YBD10tzT4": "[Music] is this all in this this times box it must have been right wow what's my intro i have an intro i don't have an intro i never having to drive this problem every time the do i say it will start i didn't see you coming yeah i'm getting a little crunchy around the edges okay everybody this is the february nightclub box so okay okay i'm good i'm good i got this all right no i got this i got this i got this all right hey guys it's march but this is february's box and as you might be able to tell i already opened it and tried everything inside so this time a little bit more of a review than an unboxing but you know we'll make it work uh first thing you might notice first thing i noticed is the new box um you know we've seen them do a pride box uh christmas box this one for february black history month is partnered with the last prisoner project and it's covered with the names of people who are still in prison for non-violent cannabis related offenses which is ridiculous because i can sit here on the internet and actually consume cannabis that i bought legally and some people are still in prison for it so i really appreciate that and if you're interested in that you should go ahead and check it out but i'm just going to be talking about cannabis for the rest of this video so let's get right into it the one thing i didn't try right from the start and i tried right before the video which is currently uh you know kind of doing its thing is this hint of lemon cannabis infused thc powder drink mix by chill with l um as far as i can tell it has no chill um this is fast probably only drank it about half an hour ago and it's good my mood's elevated i'm feeling like something's going on i will say not the most delicious thing i mean i see why they called it a hint of lemon and a lemonade or lemon-based beverage or anything like that because it uh yeah mostly just tasted like lemon thc um but went down easy uh doesn't appear to have any serious amount of sugar two grams um yeah so i'd say if you if you like drinking your cannabis more than eating it and you don't like how long edibles usually take i think about checking this one out that's a hint of lemon by chill so while i'm on the topic of this one i'll talk about the other edible i got last month right here and you can see it's in the nug club colors so it's like a direct nut club collaboration with corolla and this is their cannabis infused 100 milligrams of thc chocolate dipped cookie now that's a lot that's a lot even for me the uh the packaging recommends splitting it in four and i gave it a try that way myself and i can tell you that within two hours heavy heavy effects so despite the fact that it is the ned club branded and just a single package cookie which i thought maybe meant it was like white labeled and not that great it was it was excellent it was really strong and it was a good cookie um these cannabis infused cookies for some reason always come out a little dry in my experience and this one was the same which is probably why they dipped it in chocolate um that gave it a very nice mouth feel compared to just crumbly ready thc um so i'm not sure if this is something that's going to be going on indefinitely if it was a one-time thing or if you can even find this specific cookie not through nudge club but if you have the opportunity to get it as an add-on i'd highly recommend it um i think it's probably a great value uh the only pain in the butt is of course it's 100 milligrams you got to be careful you got to split it up and it's a cookie you can like precisely divide that unless you got out of scale or something so you're going to be rolling the dice a little bit and if you get a little over eager and eat the whole thing you may be in for quite a wild ride so yeah corova nut club cannabis infused chocolate dipped cookie white chocolate by the way that makes a big difference do you okay then the remaining four items are all vapes which i've mentioned before are my absolute favorites so this boxes mix of things i'm a huge fan of i got kind of everything i wanted i got some edibles to try out see some new things and i got more than enough vapes to last me through the entire month of february i actually haven't even opened one of them so we can start there this is california diamond sauce which is as you can see a standard 510 threaded uh vaporizer cartridge with a kind of golden colored concentrate in there it clocks in at 76.9 thc with 83 total cannabinoids and it was packaged july 19th uh so not not too long from there to here um yeah yeah yeah i've gotten both a battery and uh concentrate from california before through node club and i liked both of them i thought they worked great their styles really cute if you see it's it's this very kind of colorful block printed nature inspired kind of deal so i haven't tried this one specifically i have every reason to believe it's going to be excellent um [Music] yeah yeah california sauce the strain was not given i guess it's a diamond sauce is it okay so onto things that i have tried uh this guy we've seen before last month also got a friendly farms uh vaporizer cartridge this month got a different flavor this one is cushman's which is a hybrid and it comes in at 71.4 percent thc packaged back in december 2020 and so again like didn't come straight to me but like still before its expiration date which is december 2022. now the friendly farms cartridge last month i was really prepared to be upset about it and say it didn't work i had issues with it it was trash but i reviewed their cute little literature that they send with every single one of their cartridges and it says in a big bold warning at the bottom that's red and boxed uh using a battery with the wrong voltage can result in an unpleasant cannabis experience and i would characterize my experience with this uh product as unpleasant i had it on this cobra battery which goes from three to four volts and according to this little guy you need to use a battery that is under 3 volts so i overheated it and exactly as they kind of say the oil ended up with a harsh or burnt flavor and i went to the cartridge really fast i actually um ended up seeing the fact that it was getting burnt i didn't realize why uh but if i take here's this month's friendly farms uh there was a clear like color differential showing up around the intakes little dots of like almost black city looking stuff so if you're having problems with a friendly farms cartridge or really any uh cartridge where you're seeing that burning at the bottom and the taste is off it might be the voltage on your battery and it might be a good idea to turn it down uh that said according to these guys the cartridge can even burn itself out and cease to work as well which is not something i knew could happen so learning things all the time um but this month i put it on a smaller battery one that does not get up to four volts and uh had a much better experience with it i'm still not um i'm not super impressed with the amount of vapor it puts out actually obviously it's a lower voltage so it's not going to be the same as some cartridges i can use with the 4 volts but even with that it it's kind of a weak drop but the product is really strong so that's not much of a problem i don't have a big issue like getting the dose i want out of this guy so i guess mixed feelings on friendly farms they're super upfront and they taught me something about how cartridges work but it's also a little unusual that most cartridges i receive will work uh all the way up to four volts and work great all the way up to four volts and this one was on the verge of self-destructing with that same product so if you got a friendly farms one and you have a couple of different batteries i'd recommend rotating through them and making sure you get one that actually matches up with the voltage that it needs all right now vastly less complicated are disposable so you don't have to worry about that because you don't plug it into anything and that's what we got here from leyon an all-in-one vaporizer i actually bought one of these not from nug club years ago to take with me to a music festival and i thought it worked great for that purpose it's [Music] a really cute looking unit in this orange with gold polka dots and it says lean and gold on the side one side has a hole in it the other side has a little led and the flavor was pina daydreams like a pina colada sort of thing and i came through really strong it's been a long time since i've bought a flavored vape or even like received one through node club so that was kind of surprising i've been used to sort of these um like live resin mixes and like pure distillates the diamond sauce uh those come through with kind of a plant material uh sometimes bordering on like chemically dryer sheets vibe this one definitely tasted like like a pina colada like really strongly um like if you vaped off a hit of the flavoring from like a pina colada snow cone but uh what was what made this one different than all the other ones and even some that i've got before it wasn't that strong it's actually only 55 thc but fully 29 cbd so they bill it on here as like a two to one thc to cbd ratio and i really liked that it was a very mellow effect it gave me a lot of the sort of relaxation and body heaviness that you might expect while leaving my head pretty clear to do whatever one to do um so i really liked that it was actually um i've mentioned before i always go for the disposables first when i open the box so this is the first one i went through also just because it was the weakest and i like to like sort of start low and ran my way up to the stronger ones um but i really liked it it was probably probably my favorite new thing i got i would say just cause effects i hadn't seen before and it was fun to have the flavor thing i probably wouldn't choose this particular flavor again it was kind of a lot for me um but i liked it i really liked it i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a all-in-one vape that isn't too heavy and is not going to give you a lot of like paranoia sort of things um came in this really cute metal tin and uh yeah i believe now it says liberate that's not really a flavor but a variety sometimes you get those on pre-rolls and things too yeah leon pina daydream and lastly which wins my award for coolest packaging of the whole box is this also metal really badass looking uh tin from centurion which is you can see their little logo there um now they say aim high it's our way of life so a little hard to take them seriously but assuming it's tongue-in-cheek i kind of like that vibe it's it's goofy um you squeeze the package and this tin slides open and says the clarity you've been looking for and then the cartridge was sitting in there and they've got some nice instructions on how to screw a cartridge onto a battery in case you're very confused and if you remove this uh it says head stash in this little tin so clearly they kind of want you to up cycle it and hold on to this so that's always nice in terms of the product itself what what is this well it's billed as an indica and they did not give a strain but it is fully 90 thc so far and above from a thc standpoint the strongest one we've gotten in quite some time and i would agree with that in terms of my personal subjective experience of this this is a strong this is a doozy this causes the classical cannabis experience you're going to be laughing you're going to be a little sleepy a little sedated moving a little slower so if that is what you're looking for and you want the most rapid and intense way to get there this is this has got to be one of them um i threw it on my cobra extracts battery here and you can see it's a pretty unique cartridge it's clear at the top in the mouthpiece and i've used about three quarters of it but down here at the bottom the liquid itself is borderline just translucent it has maybe like a slight tinge to it but it it it was basically a clear liquid so that's probably due to how purified it was yeah yeah yeah i don't say a lot about the process but you don't get up to 90 thc without pulling a lot of stuff out so this one moving very much uh in a different direction than these like live resins we've seen before that are trying to replicate the exact experience of a specific strain or plant this one just thc and also interestingly enough it was kind of flavored like like a watermelony flavor to it very faint um but definitely not something that felt like it occurred naturally in a cannabis plant i guess like literally this color like it tasted like this weird magenta here um but i liked it i liked it um yeah so awesome package centurion's a brand indica is the variety and it's a one gram vaporizer cartridge so this month i got one two three four vapes and like i said this one was a full gram these two half grams this guy uh 250 milligrams um in the past i've usually gotten about 1.5 grams of vape stuff split across everything so this is actually more than i usually get really showing the value in the box um i pay a little under 130 uh every month for this whole thing and i feel like just getting maybe the centurion this cookie and this diamond sauce at a club would probably cost you about the same amount so i cannot recommend enough the savings let alone the chance to try out some cool weird things um yeah yeah that's the most box thanks for watching use my referral code in the video description or probably i'll throw it on screen somewhere if you'd like to get your own box for 20 off first box only you've got to live in southern california and you've got to be over the age of 18 but beyond that check it out uh all right chill okay well wow it's like a crystal light packet live focus is having some interesting trouble with the glass i'm not gonna lie [Music] it's not uh it's definitely a hint of lemon as it says just lemon flavored weed water but like um like a lemon hit candy lemon not like a real lemon i don't know why i poured so much water said 10 to 12 ounces of liquid and i trusted them based on the size of this [Music] they're just tricking you into being hydrated there's actually no weed but you will feel better oh yeah it's organic grape and fruit sugars citric acid vegetable juice coloring sunflower lectin that's giving me the uh the mitch head break joke i met a wino and he was buying grapes i was like not yet gotta wait man [Music] are you more or less angry now that that was actually silly enough i think i'm less angry we'll check back in in uh 15 to 20 minutes", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "UQ4SGqR74qg": "you hi there I'm Brad today I'm going to try and test some diamonds or what I think are diamonds that I got to Arkansas crater diamond State Park and dug up some gravel brought it home and my wife has kind of gone to it and decided that that the spatula is what she thinks is a most likely to be diamonds so as far as I know there are like about six different tests you can do to determine if they're diamonds there's the old scratch test where you try to scratch a piece of glass with it there's an ultraviolet test where you shine it with a blacklight see fit fluorescence there's also the fog test where you breathed on it and see if it holds onto the fog or not probably can't do this on rough diamonds because it's more for before cut diamonds that have a have a smooth face and then there's electronic diamond testers which I have one of those so we'll tie that basically what that does is put heat into the diamond and then test to see how long it holds on to that heat because diamonds are really good at getting rid of the heat and then a lot of people weigh them so if you have if you have what's a known good diamond that's carat in weight and you have a diamond as you suspect maybe maybe fake and it's also supposed to be carat cubic zirconia is supposed to weigh more than actual diamond so so you cannot test it that way to see if it's fake I'm not going to be able to do that on these rough diamonds because you know obviously I don't have anything to compare them to weight wise and then one one more test that I've seen people do is the laser test where they shoot a laser beam into them just and it diamonds tend to hold on to the light they don't scatter it back out so cubic zirconia well you know scatter light back out of the out of the cut stone so we'll try some of these tests I can't probably do them all but but we'll see where it goes okay laser test so I have these little ones that I know are fakes so I put a cheap tube ain't too laser in there and it bounces right out so but I pretty much knew those are all fakes those are all just pasted this one I think is fake too it's actually these little ones I think might be real but they're still bouncing the D light out but I think that might be because of the there's the settings reflecting the light and the big one definitely you can see the light all come out of there so now for the rough diamonds or rough rough stones some of these are some of these are kind of holding on to the light but that you know they're rough so it's kind of hard to tell a lot of more very clear so so I don't think that they're right not one the look that it's coming right out of it so you think that one is for sure not a real one this one same thing it's kind of bouncing right out of it this one looks pretty good here but again bounces right out of it failing the laser test that one is not this one is very diffused so it's holding on to the light but it's not bouncing around inside of it like you'd expect a diamond to do that one does just shoots right through it that's a piece of glass or something I'm not too sure where my wife found all these stones at kind of the whole family was uh was looking around for stones at the and then you hold a whole bucket of a gravel home I can they're going straight through some of these really clear ones so they're just glass or I don't know or quartz that one is a also bad so these two are the ones that we think are closest to be in diamonds you can see just it they're very diffused though so I don't know if they are so that's it I have a couple more pieces of jewelry that we my wife's where's their diamonds but I don't think they are and you can see it fails the laser test when you hit them with laser beam the light bounces right out of them so you need a couple more here again when they're set like this sometimes it's hard to tell with the laser next test is the scratch test so these all fail the laser tests these all somewhat pass the laser test these fake ones here fail fail the laser test let's do some of these boy not scratching it at all fail the scratch test I don't know that one scratched a little bit not really that one is one of the ones that I suspected the diamond and it to actually pass the scratch test you can scratch pretty good this one halfway past it too hmm do you have to push real hard to get on the scratch so here's my pile that failed the laser test here's my pile that failed the scratch test so I still have a pretty good pile here of possible diamonds the next test would be the diamond tester I have a diamond tester here turn it on you got to wait till it warms up and this lamp here will come on tells you that the heater is all warmed up inside of it so you can send the heat out out the probe to the diamond so there I like came on so now we're ready to test what it says to do is it says to turn this up until it's a at 2 so there's 2 greens here and just for giggles I'm going to test this big one and you can see it goes up to three but it doesn't go on up to four it doesn't go all the way up I have a feeling some of these little guys on the sides of them when it beats like that that means you're touching the metal I can't get in there good enough to get it touch one of those little guys the mounts are messing with me and then these antique earrings that my wife could have sworn were real close her grandma gave them to her are no doubt about it fake they're rubies my possibly be real then they get this little this little ring with the peace opal in it and a couple little diamonds if I can get in here you can see that all the way up and beeps real real noisily so that's got a pair of little small little real diamonds in it and this one's got some sort of sapphire or something in it and if I can get into these guys you can see yeah those light all the way up to so those there's you know eight little stones around there that are real so to get on the test and the rough ones five or six and cure this down to so I I'm thinking that's negative one last test is uh turn the lights off and see if any these fluorescent so these are the ones that passed the laser test these are the ones that fail the scratch test these are the ones that failed the diamond tester and then I'll put my array of jewelry up here too and of course my knowing fake stones just get the lights turned off and get the UV going all right you can see that opals is just glowing like a glowing like crazy and that's it and I've been told that's how they find opals then you got a couple of these a couple of these that are fluorescing to those not so much those might all be fake rubies are supposed to fluorescent for us under black light - and these these are not their darkest can be so I imagine their pace - and none of my stones are glowing so I think it was a bust at the at the diamond mine you", "cj_bEHRZe-U": "hey everybody how's it going today i stopped up at the healing center in monroeville and just so happened they have g leaf special ops coming in at thirty four point five one percent thca i grabbed two eighths and i'm gonna press it right now check it out looks real nice it's frosty and smells the room up something awful awesome so i got a 160 micron bag here from from uh nug smasher branded bag president on my 20 tons crd drip tech rosin press at 200 degrees fahrenheit it's pretty standard for what i do the way i press and i get really really good results of that people will vary on their opinion as to times and temperatures i just watch what the plant does i don't use gauges or timers or any of that stuff i get pretty pretty good results that i can prove over time with my database backed up by videos so hope you guys enjoy this press i sure as hell am we got our bag it's ready to go okay now we're gonna load this thing up centered up here we'll move the camera for you all right so let's do that right there okay all right there we go [Music] and there's our quarter big shout out big thanks to the healing center for having this in stock thank you very much g leaf i love preston special ops it's always been a good producer um let's put the hammer down on this hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical patient the pittsburgh area and you would like me to do this to your dispensary flower and turn your green into gold i do that free of charge always have always will this is my commitment to patients helping patients oh wow this is already already producing i haven't even come close to to it yet look at that special ops get up to the healing center and get you some of that look at that already let's keep going see where else it springs a leak all right power button okay let's get the light in there a little bit better is that a little better yeah okay so let's move that center it back up let's refocus make sure we're right in there where we want to be and dial up the brightness here we go look at what cheese gonna bring us here yep yep there it goes hello oh yeah yeah she is she's a happy girl got some happy trees here oh yeah and you know some people ask well what's what's you know what's rosin good for well rosin is used the same way as any other dabbable concentrate except that this is full spectrum this has everything in the planet nothing was removed except the good stuff and this makes it a much higher quality concentrate than most anything you can buy at a dispensary it comes from flour which is cheaper than the dispensary concentrates you're actually saving money having this process done and look at what happens when you show this plant a little respect and a little love look what she does look what she does look what she gives you and this is what it's all about right here this is the soul of this plant we're bringing it out and we're making better medicine out of it somebody asked me well you know what's better than that you know than just smoking flour and the whole point is you go to the dispensary you spend 60 65 on an eighth of top tier you're gonna take it home and get three joints or maybe two blunts out of it that's half a day's worth of medicating you take that same eight you press uh close to a gram of rosin out of it that medicates you for three solid days for the same 60 65 bucks you just spent on that flower now i don't know about you but i like the math on that you know your money goes three times as far and all of us are hurting right now so that's why i recommend doing this over just buying and smoking or vaping flour and i don't believe anybody really vapes it not on a regular basis anyway but look at just look at that beautiful let's move it over here let's get that look at that now it obviously is auto buttered it's not it's not going to flow like like other things that i've pressed but now you see right here the color starting to darken along the bottom that's it that is all i need to know and i'm done pressing this here we go [Music] hello you liking that as i am definitely like what i'm seeing right now just look at that beautiful medicine right there take it off of here [Music] bring it down [Music] let me uh get the camera yeah let me let me just grab that real quick get this right there all right oh the smell on this is incredible all right here we go let's refocus keep being focused here we go look at that this truck came out perfectly there's no blowouts there's no contamination of the rosin it's exactly the way it's supposed to be now i get a glass container clear clear bottom no that's that's not um all right let's get this up oh it's crystallized up a bit so i'm going to have to be nice and slow about it look at the clarity it's got to be very nice and deliberate with it you know it gets like this what i think this indicates is a lack of waxes and lipids in its profile and that makes it kind of shatter up like this when it's pressed rather than being waxy i'm sure if you pressed it at lower temperatures some people will say yeah precedent lower temperatures yes you can get it to be a little less like this but you're going to lose so much on your yield it is not at all worth it in my opinion now everybody's got their own approaches to this this is mine take it for what it's worth yeah that nice we're just gonna try to knock this right into the jar to stick to the glass and maybe i can pry the tool out of here i'm losing there we go there we go just the color color on this is amazing just gotta treat this a little more carefully because of the crystallization once you get into thicker parts you see how it starts to peel that's a that's what you want to see let's see more of that less of the ground class sort of thing special ops especially at 34.5 percent like this is this that's going to melt your face off it's going to melt my face off let's put that away just look just gotta take your time to get it all up let's take a little extra care with it can't be in a hurry with rosin you just can't that goes for every part of it that goes from picking the string that you feel like will provide the relief you need with enough yield to make it worth doing to how you press it temperature you use and how you gather it up everything has an effect on it so that just looks beautiful just trying to get the last of it off of here yeah close enough [Music] all right look at that color as i stretch it just golden yellow that beautiful now the one thing i'm not going to be able to do at this moment is give you a yield on this because i used a container that i don't have a duplicate for to tear off but that is a very very nice result i will get you a follow-up picture with the yield once i get it out of this container and into a different one thanks for joining me on this video really appreciate you joining me here uh definitely get you some special ops i got it up at the healing center in monroeville stay safe stay medicated be good to each other i'm out", "ktNN_OGa1wU": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today today we're going to be doing a little bit of a review on some mammoth labs LA wedding cake crossed with sherbert OG these are some Terp diamonds done by mammoth labs very high quality concentrate this is coming out with a total THC a percentage of 89.9% this is a high-quality concentrate made from good flour with no pesticide used in the growing process this is a hybrid I'm really looking forward to it all right without any further ado alright so here it is this is your mammoth slabs la wedding cake cross with sherbert oh gee I love the rainbow reflective logo they have here it's got a beaker turned upside down dripping oil everywhere absolutely amazing pure cannabis concentrate little hybrid seal sticker right there that you know there's been broken open with all that you think they have put a little more time and effort into meeting these edges up you know what I'm saying look at this backside that hole right there I mean it's made in the USA of course it's from Washington State has to be sold and produced in Washington State this is unlawful outside Washington State but you see right there that step that right there when you put this kind of money into your packaging you want to try to want to try to nail the seams all right that being said let's get this thing open all right the magic does its job and there it is all right that is some very nice-looking extract pop the lid off this is a hard plastic lid much harder than the softer silicone of some other products this is the new farm so I'm being a little bit picky at it has a very nice earthy aroma to it I'm not getting much of the wedding cake but a little bit of the funk from the sherbert alright that is some very nice-looking stuff all right the only a very turbid crystalline in structure a nice little rock right there all right well this has a some numbers here looking at about eighty percent THC THC am eighty nine point nine but total cannabinoids of eighty point eight for no pesticides were used in making this this was extracted with pho pho alright grow browse where the producer and the processor all right well I'm excited about this one and I'm looking forward to trying it out let's get this topside see we've got to work with so here we are back on top with our mammoth labs la wedding-cake cross with sherbert OG I am really excited about this this is the first time I'll be trying this product there are a new vendor to our store and I always get excited whenever I get to try something new especially something that has a lineage like wedding cake and sherbert two of my all-time top strains that being said you saw when it was down there this has extremely nice crystalline structure has a very wet Terp appearance and this is running a THC a percentage of 89.9% very nice no oh let's get a good smell on this too we're working with oh very nice ah has has has gone to a a very very subtle skunk mixed with a little bit of wood kind of an oakiness kind of a skunky funky oakiness but on the high end you can taste just a little bit of that would be the sherbert that funk that you're smelling there from the top lid you get just a little bit of a almost lemon but really a vanilla just a hint that's the wedding cake very complex but it is actually it is nice it's there both of those should come out really well in the in the innovate very nice light color extremely crystalline structure it's not the easiest to work with if you don't have a scoop but I think everything else is gonna make up for that let's try this out Cheers mammoth labs wedding cake crust with server doji turf diamonds very smooth hmm with that second one that wedding cake really comes out a lot the funk it book rules it over right in the beginning get a conservative a ver then on the exhale went on the reflection kind of a little bit of sweetness very nice um well this it's a very complex product but they did it very well um these guys really got some nice packaging they got some nice product I hope they stick around for a while oh I look forward to trying some of the other stuff that's for sure hmm well you guys have an absolutely beautiful day thank you so much for tuning in looking forward to seeing you next time this has been John was easy kind of source peace how's everybody doing this is John with CNC connoisseurs I'm a got a good one for you today alright well today we're gonna be doing an opening up some [ __ ] and I don't know what the [ __ ] it is Terp diamonds CBD camera it's a 2.84 the total THC a of 89.9%", "iNT1Z200ZK4": "[Music] yo yo i'm drew gilchrist and if you've been watching me for a while you know that i actually really like my wax i know i don't smoke a lot of wax on the channel i don't really talk about wax a lot but if you watch the live streams you know when i do have some wax that i like i absolutely love it and my favorite type of wax is either butter or sauce with like diamonds hopefully so it really excited me when the goods hit me up saying hey man we're gonna make our own line of diamonds and turp sauce so i'm super hyped about that because i've never seen a cbd wax have that before also i think youtube [ __ ] over videos that have cbd in the title or descriptions or tags so that's why the title of this is just legal diamonds and terp source because that's the only way i think i can make this video where it'll actually still push it out to everyone who watches my channel oh yeah just before we get into this video as well i wanted to let you guys know that i'm actually doing a giveaway with the goods on instagram right now well i say right now it'll go up about two hours after i post this video so go on my instagram follow me turn on post notifications so that way you can see this giveaway so i'm giving away a my tv you know the mighty vape like the best dry herb vape in the world so definitely definitely check out my instagram anna let's get on with the video so i've got these two diamonds in turp sauce and i must say they're really different to each other so this is the first one that i actually got this is like totally unbranded they were just like hey man have a look at this one so this is actually forbidden fruits now also if you know me you know that i am not a big fan of forbidden fruits and this one also looks really different you can see it's in the turp sauce and everything but the actual wax itself doesn't really look like you know the diamonds that you know and love and also when i smell it it's so crazy fruity i can imagine somebody who like really likes fruity flavors would absolutely love diving on this but i am not the biggest fan of forbidden fruits so i messaged them and i was like hey look it's all good you know you guys sending me over some diamonds and turn sauce but have you got any other ones so i got them to send me over this one which i'm not actually sure what strain this is but i've smelled it and it is like the gassiest thing in the world let me uh let me pop this open and have a little smell of it so the way i would describe the smell on this is it kind of has that gassy smell like you know when you get a bit of weed that almost smells a bit like diesel a bit like fuel it has that type of gassiness to it but then it smells a bit like an apple almost like the core of an apple if that makes sense oh that smells really nice yeah really that is that is actually the perfect way to describe this it does literally smell like you're taking an apple and mixing it with that gas from bud well i guess we're going to dab some of it up and see how it feels see what we're saying also i must say compared to the other one this looks like normal diamonds in terp sauce like that looks like a normal tea oh my god almost fell out but isn't that crazy isn't that what normal thc diamonds in like normal type sauce looks like it's kind of crazy and also i guess the terp sauce part of the diamonds is gonna be exactly the same as what normal terp source is because turps are legal right i guess terp source at that point does have some of the thc in it and i guess it's probably i don't know is term source extracted in the same way as terpenes like is turp sauce in diamonds just terpenes added onto the diamonds or is terp sauce in diamonds there from part of the extract to make the diamonds that's actually just blowing my mind right now because i'm kind of thinking that most diamonds in terps sauce are just you know they have the turps added back in afterwards but now i'm thinking about it i don't think they are maybe not i'm not really too sure i'd love to know the answer that in the comments down below i never thought about that but i guess we're going to dab some of this up and see what this is like and have a little taste of it and i'm pretty excited for that really sorry for the like charred marks on my banger i don't have any iso left i need to order some as soon as possible all right oh that smells really good it really does smell like apples you know if they if they told me that this was apple fritter i'd be like yeah i'm not fair enough this is about what i'm gonna do i have absolutely no idea if you can see that or not the term sauce doesn't make it sticky so it was actually really hard to put it on that side of my dabber i really should have put it on the other side of my dabber all right cheers people [Music] wow that was crazy nice that tasted absolutely [ __ ] amazing so the last time i did one of these cbd reviews a lot of people quite rightly so said that i didn't tell people what the effects were now the reason i didn't really say what the effects was because obviously cbd doesn't give you that same high as like thc does like i can't sit here and tell you like whoa that diamond's dab got me so blazed right because that wouldn't be the case but with these cbd dabs you do still get the effects from the terpenes and cbd itself is a relaxant so it relaxes your body not not in like the same sort of psychoactive highway but it does make you relax but the terpenes can give you effects from all sorts of places because the difference between strains like in the effects is from terpenes right and we just dabbed on basically 30 terpenes in this and i must say i feel quite good i feel quite uplifted i feel like quite awake especially as soon as it's like first thing in the morning i feel really nice and relaxed from the cbd side of things i feel really good i actually feel like i just dabbed on some sativa or something i feel really [ __ ] good and the taste was banging i think all around that was a really really nice experience i'm really really glad they sent me over that new one and i didn't just have to try the forbidden fruits one also right now on instagram i'm doing a giveaway with the goods actually i think it might go up like two hours after i post this video so if it's not up when i post this make sure to follow me on instagram because we're giving away a mighty vape you know the mighty the best dry herb vape in the world like you know the thing everyone goes on about yeah that mighty so if you want to get that definitely follow me on instagram turn on the post notifications so you know when i post this has been really really great i really really enjoyed that diamonds and sauce honestly is the best thing i think i've dabbed on coming out of the goods um as of right now so so safe from people for being here i live stream every single day on twitch at 9pm as well usually i don't livestream on fridays but i mean with lockdown and everything sometimes i am so make sure to check that out as well follow all my socials the link for everything will be in the pinned comment down below and also for the goods as well so uh definitely see you guys in a bit peace out and um [Music]", "FoQ6o3Akpvc": "hey guys what up its apex today oh excuse me I am very high off of this review this thing we're reviewing mm-hmm we are reviewing G Leaf Wi-Fi glue shatter now this is suppose this is sold under a shatter nah it's not shatter it's the consistency I would say of what wet wet batter if I can speak it is saying it is a hybrid testing at seventy nine point twelve th c0 CBD and Cara Fein and whatever you know what just look on it on my Instagram links down below literally just look at the terpene profile like right here the one that says 3.12 yeah that's the one that's really probably doing it for me in the stream but as I said this is more the consistency of a wet batter I literally went to go and like bold it yeah I got that all over my fingers and it was super sticky I had to like get my titanium not my die teeny and my dynamap like literally scoop it off so I threw it this hole after getting like a little scoop out for to use all was well I was still thinking about it I put the rest in the freezer which I do recommend for this is definitely put it in the freezer before you start to use it now look at that that's that's all we're gonna hit right today where are you no not today well for the review well I am really really really okay well there we go we'll do a coke for this we'll do a do it what is it called cold start dad yeah and it does smell really good I'm not gonna lie very late peppery is very peppery smelling and it smells on this like a green pepper mix we wake up with like a jalapeno smelling on those anyway guys let's get this dad born [Applause] um I will see this from using this it's a very um it hit your head a lot more like more like an indica would an indica hitting head hi Elise for me on this is something that I would say if you wanted to hit before you went to bed this would definitely put you to sleep because um I've been definitely taking weed naps off this it is very very potent um the head high though I would say is more of like expanding it's like oh it's like you know to sleep um it's almost like you're like seeing a white light and like as soon as you pass through that white light you're knocked out from and that's okay I'm really stuttering [ __ ] me but I would say I like this string makes you stupid but I love it it's like stupid pass out stupid I love it this is something I would definitely take it's like a nighttime strain to go to bed which I'm going to do right now so anyway guys this has been real and see on a next review", "m7KL8hFXEAU": "what's up everybody it's your boy mastermind here with ohio cannabis live and we're back for another review video i'm trying to reach 1000 subscribers so please go ahead and now hit the like and subscribe button and sit back and enjoy the review another mastermind hit [Music] what's up everybody it's your boy mastermind good morning happy to see you guys again today we're talking about full spectrum tac diamonds and sauce by standard wellness and this is my first review using my new studio system so i hope everything will go well so this is live this is not pre-recorded so we are here so the first thing i'd like to do is start off with what exactly is diamonds and salts so let me just show you what i looked up on the internet here we go so probably the hottest product category on the mainland market this product is also known as terp sauce diamonds or just sauce noah's diamond sauce a high counter void spectrum salt this is according to noah's cares so this is just some website i found on the internet and they basically say that it's you know a full spectrum extract containing thc a crystals drenched in terpene rich potent sauce a beautiful blend of thc crystals and terpenes to vape let's look specifically some information relevant to our product here in ohio you know me i like to have all the facts so let's look at the lab report for this product here so as you can see here this is the standard wellness diamonds and sauce uh durbin is the string that we're working with here and on this lab report as you can see we're given a lot of information we're given the cannabinoids some of the cannabinoids listed here are cbga thcv which i haven't seen before tacv is in victory again with a added to it i have not seen that yet and we also have some delta nine as well and of course taca and just a little tiny smidget of cb c is in charlie a the total tac here on this product according to the batch is 608 milligrams of tac there is no cbd and as you can see as far as pesticides microbials mycotoxins solvents foreign matter and heavy metal this product passed all those when we look at the terpenes specifically we have a turpentine earthy and a hops type aroma and to be more specific about the terpenes we have a terpeneine uh cuane mercinine and kerophyllene limonene and pinea are some of the primary dominant terpenes that are currently available when you look at the second page of the analysis which i like to be complete here we get a more specific uh list of some of the pesticides that were checked for and as you can see standard did a very very good job of making sure there's no pesticides in here there is some residual solvents but they're all within the proper parameters so it passed on all those um no no microcobials were detected and no heavy metals were detected um and if there was it was a .004 of lead detected which still was in the safe threshold and it passed so you know standard is trying to make sure that they're being transparent by providing patients with access to the certificate of analysis thank you standard for doing this this helps us know that the product is safe and did a lab did actually go through and make sure this is safe the current lab they used was the act testing lab now let's move over to the actual unboxing and let's take a look at what we got here oops that's that thing about the live so as you can see the box is labeled diamonds and sauce full spectrum meaning that this is going to have all your terpenes in it that's what full spectrum means some things are not full spectrum as you can see the extraction process with hydrocarbonation derived and you know right now the label tells you a lot of basic information uh you can see uh the price here was 75 hours i did purchase this at bloom medicinals in columbus so shout out to them uh i'm not sure if they still have it anymore uh but 75 hours and this was almost a full gram the net weight was 0.96 so just a little bit shy of a gram um packaging isn't too difficult to open um all you need to do is just have a knife or razor blade handy to cut the little seal part there as i'm showing you here oh i forgot to cut the top oops here we go uh now i've got cut the top and this slides right out and here we have this black card they have in there doesn't really have any significance just to keep everything nice and tidy here is our product and there's also a little generic scooper dabber tool that no one ever uses but the state requires state of ohio requires us to use this to make sure that we're getting the right dose and it is a pretty good dosing tool if you don't have one now here's the goodness now as you can see this does look kind of like live resin but the difference is the diamonds are those chunkier blocks you see inside the salts and the sauce is in there and when i first saw it i didn't even realize that those little lumps in there were actually hard little diamond rocks until i scooped one of them out and i said so um you are going to stay tuned so you can see me uh try some of this out and you can see my real-time reaction so like i said um you know packaging you know i'm gonna give them an a plus on that appearance i'm gonna give them a b plus um maybe it could be a little bit lighter maybe it's my lighting but it still looks good and it smells great so here we are to your favorite part of the show when you actually see me uh do this stuff so here we go wish me luck here all right so i'm going to be using a pax 3 vaporizer many of you seen me use this before in conjunctions with my bong here you know it wouldn't be a test without a without a water test right all right so what i suggest is that you make sure that you set your packs to the temperature that you are comfortable with for a number of reasons you want to make sure that you don't burn up your terpenes and you also want to make sure that you don't burn your throat temperatures does matter so i'm gonna go ahead here's the stuff just so you can see that i am using the same thing you saw in the video i'm gonna go ahead and get a nice diamond out this is for you this diamond is for you guys and i'm going to show it to you and you're going to be able to see there is the diamond on my dabber and then i'm going to take my pax oven right here and i'm going to go ahead and take that guy and put them in there now it's it's got a little sauce around it but it's not dripping with sauce storage wise i recommend you store this in a cool dry dark place definitely keep it out of direct sunlight and always make sure you clean your dab stick before using this make sure you clean your packs as well you don't want anything to get inside of your your concentrate and contaminate your concentrate with foreign matters that could be terrible you don't want that to happen and like i said with the pax it does have a less than 30 second warm-up time i keep mine on the third light if you've seen many of my videos the highest is 420 so i'm keeping mine about 370 degrees that way i can make sure i get flavors so here goes my first impression i haven't had no other medical cannabis today this is the first thing this is the waking bake for all those true stoners out there you know what the waking bake is so i have a green light my pax is ready here we go let's go to the up close reactions all right first thing is i'm definitely tasting the terpenes right away thing about doing concerts hey father time thank you for commenting you're showing me i'm sorry you're out of days my brother it's a just 16 days away i i know that's a little bit of time for for you man but i'm i'm just praying you'll be able to get through man i really appreciate you being here this morning you're actually the first person to comment on my first new live video with the new system and it is showing me here that the system is working so thank you for doing that i really do appreciate your support father time bout time has been one of my loyal viewers in all the times that i go live i always see father time on here so thank you for your support sir and those who are watching this on the replay because you're busy i appreciate your support too and uh make sure that you go ahead and smash that like button share this video when you're with your friends share the link to your friends share on social media diamonds and sauce has arrived like i had said before i i think that this is uh definitely a a product that is you know something a lot of people in the market were looking for a lot of other states that have legal cannabis have diamonds and salts obviously the tac might be a little bit higher than ours ohio caps theirs at 70 percent or 590 milligrams of tac and there's a five percent variance so that's why their theirs was just a little bit over and you know for ohio processors making concentrates is really hard hey hey yo yo good to see you good to see you here cheers to you awakening bacon so overall like i want to just let you know for medicinal purposes um diamonds and saws is going to be really for those people who want something really strong and you know again i recommend you use this in mid day or evening time because it is a very strong thc product and if you feel like you've tried this product and you're overwhelmed the best thing to do would be to add some cbd thank you thank you mr uh dirk i really appreciate your support here and i'm glad to see that my comments are working i've worked really hard i spent 48 hours non-stop trying to make sure that this will work for you guys so you guys can have a more enriched experience and i want to make sure that when i do these videos i am giving you useful and true and factual information so when i look at this from a cerebral effect this doesn't interfere with my concentration um so you know definitely don't try to operate heavy machinery however this may get your conversational flow going with your friends um and like i said if you have already tried this product i would certainly love to hear what you think about it and again i did purchase it from blue medicinal columbus but i am aware that this product is available in other places and again the strain name that i have is durbin they also have a headband which i think is very good and uh you know i'm gonna go ahead and get this water test in here with you guys with the last bit of the oil you know how that's how we do it here on ohio cannabis live 420 live ohio y'all already know and uh you know if i've given my opinion i recommend this product if you're in the concentrates now if you are still new to concentrates this may not be the product for you to try just yet until you have practiced a little bit more um as far as consistency and handling i think it's very easy to handle it's not messy as long as you keep it stored in a cool place or you could keep it in a chiller um just just realize if you do keep it in a chiller and then you get ready to use it you might want to let it rest for a few minutes about five ten minutes so that it'll be a little bit easier for you to stab into it with your dab stick um but yeah i think that this is a good product and uh congratulations standard for getting this product to the market and again i appreciate you guys being here with me today and i hope that you have a really happy holiday make sure that you wear your mask out in public to stop the spread of the virus the numbers are rising and i will see you guys on the next video peace another mastermind hit you", "zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "R5uGi4EOHGw": "[Music] hello my friends welcome back to my channel diamonds and washi this is katie and if you're new here hi welcome i hope you'll consider subscribing if you liked today's video and if you are back welcome back today we are doing a post review of one of my latest completed projects and that is mighty river from diamond dots and their brand new square kit square drill kit line so look at the finished effect of this beautiful painting um look at the level of sparkle that diamond dots is very very much known for with their drills so this is actually the very first diamond dots kit i've completed at all not just my first square kit from them but as i mentioned the name of this one is mighty river which it does show here at the bottom the design size on this one is 52 by 34 centimeters it does measure true to size and it is legally licensed and this is a stock image that they licensed through shutter stock so diamond dots does legally license all of their images which is nice and um i was able to find this actually in store i was just walking through a joanne's which is a crafting and hobby store in the united states and saw that they had a few of diamond dots new square kits in stock and thought i would pick one up to give a try so this had 32 colors and one of those was an ab it was a white ab that is sprinkled very liberally through the sky here and through the river as well and i think adds just a nice little extra sparkle here i'll let you guys take a look up close if you're not familiar with what a b stands for it stands for aurora boreal aurora borealis and what that means is it's uh you can see how those drills there are extra sparkly and shiny um that just means that they've placed an extra coating on the top kind of an iridescent coating and sparkles even more than the regular drills already do sort of picks up the colors around it and has almost a little bit of a rainbowy effect that it throws off so i loved that in this kit i thought that that was a really really nice touch and really enhanced this kit quite beautifully speaking of the drills the drills in this kit were easily one of the very best things about it um diamond dots is known at least i had heard a lot about how they're known for having really really sparkly and really good quality drills that was absolutely the case for me even with their square kits so that's not just exclusive to their round kits there's very very little trash uh in the drills at all the abs i thought were especially nice um compared to maybe some other companies i felt like these this a b coating and i just accidentally popped a drill off there um the a b coating on those i thought was uh just a little bit more full than we see on some a b drills from other companies it just it coated it really nicely all over uh interestingly enough i had had several people warn me that in their experience diamond dot strolls were extremely staticky when they get up i had zero static when i kitted these drills up at all it was actually the least static i've had in my drills in quite some time so i don't know if they use a different manufacturer for their square drills or if it just was luck of the draw but i had no static issues with the drills that kitted up super quickly super easily while we're talking about drills um i mentioned this over on my instagram account but i want to show you guys here as well i noticed something super interesting about these drills when i was working on this kit so in case you weren't aware typically with square drills there are a couple of different ways that the top is cut that it's faceted really and it typically is cut there's usually two or three different ways that they'll cut the tops of the drills and it just has sort of the effect of giving a more i don't know overall sparkle i suppose maybe it's just part of the manufacturing process but with diamond drops square drills if you take a look look at the facets on the top they are identical on every single one of these drills i think it makes for a really fascinating effect and i like the overall effect and it's so striking because you don't see that in other kits let me show you the light drills as well they're all cut the exact same way on the top so i mean it might not necessarily be everyone's cup of tea but i really enjoyed the effect of it at least with this piece so that was interesting just thought i would point that out to you guys as well something else i enjoyed about this piece was just the overall finished effect i thought was nice especially for the size this is on the smaller side i thought the canvas was a nice material and i sort of i kind of liked this effect on the border where i don't know if diamond dots does this with all of their kits i know that dreamer designs does it with their kits but there's this border that's added on the side that i suppose is just to sort of give it a matted or framed look and just make it feel a little bit more complete it's a really interesting effect and i'm guessing you probably either love it or not so much i like it i think it works for this piece pretty well so um something else that i've mentioned this already but i'll mention it again just as far as something that i liked and what i like about diamond dots kits in general is one of the most important things to me about diamond painting kits is that they're legally licensed and not using unlicensed artwork from artists and essentially stealing from them so i really appreciate that all of diamond dot's artwork is licensed so i feel you know ethically good about what i am picking up and it's also a huge plus to me that you can get these kits in store diamond dots is one of those companies that is available at several retailers and it they even have availability at retailers in multiple countries if you go on the diamond dots website you can put in the country that you live in and it will give you a list of retailers and in the united states it's most crafting stores have diamond dots and um you can even order them online as well so let me get into some things that i had kind of a tough time with one of the things that a fellow diamond painter had mentioned having an issue with and i did have an issue with as well there's some gapping with the drills and i am a perfectionist this drove me a little bit crazy and i really tried to go back and center them really evenly um so that the gapping wasn't as noticeable but the reality is these drills just did not sit tight at all they uh there's no satisfying click when you pop them together you know filled in the gaps um and there just is visible gapping it's especially noticeable on those light colors like the whites so it's almost like the drills themselves were just a tiny bit too small or the charting was just a tiny bit too large and i would be interested to see that i know square drills are brand new to diamond dots if they continue to you know produce kits and do additional runs i would definitely be interested to see if they could tweak that just a little bit so it's a more overall uniform look because you can even see the gapping down here so at a distance which is kind of a bummer but i mean hopefully it's just a learning curve for them uh something else that was really tough for me was that they're the dark cymbals in the blues especially uh were extremely saturated in particular uh this symbol basically the dark blues uh and even some of the dark greens were saturated to the point of being blurry and frankly it there was a lot about this kit that was giving me really strong deja vu for dreamer designs it's not a bad thing i just i've noticed multiple things about this kit that maybe go is this these the same manufacturers streamer designs i'm actually going to insert a side-by-side picture that i took here of a dreamer designs kit that i own um and the symbols on that kit next to the super saturated symbols on this kit so you could take a look and see kind of what i mean it's that similar effect where it just it kind of hurts your eyes to look at and it's hard to be able to distinguish between the symbols um and kind of yeah be able to tell what you're seeing on the canvas so so one other thing that i was a little on the fence about was um it's nice that they have this border here but this is just a personal preference thing so i'm used to the glue spilling out a bit past the drill field this is poured glue which is nice um but since there was a border there that i didn't really want to cover up with washi tape um it would have been nice if the glue could have been cut just a bit closer to the drill field itself because i definitely found like down here i was getting like fuzz and stuff stuck in that over spill so i ended up putting washi tape i could have done this from the start i suppose i ended up covering it in washi tape while i was working on it and then took off the washi tape after it was finished um but i would still worry depending on how you hung it or framed it if it wasn't behind glass that it would catch dust and stuff and not look very clean so you could take an x-acto knife and cut that and then remove it but that's you know depends on how diy and crafty you're feeling i suppose that is an option so um then just a couple of thoughts on diamond dots in general as far as things that are make me hesitant to buy from them again though i will buy from them again if some artwork speaks to me um one of the things i'm hesitant about is that the artwork that they have available tends to be really sort of limited in options it's uh you either you know have find a lot of things that you love in their artwork like they have a lot of like pets or florals or basic landscapes like this that are uh pretty they have animals um i don't really see them branching out much into like artists artwork it's a lot of more i think stock style photos which is really beginner friendly um and you know i think i love that they're available in stores but i wish that they had a little bit more variety in their selection um and that being said the price point i feel like can be a little bit on the higher side though at least in the united states like when i got it at joann's i got it with a coupon like a 40 or 50 percent off coupon and that made the price point you know much more manageable for me um but i've you know from what i've heard from my international subscribers the price point for diamond dots seems to be a little bit higher because they don't necessarily have access to coupons so i think you kind of have to just look at their selections see if there's something that is speaking to you um and sort of keep in mind that at least with their square drills like i said i haven't worked with their round drills like i said the canvas was really saturated in terms of the symbols and um but the drill quality was really good really sparkly and i love all the abs this is really fun to work on honestly so one thing that i do want to note um because i know this comes up often for people that are working on diamond dots if you save your spare drills when you're done with the project uh diamond dots is different from most other companies if not all their companies and that they use their own proprietary numbering system so and they call it it's a dots they say dq number i'm actually not sure what that stands for but this color this number corresponds to specific colors so the nice thing is diamond dots actually just recently added to their website a conversion chart from the diamond dots codes to dmc so when i go to save these drills while i'm going to keep them in their own separate baggies because of the nature of them that they're all faceted the same way i can at least still put them with their respective dmc code that they go with by looking at that conversion chart and putting in like okay what is 8146 in dmc or the closest two so um if that's something that you want to be able to see i will link the conversion chart in the description below i'll also link this kit on the joann's website below as well as the unboxing that i did of this kit just a week ago um this worked up really quickly it took me just four days i think to finish um there was some color blocking this was mostly confetti and there was a lot of confetti here but there was a decent amount of color blocking and this is a smaller kit so it did work up quickly but feel free to go take a look at the unboxing if you'd like to have a closer look at the canvas before it was complete and hear my thoughts on everything there so what are your guys's thoughts have you ordered from diamond dots before and or tried their square drill kits and if not do you think that's something that you want to try uh either based on this video or otherwise uh and what are your overall thoughts on this finish and some of the overall feedback that i shared with you guys on my experience um as always leave any questions comments or concerns down in the comment section below i'll do my best to get back to them as quickly as i can and uh thank you for watching if this video was helpful please give it a thumbs up before you click away and if you're not already subscribed please consider subscribing i'd love to have you here so i'll let you guys go have a wonderful day and i'll talk to you again soon bye friends", "uiiyBZxyutg": "what's up homie murder bombs small tubes been a minute [Music] we here at the lab you know um yes that well like you can see it there's little circulator running that's recovering a run from the closed loop system but for right now we bounce in a little bit of dry [ __ ] just real quick nothing's nothing special just doing some quick bounce tech let me get that off here so it doesn't contaminate that just doing some quick balance tags you know it's been a long day i've run a little over four and a half pounds and i don't have any hash i mean i have somehow but i want different you know what i'm talking about so how is everybody how's your day going what day is it [Music] okay that's the this is uh 120 through 159 not the cleanest or anything just trying to just trying to get a little something together to rip with you guys oh we can't do it like that can't see [ __ ] um [Music] not bad huh for some midzies so you're looking to learn about some dry [ __ ] mojo jojo well then i i have wonderful news for you i uh i finished uh shooting and there's just a little bit of editing for the um second video in the patreon series and aside from that i had all this uh dressed up stuff out and i had some material that i was working with so i went ahead and shut up oh comprehensive driveshift uh tutorial-ish video really a sort of revisiting because i have uh i watched a couple of bubble man's um old videos and some john brothel and a d420k and i realized my dry sip tack is nowhere near what it should be and um well to give you an idea why i'm feeling okay about it i'll just show you here in a second we pressed some rosin we're gonna show you [Music] and what we're doing [Music] wanted to see what kind of a quality product i can get from this and still um this this will still maintain a pretty a really reasonable view um this is 120 through 1 49 159 dry sift but this is in a 50 micron bag um a little bit larger than i typically use for hash but not too let's see what we got right here again not not to clean just trying to bounce any particulate through the screen that's smaller than 74 micron obviously boom playing drum solos over here [Music] i tried to use the camera last time but i guess you can't focus when you're live on youtube oh [ __ ] can you guys see this not bad for how long you saw we just worked on it 519 canada here shout out to my dry sipped masters from the north marcus of course uh john six grams i don't know i guess i could weigh it should we wear it yeah we can wear it why not oops we do have a little scale right here anyway so shout out to whoever the hell this company is no more batteries [ __ ] it usb rechargeable scale and i charged i've charged it one time and i've been using it for almost a month all right so we're going to weigh this the easy way [Music] make it a little bit of dry ice sit and really i was just bringing you guys in to take a break with me but when i set up the stream i noticed i had all that sift on the screen and i thought you guys might like to watch that hey four grams 3.95 looked like more didn't it all right guys it's good yeah i am tired i'm ready to take a dab i'm not sure how much i'm gonna get done after that but i have put in a very full day all right um [Music] you guys wanna you gotta [ __ ] it i guess we could press this real quick i do have some wonderful things to show you that i pressed earlier today from some dry sift that i spent much more time with um so if this stuff comes out amazing i'm going to be a little bit disappointed because why did i spend all that time making that stuff nah it's just there's absolute technique that cannot be denied and then of course there's the advantage to you know fully mature trichomes very dry fully mature trichomes in a very cold environment with very low humidity i mean in that setting you don't even really have to be this very good at this thing with all your variables perfect like that you're gonna you're gonna get some decent hatch but for uh mojo that said in the comments there a little bit ago about getting some screens or recently got some screens for driving oh what's happening here guys i can feel just a little bit of loose sift that's around it you know i don't want that on the parchment obviously okay now where's the first one the one i'm on i don't know we'll see if we get any yold out of this this actually is some 160 160 to 249. huge very high micron hash i don't think we're gonna press that but hey let's see what happens with this step as a matter of fact i know i want to press this because [Music] we want to try to stream i guess by a little bit of dry slipping i meant a lot sorry sorry sorry let's go let's go let's go [Music] all right here we [Music] that's a go too close how's everybody doing how's everybody doing it was a little fluffy you know what that points to unfortunately a high uh count of a capitate and stocks so that's contentment um only only contaminant would have it looking so fluffy like that we both thought it was like [ __ ] when you said seven grams i was like yeah probably maybe even a little more and then it was half all right guys so we're gonna first press the uh which one is this i can't remember which one was the bigger bag now the bigger bag was the last one so this is the 120-159 this is the 74-119 i think yes this is the 70 419 that's the stuff that we thought was seven grams but it's actually get my big fat head out of your way [Music] [Music] should be ready to go whoa those are some big comments yo what up austin video is called miz uh mecca mccall man static oh yeah [Music] so i don't know who so so dare you you must not have been here for the beginning i was talking about the marcus um adding to your driveshift quiver that i watched about six years ago and then i revisited over this past weekend and it was a really it was a wonderful reminder um no we're not of course i didn't just do static tech i don't have the time for that right now just want to make some dabs [Music] no they're actually four thousand dollars so sorry to i'm sorry to so sir dirty i love your information i appreciate the help and everything but you're a little bit incorrect there brother um yes of course the video at least i well i mean bubble man pro had had published tutorials on full mel dry sift and static tech six years ago so that makes sense as far as the drying being done with a freeze dryer oh yeah sure it's a great way to do it but old school microplaning and and drying um on cardboard honestly if you know what you're doing if you know how to keep your room cool and dry it can be very dope aside from that even whether or not you're freeze drying or not you're going to have to microplane um unless you're just going to stuff chunks of well you know i have no way of doing static technique the same thing as you were thinking security i'd like to check that yeah oh of course we know that's v man yep it is you're absolutely right sir dirty it is very simple the uh well there's the [ __ ] [Music] oh he's always doing it dude that's that's all that's like every single day for solving this bacon big he goes live for like four hours at a time and washes and presses and you know all that that's what's up yeah so depending on if you want a pharmaceutical freeze dryer which for the record if you're going to get one through low temp um and we are we're only talking about harvest rate i am not going to speak on anybody or any other company's freeze dryer if you're going to go through low temp you're not you're only going to be able to get a pharmaceutical one and they're not and that's not 2 000. they do have a small freeze dryer that's like it has three shelves it's very very small if you don't need a pump or anything like that if i remember correctly i think it's uh we could just look it up i think it's like 25 maybe maybe 3 500 but if i remember correctly actually i think the medium one is because i was looking at the medium one with a pump and it was going to be right here just over four just over four grand i'm so interested in that uh [Music] i love it i love it um yeah i'm so interested in this static tech austin what you got what you got that's new yeah you and that's don't even get me started on that oil free clown so you know dope about fire fire driveshift if you accidentally [ __ ] around and get and get caught answering some questions on youtube and just watching your [ __ ] burn there's the 120 micron obviously buttered to hell because how long i let it sit on the press but i don't think it's gonna hurt it [Music] all right let's press the big one and then let's go take a dab and then i need to get the [ __ ] out of here but i like to say dear tate because it reminds me of joe dirk [Music] oh that's right yeah okay a moderator i understand i'm sorry i've been so into reddit lately you guys that it's just usually i mean bops are mostly moderators over there but anyway i get what you mean now you got a blue ranch when you go live with them and you help them keep [ __ ] together [Music] i know homie i'm waiting for my taxes to come back so i can make skunk man austin god damn it yo if you don't know anything about skunk man sam you actually don't even know anything about triceps and sir dairy that's you seem very knowledgeable and i don't mean to say that to be rude but i actually you're pretty knowledgeable so you probably know who scott manson is marcus himself bubble man himself shouted out to scott manson without skunk man sam we would be we'd be a long way behind in the full mount [Music] there we go there we go probably let that guy warm up for a little bit too long but that's okay that's the beautiful thing about pressing at 155 degrees you got a little bit of yeah a little bit of leeway looks like there's a couple of you in here hope you guys are having a good day i am wrapping up my work week we're trying to anyway i'm gonna have to come back tomorrow of course but here we go let's get a little bit of frozen banana dry sip hash rosin glow for you again remember guys i didn't really clean it we certainly didn't break out any static tech we're just trying to get some dabs for me to get going with skunk man sam is the [ __ ] man just i gotta say it again austin you know what's up hey thanks mojo i laven if you're old school weed too you remember brett mavericks using the static tech on a pool table with the playing card brett maverick used mavic was that that's that's long enough static tech ago that that's before uh i was seeing people regularly doing it with books and dvds and things damn see i knew we had some crossover man i love solving this bacon bank he's such a cool dude and you ain't kidding i do need a netflix series and i'm down for that pay too um but he is such a cool dude and i just like what he's about um i of course i'm i'm kind of busy doing the same same similar stuff so because of that you know oh i have the timer set for 90 seconds i'm gonna press a little longer than that it just we're probably about 110 right now um [Music] also i don't want to get too crazy with the pressure because i just want this to be fire i don't really care about you um that's a shitty thing to say yeah but solving this bacon baby's such a he's such a cool dude and he's just he just seems to be so like the thing i some people are like so you could say that but they're just so nice i don't get that with him i get to know [ __ ] from him i like that you don't need to be [ __ ] nice for me to be a fan of yours you need to be about your game and he is he's about his game i just don't know personally i get silly with trying to be nice to everybody again some presses you just don't [ __ ] care about the yield this was on the plant how long ago did we start streaming 21 minutes ago this was bud a little over 30 minutes ago now let's see here's our first press this is our one yeah this is the big microphone i think that stuff's going to be better 35 40 minutes ago for sure this stuff was flour in a plastic bin in a tupperware you know what's that you know what time it is only i had a [ __ ] rig ready over here [Music] better not take forever geez my desk is messy i'm so sorry you guys let's uh just bring you in on about that much of it so you don't have to look right at all oh i know what i want to show you so that's the this is a little bit of frozen banana dressing pass rosin that we just pressed together we made it [ __ ] around with the card didn't that card moved it around a little bit let some of the let's let gravity do most of the work for us and uh there we got those two processors from it i couldn't absolutely get a second press and i will later earlier today what did i press oh this is nightwing so here's some night queen dry swift rosin that i pressed a couple hours ago and this is the second press i never [ __ ] with second presses unless it's good hash good hash will press two sometimes even three times if you're not if you're if you're doing short presses or whatever if you're [ __ ] it out you shouldn't have to press it three times but anyway i just want to share that a little bit a little bit a little with you we got some super fire rosins for dab on and um we made them all from the plant to the parchment ready for the bag and it's just 45 minutes tops where are you where are you oh you guys wanna get silly little slurper dab i just saw the case over here don't do that that's how you lose a marble all right guys i gotta have that gauge up all right how we doing how we doing how we doing just so you know i can't see you and i have no idea what the hell is going on but i love you guys [Music] [Music] all righty then [Music] let's uh let's start this [ __ ] off right i'm going to start it off with that second press from the uh from the night queen oh [ __ ] i forgot that i'm working one thing [Music] and by working i mean taking a break i like to take a break about every six to eight hours yes i do work 12 hour days 10 to 12 hour days today is going to be a pretty short day though i'll be out of here i'll be out here right around 10 hours um anyway yes we'll slow down the recovery there a little bit so i can play with you guys for just a minute come on guys i think i just want to look at the picture of that deer pooping now so again give me something let me know what's up give me something to read in there sir dirty had all sorts of good information i do i hate that i'm so uh contrarian and so oppositional and i'm sorry about that but it seems like sometimes like somebody i mean regardless of whether or not he's right about the price we can agree to disagree or just look it up or whatever but i don't know why i have to oh no you're not right he [ __ ] cares if any of us are going to buy a freeze driver we'll find out by the time we check out you know what i'm saying you know what i'm saying there we go that blazer though all right so we're going to start this off with a excruciating dab of the night queen second press tricep hashgraph oh i barely even smoked last night i certainly haven't smoked anything yet today i've been working for since 10 when it's about 7 30. [ __ ] i'm at nine and a half hours now it looks like it's gonna be more like an eleven-hour day whatever where's that second graph that's not it that's not it that's a good problem to have right you like that you guys this is the other reason why i want to do a dab with a second press to start and you might be able to pick up you guys having fun watching me let me watch when i finally get my youtube page pulled up here on my laptop i'll be sitting here by myself i mean i don't know how anybody wants this [ __ ] i gotta be [ __ ] annoying as all hell but i love you guys and i love sharing my little bits of knowledge about how to make hashish with you well and don't worry guys if i knock this rig over digger gave this one to me um for court sales i want to say three years ago so it's a decent ring but it didn't cost anything surprise says oh that's me right there i was like i call myself a surprise set all right here we go oh that's that's actually a very big dab already cheers ladies and gentlemen oh my god i'm not even gonna be able to dab the president that's some night queen and really it's like trim then keith that i threw over a screen real quick and it was so terpy i almost couldn't even i really whoa that must be good where there's the very turkey dab one of you what whatever mcafee any cheers come on dude my antivirus pop up was cracking the comments and then thank you elite uh 27 m uh 27 32 and four and that's for the regular and that's in us dollars iso um but that's just a regular freeze driver it is a food grade freezer option but it's not the pharmaceutical ones which have way way way more um options and settings that you can play with as far as dry times dry times depth of vacuum temperature sublimation is a really amazing thing got me by the nose it really did too man it's like uh and honestly that's the oh that's the second press um mixed micron or whatever it didn't it doesn't have a very clean melt to be perfectly honest with you i'm a little less than impressed with that there's absolutely no char or particulate or anything it's just a little darker than i think it should know anyway let me set this down over here or not shut this down oh man yo night queen [ __ ] give me a break jesus i have never experienced that strain being that loud before um i i've washed it and pressed it i have some sugar of it it's just amazing but never had that happen jesus this frozen banana [ __ ] looks amazing this is not frozen now that's good man all right there we go now this should be the bee's knees wait that's the night queen again i can't do that it's definitely gonna be good that's the 120. the 120 to 159 oh all right here we go no he said it was 2k for a freeze driver and it's 2700 and if you're in canada that's more like three um so he was off by 50 number one and then number two that's if you if you have a pump if you need a pump too it's more unless i'm mistaken if that's the price with the oil pump the other thing is that anybody trying to get one of these to use it in a setting like i'm trying to use it in is not looking for an oil-free pump the oil free pump is like an extra six to eight hundred bucks so at that point it's 35 for the small one and for the record that freeze dryer is so [ __ ] small you're gonna be pissed at yourself for spending three thousand dollars on something that small when you could have spent four thousand on something that is significantly better but still goes back to my point i just i don't know why i always got to be right anyway that's fair and honestly that's the thing is if it's a thing to waste and you're like a hobbyist or whatever damn you're really going in on your hobby but for me i look at it as like well why would i spend two to three grand on something that then when i recoup the value for it it's too small so i mean um freeze dryer is on the schedule not sure what size i'll be getting but we'll see you know what's up it really does man what kind of class is on a dab right what would i say and then aside from that hello annie yeehaw right man damn i [ __ ] but i'm almost scared to go in on another job but we got but number one i need to wrap it up and number two come on jesus man i got dab sweats and [ __ ] my gloves all hashy man jesus and my hands are clammy now because they were in the glove that's probably why i was so hot it couldn't have anything to do with that dab i just took i'm sure it had to do with the gloves all right ladies and gentlemen you know how much i love you um i mean if you don't know who's being silly if sir dirty's still here let's haven't seen a comic i'm gonna walk but if you're stupid still here looks like we're going to split the difference um we're both no i mean to be fair i don't know i don't know actually i don't know about that before i think i just said they're not too um but also i was speaking about the pharmaceutical freezer regardless it is the morton salt girl except it's the morton salt girl taken and done by slinger which marble slinger is a glassblower but then he takes it and he puts an assault rifle in her hands and we have a salt girl that makes sense and this is a special february edition this one's called oh this one's called rain and blood that's right that was the other thing the slayer rain and blood um yeah i love slinger [ __ ] um but this is a this is the picasso version of the design super cool first time i saw it i was like that's like a morton salt girl and then i realized he's holding a gun and i'm like a salt assault like a salt oh god and i've been in love with it ever since because i'm an old nerd and when i see some [ __ ] like that and i think it's cool i never get over it jesus christ look at this [ __ ] frozen bananas you guys it's on was he i didn't know that was i didn't know that was with it but at the same time i was too you know hope you're still here if you're still here let me say something um that's what i was saying about the split the difference oh my god look at that melt you guys need to see the color this rosin is melting into uh [ __ ] dude i went in hot we went in just under 600 degrees holy [ __ ] you guys whoa hey what's up austin my homies in the northeast you know i love you i'm saying that a lot of them anyway that is a beautiful amount and if we were if you remember i was out of the right micron bag so i had to press that at 50. that's the 74 to 119 pressed in a 50 micron bag almost like the same size um you know not really but just a little bit so the fact that i knew that was going to be a little charry or maybe dark on the end as it did get a little char charlie when it dried up or finished but i cannot get over the color of that when it melted down was [ __ ] beautiful and it maintained its color for a minute tastes great tastes great it's a very interesting terpene profile um very very unique for me uh well you guys know it's got to be unique for me because every time i take a dab or a hit of anything i [ __ ] cough for 10 minutes and cry and that isn't happening so it must be different all right guys i was going to say have a great day but that dad was so [ __ ] delicious so delicious just like dog food tastes exactly like it smells delicious all right that's the low mic that's the that's the mids frozen bananas compared to this because this is way way way larger micron hash pressed out of a 50 micron bag so this is certain oh my god what do you guys think drop it i don't know sorry guys this [ __ ] is and i'd like to smoke something with some of my homies back home in missoula how is annie doing man thank you mom um reached out to me about um tincture help for either a sick person or a sick dog or i can't remember exactly but i wasn't able to find the uh micro encapsulation article i was looking for anyway uh it's been a while i'm glad you made it over so if anybody has the chance to try this strain frozen bananas this is my absolute first very very first experience with it [ __ ] uh don't get me wrong the guy that i the guy that i work with is an incredible brother absolutely incredible of the highest calorie so you know if you get your wheat from somebody that all the strains look the same don't be necessarily excited about frozen bananas it might not be that different this is very very exciting for me because it's so different than what i'm used to eddie peace 340. well that means it's 6 40 in california and almost 10 o'clock on the east coast cheers ladies and gentlemen that's exactly how you spell it with a k and one l oh my god wait you guys know i like that i like the flare for the dramatic but i tend not to exaggerate especially not when it comes to ash no cap definitely some of the best cash i have had hashtag that i've smoked so far this year period i don't care if it's from a hyperzone maker or if it's from the dispensary down the street this frozen banana ah find me um 120 to 159 the micron is dry ships hash rising is [ __ ] wild i cannot explain this taste to you guys i guess it is kind of mild like the way a banana is like a mild fruit but yo for real grizz that's what's up man austin where are you that's super cool yeah caspell's though also california's the only town county whatever it's the only place in montana that has a chick-fil-a so if you know what i'm talking about when i say there's nothing quite like the taste of [ __ ] hate oh you can only get it in council i got jokes open your heart let the hate out oh oh you guys i gotta lose some weight i gained weight during quarantine and then i just uh gained a little more love to michigan oh good luck with that because to be honest with you this is the problem the dab before this one i was supposed to quit and get and just finish what i need to do and be done but this [ __ ] is so good man so good nah anyway i hope you all have a wonderful week and hope you all have a wonderful weekend uh for those of you that are patrons or interested in becoming a patreon i'm sorry for those of you that are interested in patreon or are already patrons um i published uh one of the first of an eight video series um a couple days ago i've i have minutes maybe an hour left of editing for the uh part two part three is going to be wild it's going to be a celebration so far we're all only into hydrocarbon content but episode four if you can't tell from all these parchments around me is a dry sift and dry sift pressing episode so we got content coming go over and check it out if you like i and i say this because i encourage you those of you that are interested to just to go over and check it out it's you certainly you know pick the tier that you want with for whatever much you want to support me if you if you don't really give a [ __ ] about that and you just want to see what but what's up with the videos or if they're worth the money whatever then just do the small one you know either way you get to see with everything i just ask that anybody that has the ability and has any interest in helping to support me does that like mr david brazier has been like a [ __ ] high-level tear patron for a year and i mean i've while i think he's i think he's the longest that couple a couple of you guys have been rode with me and it's amazing but mr brazier from alaska i think he absolutely holds the record yes sir i'm gonna try i know this much up until um when i came to work today i had always had some hats you know what that or some oil or whatever but didn't really have any fire rotting feeling like my weekend's gonna be pretty sweet now let's get it started right cheers ladies and gentlemen after this i am gonna rock and roll and go ahead and finish my day pardon me i do encourage you to check out patreon if you're interested in processing a tutorial um hash tutorial but essentially processing tutorial content if you want to learn how to make some stuff make some high high quality stuff uh like there's there's a lot i number one i encourage you if you're gonna get into it to get a notebook my videos are you think my videos are long here the number two that's being published should be published tomorrow it's one right now i think i'm going to be able to knock down another couple minutes so if i should be able to get it to around one hour and 50 minutes it's just under two hours it's a [ __ ] movie i mean but it sucks and it's not entertaining however the amount of information in it is is probably pretty valuable um again check it out if you're interested if you're not i'm always here on youtube you can always email 710.consultations gmail.com you can always email the 7th extractions at gmail.com you're interested in booking a consultation and i'm actually i'm commenting from my 710 consultation so there it is 710.consultations gmail.com or you can text that number if you're interested in booking a conversation and for those of you that are interested in going over and checking out patreon that's great because i feel like i owe so much to the people that have supported me over the last year and the amount of content i i just fell short on being able to publish on time at all um i have this very very very comprehensive eight video series that i'm working on now and when it's finished it may be more like nine or ten videos but when it's finished i'm definitely going to turn off enrollment for a while um it's i uh it's hard when you finish a ton of content and then you need to get back to you know to work and or whatever you're doing and you have a new patreon patron or a subscriber or something come in and then you know their first question is when are you going to post something and i'm going like in my mind i'm thinking like i'm not even trying to shoot anything for a month so it's it's uh it's an interesting thing i'm not the kind of i'm not the kind of uh creator on patreon that like has a podcast going or anything that you would want you know that you check out regularly but there is a significant amount of information available to you right now and when i'm finished my a video series the amount of information that's available to you for the cheapest monthly subscription which is insanely cheap i think it's a pretty good deal i wish somebody would have put all that information together for me and been like give me a couple bucks and you can watch all these videos for a month all right guys yes you're absolutely right i didn't want so austin thank you um as far as things like if you might be interested in them like merchandise uh some personal time with me one-on-one stuff like if that's the kind of thing you're interested in there are some advantages to the opportunities but cheers ladies and gentlemen frozen bananas oh i'm under the same name i am everywhere brother however i do think it is all just one word i don't know why i spaced that either jesus that [ __ ] is so good i want to try a dab of it and save peace and kill the stream and that's my third day oh i love you guys but i gotta get back to it and get it wrapped up again i hope you have a wonderful weekend should anybody have any questions comments concerns anything feel free to go ahead and throw that in the comments section below and aside from that if you have any uh interest in a consultation inquiry you can email 710 dot consultations at gmail.com or you can text

well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful

[Music] you", "QAkbtBShyp0": "hey everyone how's it going Eric here with peer pressure we're gonna be showing you our top five tips and tricks for getting the most out of your flower rosin so whether you're pressing at home on a hair straightener or using an industry-leading press like our peg speak rosin press we've got all the tips and tricks so you can get the most out of it tip number one quality in quality out this is the most important thing that you should know when you're making flower rosin or any rosin the better the material you're starting with the better your results are going to be and the fresher it is the better the clarity as material tends to age it's gonna oxidize and you're gonna find that that rosin is gonna come out darker so if you're looking to make the best flower rods and you possibly can get stellar material and press it as soon after its dried and cured as possible tip number two relative humidity makes a huge difference with flower rosin now you can go check out our other video where we did the full in-depth test but what you need to know is that your flower should be at least at 55 to 62% humidity before you press it this makes a massive difference in your yield so just make sure that your material is properly hydrated before you press it tip number three choose your temperature based on your desired results so we encourage a lot of experimentation and you're gonna find that most people are either pressing on the lower temperature range which is about 160 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit or the higher temperature range which is anything from 190 to as high as 250 degrees so depending on what kind of consistency you want to achieve that's where you're gonna set your temperature on the lower range you're gonna be looking at more of a butter on the higher range more of an oil or a shatter so when you have some material that you're playing around with we encourage you to try both ends of the spectrum and see which one you like the most tip number 4 choose the right micron bag type now you can absolutely press flower outside of a bag and get great results but that's usually only a gram or two you're gonna want to press in a 90 or 115 micron bag or at the most 150 we recommend not going any lower than 90 because that's when you're gonna see a huge drop-off in yield so if you're pressing flour in a bag make sure to stick in that range and finally tip number five if you're looking to make the highest quality flour on possible you absolutely don't need to overdo it on the pressure now you can definitely over press your flour rosin by applying way too much force at your bag and in fact we've seen great results not only with yield but of course with quality pressing at the lower end of the pressure range anything from around 550 to 1600 psi at the bag so when you're applying way too much pressure in the many thousands what can often happen is that you're pushing out plant fats lipids you know the waxes as well as all of those undesirable plant materials into the rosin really over pressing it so if you're looking for the highest quality rosin we recommend trying the lower pressure range and seeing your results

know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably

I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "nigBtfIJcaQ": "hello rso sosa and today i ain't stopping people don't get me wrong it knocked me out at 5pm last night with that weed [Laughter] woke up today and i thought [ __ ] it let's get a reload so what we've got is in this one is this is what once is i think this is the white rants this one well that's the wheat ranch one of these is the white ones that's probably the wheat runs and it looks weird yeah that's gelato both look pointed are we in it well i'm confused now moody packaging then it sandwich bags i'm saying that's what it rants in there and that one is some gelato stuff i can't remember even that got a lot of i don't know something cool feel though the ginger balls on it yeah that's the gelato we won i don't know what the name of it is but it's gelato something or other but i'll let you know in the comment section five [ __ ] balls i run it all day strong whoa so then we come to whitehouse mcrunter snaps through our ass absolute gary glitter balls in this [ __ ] oh [ __ ] me bash it up looking forward to a drink to that so we've also got some pink sandy and animals so we get these animals out see what animals are saying let's see if we're getting to the bottom of the bag of all god's animals miss it by day and it all goes away isn't as potent as these two but obviously gelato comes with a heart hurt thing and white runs well you are right smells very nice though very very nice it's animals and then good old [ __ ] pink sandy's going your t-birds how are we doing pink sandy i want to just go you're the one you're the one one go on pink sandy the glitter balled up to the eyeballs a little definitely got smaller nugs than we did yesterday but like i said leave it a day it all flies away but we don't stop cherry pop fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs upon fireballs stop i couldn't stop couldn't start nearly bought half ounce of two different flavors at half our free [ __ ] i had yesterday and cosmic crisp or whatever the [ __ ] it was but that cosmic crisp weren't good enough to be buying a half ounce of and zr3 i thought you know what i've tried it i'm gonna go for four different flavors half ounce and then saves the pennies done it while you get to taste the rainbow so what we're going to do is we'll start with these animals from flavours no moody packets or whatever people go on about it but flavors is animals i'm going for this one first because i don't think this is going to be the best out of them i think it's going to be the worst to be honest with you so rather get it out of the way first of all see how we go mr malocco first type very smooth very nice very very nice it's got very clean sweet with it it tastes very very clean this dude very very clean not not overpowering with a turp profile so getting a little tingle not a bomb straight in the head but yeah you know you're smoking a bit of bang bang here it's animal very clean very very clean that's all i can really say about it it's very clean about seven out of ten on the kick starting to get that caddy bang bang swept with it now but overall clean smoke right the next one i believe guava latto guava latto i think this gelato gelato guava one of them as the videos going i'm sure by the time we get to the by the time we get to the description or the title we have the correct name down another lawyer please all the turp profile you could hit straight away soon as you ever talk through that is it be is it me straight away straight away that one there there's animals you toke it and it's it's clean it's nice it's power but just clean with this one with the gelato we're not i suppose it's coming with that gelato tur bit it's [ __ ] nice you know i mean it comes with the power with a nice gelato okay it's a very sweet lovely that's wow nice that is that's very very nice i don't know i missed the cross with the la wherever the lotto is but what happened i was it quite interesting wanted to see what this one actually is you could talk about that that would be happy very much taking the taste of sure but that's what i'm saying it's got very nice very nice profiles but very very nice smoke's very clean as well i would prefer this one over those animals because it's just got a bit more of a turp profile to it you know it's over i'm getting more higher because i've smoked the next joint and that's why i'll get you more stone don't know much you've just had some weed of the other one charming get your head straight you can't but the power to the face flex to the face rso is it's left a lovely turp profile on your mouth now after you've exiled you're left with a lingering scrumptious should i say not really wanted to put it down to be honest with got it's microphone ash have a bash i would tell that have a [ __ ] bash and if you don't want to ever take these off then we're going to go for white runts i've had this in a while believe i have had white rants before you know been a crocodile last time i had weight rants but at the menu on the second go round our four yeah come on then let's have some wheat ranch on it profile ain't as good as sharper very sharper this one that one's got some depth in the top profile this one comes have some of that very nice though very nice once again i don't know if it's just because it's the third joint but this joint's feeling look it's got more power tell you what though falling asleep at [ __ ] 5 r5 yesterday in the afternoon after all them bangers feel [ __ ] tested today fan [ __ ] tastic white runs if i wanted something where nowhere you want to sit there and get a nice taste on with it i would choose the guava latto if i wanted something nowhere you're feeling all fresh and just thinking so what [ __ ] it get moving just have a nice drink i'll go for the go for the white runs it seems like that that guava is more of an evening you know when you're in the evening you just want to [ __ ] really sit there and enjoy your banger guava i think would be nice for that the white ranch is more like daytime freshy i like it's deep but more moose pig sandy i've left this the last because i thought this is going to be the number one bang bang a real head high [ __ ] turpee profile fingers in a pie aye aye captain barrels eye do you know what i mean jelly bean pink sandy [ __ ] andy just comes with a whole swap to the side compared to these ones this is cut it be on the right side this did it's come in with a the brass bands just come in and start kicking off you know i mean they're playing now i don't know this because it's the fourth joint but see guava's coming at you with a turk profile which is very similar to [ __ ] gelato even if this is quite like i don't know let me just be july but it tastes like [ __ ] gelato but with a rump on it this pink sandy's coming at me with the same troop of strength from the profile of that but with a whole different type of profile more sweet more a step five distance this is how many blind side in yeah one bang to decide what didn't see that coming rough i mean left with bit pink sandy walking home i'd have done him if i knew that love that means he said you and sandy's walking home you've been sidewinded that's it [ __ ] over at it at least you and sandy will be all right though old stroke pig sadly i would smoke pig sadly out of these and then i'd go for the guava then the wheat rats and then there's animals peace out people", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "qFkHZkeSyZM": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well got milk rod art and vs. bar garden video once again you guys really enjoyed the first one and you guys know me man I'm [ __ ] I love raw garden man rock garden is like my top right now this brand rock garden is amazing but today I feel like we already reviewed this one the key lime honestly I to be honest with you guys to be honest with you guys I don't remember but this one thing oh [ __ ] gasps berries and cream and I'm kind of just sick try this one Oakland but you guys know man got the v-model got this the Ease battery out it's been a minute was good with the blinker you never had a blinker and this part has to be like my favorite shirt honestly but we got the key lime pie ladies and gentleman was good you know let's check it out ooh okay okay this one's looking nice and clear I want to compare some of the flavors because a lot of people say that this [ __ ] all just has the same taste and I'm like you know that I don't disagree with you but at the same time like there has to be like a little hint of flavor the gasps berries and cream I think this one's gonna be gasps so everybody always asked me how come I never hit blinkers and well you know what I got iron baby lungs and the reason why I keep myself the reason why I take such little hits and I don't hit blinkers and uh that's just because once I start hitting blinkers I've said it before my tolerance is gonna go up and then I'm out to start taking blinkers like all the time just to get kind of let you know and then just it's just not and that way you know every time I take little hits I'm always lit and I don't have to take off I hate to get lit you know I think this one is the guy's very soul oh [ __ ] okay I gotta restart that actually I'm ready to go oh this one oh this is a podcast I do not condone the usage of these products this is literally just an educational review you know just kick them back but all right I got you guys for shading this time shout out to the whole world shout out to everybody watching this video that what you guys wanted whoa I was only off by like two three seconds but I felt like that shows gonna blink and oh that one hurt gasps berries and cream at 81 percent THC the key line the key line is at a key lime is that 89 percent THC damn this was pretty much 90% maybe this is the one that I hit right now sheesh god damn yo I swear it let me know the comments down below if you guys are able to hit a legit raw garden blinker bro [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] is tough let's try the beam on Wow I can only imagine if I hit it on the B want dude I even hit that [ __ ] out of loli sensitivity - I got so Pete decide everybody the reason why alright so I don't really be smoking out crazy like how people think you know people think like I'm probably I'm probably stoned all day but now I'll probably only get lit you know when I'm recording a video or maybe like a nighttime you know when I'm doing my [ __ ] but I always had this like theory in my head where if I don't hit anything too hard or if I try not to get my turn it's like super super high up I'm gonna remain a lightweight when it comes to smoking but at the same time it's just like how do I see it like the amount of either like wax or like trees that I have to smoke to get lit is so little compared to like all my friends like I thought all my friends these guys are like everyone has like a really high tolerance and I feel like my tolerance is low just because you know I kind of take like controlled hits if that makes sense you know I'll tell I'll take enough for me to feel late if that makes sense I mean I'm still getting late I'm still taking [ __ ] hits you know but I don't be taking like big ass hits because that way you know my thoughts is just low and I'm getting late cuz I'll stop [ __ ] it bro oh my god I'm [ __ ] zooted right now whoo yeah yeah and I got you guys a in the next video get into the cartridge I'm gonna try another blinker you know until we finally got it for the video but hey you know I'm just trying to keep it real with you guys you know like [ __ ] that regarding who you know it's pretty little - I just recently just saw the 710 pods like I think that's literally gonna be like the next video I make right there just the 7/10 pause Allen ooh I didn't see it like til I was walking out the door like you know I was just walking I was just looking at the club I was just looking at the selection I was like on my way out what the [ __ ] I saw like you know the 7 10 11 spot it was like 75 bucks and I was like you know what this [ __ ] must be so far you know you know so especially with cartridges there anything else like I just be taking like the littlest baby hits I get it lit but it's just like my tolerance is just stays low you know so that's I wanted sometimes like like right now [ __ ] died right now holy [ __ ] let's shot both [ __ ] oh [ __ ] late I know you get that thumbnail going you know me yeah so stay tuned everybody for a seven-ten labs review cuz I'm for sure gonna cop to of those I don't first you're gonna do to 710 labs and one sitting [ __ ] am definitely gonna review those I'm gonna review a couple more studies to that keyline is just fired I think this is the key line hmm just like [ __ ] which is which vitas Aquila is the gas right here the gas berries and cream oh [ __ ] I heard both these flavors were like really popular but I can see why like gas berries and cream sad catchy name but the key line is just pretty much 90% THC almost all of them have like the same flavor would like a little extra policy look this one does look a little bit more yellowish than this one but they're both cleared I think I'm just tripping I'm [ __ ] tripping they're both the same color so this company and viral cleanse um hit me up right so they have like little like like mini AC filter machines where you can just put like you know connect it like for example you can put it in your living room you know your bathroom or like your bedroom for example for me I'm gonna put in my bedroom and you just connect it and you just like powered it up you power it up and it kind of just filters like everything you know it's either smaller if it's like an at your room just kind of smells like a nasty room that doesn't get opened you know like the what you guys don't open the windows I'm not saying you guys though but I'm saying you know there's people out there that don't open windows keep the doors closed and you know eventually the smell I starts to get kind of nasty so this machine right here right it's like a foot it's an air it's an air filter so once you turn it on it's like it starts it's suck it starts to suck I like especially if you're burning too if you're smoking you could literally like [ __ ] have them like you could have like a smoke get sucked in and just everything like you know your entire room is just [ __ ] filtered so I was just thinking I was like BAM and I've seen this [ __ ] on YouTube I've seen other youtubers have this um this air filter right there just smoking a joint whatever you know they have that [ __ ] on and I'm like bro once I get that [ __ ] I might have the role of enjoy I might have to test it out oh damn because if I dab it in my room just a little bit of it like the smell leaks a little bit just a little bit but I'm just like doing if I have this little [ __ ] this AC air filter machine chilling you know in my room and I'm smoking a joint I'm like Bravo see you know I'm just going back and forth with the company right and pretty much [Music] anyways I just like also what would you think about um doing with what the product right and I'm like you know what I'm just gonna do that I'm gonna smoke one of my products inside my house inside my room and I'm gonna just turn on the AC and I'm gonna make a video like a little vlog and we just smoke in the joint and seeing how good you know it sucks the air in and like the smoke and then you know my just wait then I'm gonna go out I'm a glob Tom my fam like a like does it stink or anything like that you know but it's not gonna stink because I know that [ __ ] I seen that machine it's really [ __ ] high quality it's like oh it's like almost like eight hundred dollars and I'm like damn they're hooking it up with one so well could stay tuned you guys cuz [ __ ] that be sick I'll be able to just smoke a little joint in here dad that's like that's okay and

welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review but first

wedding cake i have reviewed a few a few strains for them in the past i want to say the garlic grove and the gmo cherries they were very good if you haven't seen those reviews go ahead and go check them out but today we got the wedding cake and this is coming to you at a 29 on the thc and a one percent on the cbd looks very good and like always if you guys want to see an up close picture of the bud check it out [Music] as you can see there it looks really good it smells really good too 29 on the thc one percent on the cbd it is going to run you 36.08 at blue fire dispensary in merced california and this is an indica dominant hybrid and i did a little information on or i looked up some information online and it says that it's a cross of girl scout cookies and cherry pie i don't know if that's correct or not so if it's not don't [ __ ] come at me in the comment section because i just [ __ ] look it up online so cheers everybody let's take a hit of this wedding cake by next green wave okay first initial thought great flavor tastes really good i did buy the slurry cane to review today as well i'll be reviewing that uh shortly so stay tuned for this hurricane review but this wedding cake it tastes really good it does give you that long expansion that i'm looking for in a indica the smoothness was there it wasn't harsh at all but like always two for the review today next green wave had a uh little promotional thing promo thing at blue fire the first 50 people there got a t-shirt and a little swag bag which had a grinder in it it says next green wave uh their lanyard which i'm wearing here a dab mat and oh a cool little little bag too the shirts here behind me they only had a large so they had to give me a large i am a medium but after washing it and drying it it might shrink enough for me to wear it on a review if not next green wave you guys are gonna have to hook me up with a t-shirt that fits so i can wear it on my reviews for you guys okay i got the second one packed up i do like it so far it it's not like a crazy heavy hitter that's gonna put you on put you on your ass on one hit it is a smooth smoke um but two for the review cheers hope everybody's having a great day not too hungover from halloween oh [ __ ] solid oh next green wave also started doing cartridges i got a few carts uh i got the sluricane and the gmo cherries and these are sauce carts the the the owner of next greenway was actually there and talked to me for a little bit and gave me some info on these i'll tell you guys when i review them oh [ __ ] i want to give a quick little shout out to to some of the some of the bud tenders that have helped me out over the over my visits at blue fire so let's see shout out to melissa c uh lisa h felix v melissa j raquel m and john d i know there's a lot more but those are just a couple of the receipts i had laying around blue fire they're uh their bud tenders are always really cool with me and [ __ ] so i just wanted to give them a quick shout out i know some of them watch the channel okay i got both hits in let's calculate it up okay price and blue fire dispensary where i got this it was 36 out the door it's a great [ __ ] price can't beat it the look and the smell is is really good it's you know it's it's great it looks really good the flavor of this weed is great it tastes really good i can't say anything negative about it don't have no grassy aftertaste solid a lot of flavor in this wheat the smoothness is there it's not harsh at all and the high the high is really good i could probably take another bong hit you know to put me over the top where i need to be but i'm stoned i can see myself smoking a blonde of this or a nice joint a couple wrong heads it's a good strain so overall for the wedding cake my next green wave i'm gonna give it the 8.2 it's a solid strain it's nothing crazy over the top but it's a really good strain i recommend trying it out it's the 8.2 um nothing negative to say about it it could you know i'm just a heavy hitter i need those i've been smoking for so long i need those crazy heavy hitters to get me up into the 8.9 or the nines and [ __ ] so 8.2 that's a really good score highly recommend it if you guys haven't tried next green wave you should uh that was my review until next time smoking a small town [Music]", "j-FFcCKEEi8": "what's going on guys it's your boy sam from sammy cbd tv welcome back welcome back to everybody uh you know let's get you popping right like old times right all right guys today i got a review coming at you with the white cbg from a company known as nothing other than the main company called the diet dank cbg white white cbg diet dank guys this company i was introduced to uh by green point c company it's an absolute it is like an astonishing company um green point seed company i highly recommend them for any of you cultivators out there all right so why don't i just give you i'm gonna give you a little bit of a bust down i'm gonna i always like to i like to see what the company says in their description just so you guys know what they're bringing to the table okay so let's check it out white cbg hemp flower is an incredible popular among the hemp consumers the dense buds boasts an attractive ray of colors beneath the white trichome blanket a lot of you guys know cbg has got that white look to it um and it's always a little drier i've noticed out of all the strains in the past that i've ever smoked or vaped um this is an indica dominant strain guys so let me get right back into it all right so notably white cbg contains extremely low thc levels while maintaining a potent cannabinoid profile in fact white cbg contains up to 20 cbg and has thc percentages well below 0.3 hemp threshold as such consuming this indica dominant health cultivator will not cause anyone to feel high though it may make them feel a whole lot better anyway so cbg is one of over 100 cannabinoids guys um you guys know one of my favorite cannabinoids is cbn okay cbg is an especially exciting cannabinoid because it's the precursor to all the other cannabis based cannabinoids um it is the first cannabinoid to develop in the residence trichomes of the hemp flower okay so it usually transforms into other cannabinoids like thc then cbd throughout a process called cannabidrolic acid synthesis okay so you'll find perfect balance of cbg in white cbg they're claiming strains such as these have exceptionally high cbd levels because growers can allow them to develop cannabinoids while into the season without risking much thc development so they're saying it's skunky creamy pine aromas okay so it's an indica dominant hemp variety that features dense colorful buds coated in milky white trichomes mild odors producing a faint hint of fresh earth pine lemon and cilantro its most dominant terpenes include migraine pinene carotene and visible oh notably this unique profile combines nicely to create a relaxed while clear-headed experience just what i like to see and just what i like to hear right guys um indoor ground so it's exceptionally smooth causing a slight heat in the back of the throat a strong citrus flavor [Music] consume an after dessert or pleasant compliment to an early cup of joe despite its missing psychiatric properties consumers often find themselves feeling relaxed and better focused clutter-free mine that's what's up i have to uh no all jokes aside but guys we're gonna see what this is all about i'm actually kind of interested now that they're uh you know saying all these things about it all right guys so let's check it out let me bring this little closer to you one second one second boom check that out you like how that's that focus game i don't see anybody else's cameras on youtube looking like that boy all right i'm happy to be back you know i miss you guys much love much love we got some great reviews coming up front guys i've had this um five leaf wellness uh barry cross sitting in my like bedroom for like almost a week now i will get to it i'm sorry that'll be next i promised this one like a long time ago so i'm just trying to go in order again right so i'm getting that cilantro hempy it actually smells pretty pretty good all right not bad let's check it out guys that's the um that's not bad wow there's definitely a lot of trichomes on there wow yeah that's that's definitely got some trichomes on there you can't really tell first until you get it close and light let me uh let me just i'm gonna break it open a little bit oh wow i find it smelling like cilantro and grass but it's got this really nice hint of something in there guys it's like deep in there i'm getting that i think it's the citrus hold on man it does have citrus guys you gotta like really break it open though to really get it like i'm not gonna front like it's not strong but when you get it it's there oh man this [ __ ] smells so good all right so naturally it breaks down like with no effort i mean it's it's on the drier side i've had this for a while though too so you know look at that look at that look at that piece hanging on my nose but you know for real this [ __ ] was like you know it's a little dry but uh like i said i've had it for a little while now so guys i'm gonna be vaping this bad boy today because i want to know what it's all about as far as clean hit all right guys i'm going to be using the uh get high as an hi this is my get high vaporizer it's got the uh joint right there so one two 3 4 5. all right so as you can see the uh the green see it it's actually heating up currently right now yo when you guys get a moment because i had to listen to uncopyrighted music for my uh video because all like it's crazy because people are just heated up so i can't talk anymore all right guys let's see what it's all about cbg man cbg [Music] make it it's got like a really smooth wow i'm starting to feel now it's like it's right here it has that citrus taste guys it's got that real green like i'm talking like green green that's not bad i'm just gonna do that one that's that one ball pack this for this round because this [ __ ] is it's pretty official i could feel it already it's just creeping in there like real calming now not like super crazy or nothing as far as like making me anxious and [ __ ] yo some strains though y'all [ __ ] that i'm just gonna be honest crazy you know what i mean like i wouldn't even mess with them i wouldn't even mess with them man that is that's not bad though that's really not bad guys i might just kind of i kind of think this is pretty good white cbg dieting keep out of the reach of children consult your health care oh wow am i pregnant or nursing nope that's not bad guys so like i said this is a indica dominant [Music] strain huh we have other cbg strains too wow let me check that out i actually didn't even know that oh excuse me guys thank you alright huh wow guys i just i well now okay honestly i feel super calm right now like actually it's kind of it's quite a little it's quite pleasant i thought it would make me anxious truthfully but i'm gonna check this let me just dial in here see what we got we'll see it says within average resting range so you know i'm not getting the heart racing guys it's not making me very anxious maybe a tad anxious but most of it's in my head because a lot of you guys know i took a break from doing reviews so this is pretty cool listen to this guy so inactive in its acidic form cannabinoids like cbga become decarboxylated when heated altering their chemical structure most of you guys know that when you're making edibles you need to decarboxylate the flower first before you do it that way it's activated okay so cbda turns into cbd thca turns into thc okay so non-acidic cbg really binds to both cb1 and cb2 receptors throughout the body and may help regulate endocannabinoid signaling though cbg is not psychoactive it may help regulate the levels and reduce thc high that accompanies marijuana consumption uh it's a quick solution to marijuana over indulgence so apparently they're claiming that if you have too much thc you can use the cb g oh i really didn't know i didn't actually some of the stuff i didn't know about cbg like i said you guys know i'm ultra familiar with cbd thc et cetera cbn as well but cbg i wasn't 100 sure i did a review in the past about it but excuse me wow that is what the strains doing to me i feel like licking my eyes i feel like this super like calm dude i'm not gonna lie guys i was very very nervous okay i'm just gonna turn that music off because i want to be 100 real with you guys i was so freaking nervous to do review because my last experience with that cbd hemp flower i got the skywalker strain from plain jane and it just sent me into a full-blown panic attack um the one before that that set the tipping point like basically once i had this one strain from there on out panic attacks all the time a lot of you guys and i know a lot of you guys can uh you know that what's the word for that relate you can relate to what i'm saying because you know you know um so basically secret nature's secret dream strain sent me into a full-blown massive panic attack it is a sativa strain i freaked i mean i literally walked inside ripped my shirt off i went up to my girl said yo i think i'm gonna have a heart attack i think i'm dying um i was so so scared guys and you know what it makes me want to tear up because i'm being for real like you can't make that [ __ ] up and a lot of you guys are like [ __ ] or uh cbd's diet weed it's like first of all i'm gonna tell you right now that secret dream strain that i got through either it was the terpene profile or they definitely pushed through some stuff that was above the legal limit whatever okay i used to be a full-blown marijuana advocate i used to love thc and all that guys i can't use the anymore um only for the simple fact that it caused me to have psychosis um i got some synthetic k2 stuff guys if you don't know um it sent me to a full-blown psychosis state from there on out i couldn't smoke cigarettes i couldn't walk fast i couldn't do anything to elevate my heart rate it made me always think i was having a heart attack um when i used that k2 spice guys my heart rate went up to 196. okay that is terrifying okay terrifying so you know from there on out i couldn't do that and uh you know that secret dream strain really woke something up my mind from like that moment from years ago because i was i was panicking all the time guys like all the time you know so whatever it was i'm not gonna lie it made me freaking nervous um but anyway so basically i got the skywalker strain then from plain jane and it did the same thing um why did it do that i don't know so i just wanted you guys to know that if you guys are thc sensitive individuals okay like i had become later on in life um really check the thc a um in most strings okay a lot of people like the cbc along with the cbg and i got the delta eight vape cards and the delta eight this and that if you have a sensitivity to th e do not use delta eight at all okay common sense don't do it you're gonna freak the [ __ ] out you don't want to do that to yourself okay if you're sensitive to i can't say cbd because no one's really sensitive to cbd however well they're sorry man this this strain makes me tired so all those strains literally have thc in them okay the legal limit hence the legal limit so even though it's cbd hemp flour there's still some thc in it so if you are really that sensitive to thc like you like i am you really guys need to be careful for real i do not want to see anybody freak the [ __ ] out kill themselves jump in front of a bus because you're going through that crazy panic phase where you literally think you're really dying okay um i'm here for you guys if you ever need a friend to talk to comment down below all you guys know me i give away as much as i can in fact i'm having a two ounce giveaway coming up i'm gonna give two ounces to one individual okay two freaking ounces okay i might even do that not tomorrow but the next day okay i'm gonna give away two ounces to someone that really is in need okay um but anyway because i'm mumbling now to go back to what i was saying is you really got to be careful about the the tolerance problem okay guys um i don't want to see anybody freak out like for real so if that's the case i'd recommend the cbg because i didn't know that cg actually can bring down the thc high it's kind of interesting actually in fact i'm going to look more into cooler uh more other indica cbg strings because i really like this they use one freaking ball pack dude and it's got me going like a mug like i'm gonna show you another i'm gonna give you another picture of this little tiny this nug and how it looks okay so check that out you see that look at that you can see the frost look at this like frost balls protruding from it it's kind of insane wow this is dry see that you see it turned to dust that's interesting anyways guys it's your boy sam thanks for tuning in for another

another cart this time my special glow extracts they did their first special cart with the Black Mamba 24 and now they're back with a wafers glow extracts they also released a watermelon og which had watermelon designs and another wafers flavor and the sour patch kids which I will be getting my hands on and definitely reviewing but just the packaging just started off I love this the waffle cone design the pink in pink in tan I love that bottom glow top wafers let's look at some of the changes they made recently as you can see now at the bottom says glow extracts I got this before and I was kind of confused I thought it was a fake for a moment but they have changed this officially since then and I am so glad they did this when I when I saw this on their Instagram or on their on their snapchat story I was hype real see cell as always claw has been some of the most consistent carts really out there really the only carts you can know for sure that they are real their Instagram is right there they also have a website where they post all of their lab results if you have to don't want to go see them love this packaging now over to the cart this I noticed I'm not sure if this is just a mistake or on purpose but this this cart seems to be a bit darker than normal not sure if they use different kind of terpenes or something but this is a wafers cart of course which is you know like vanilla wafers in this and it tastes this is definitely not a fruit if for if you love fruity carts this is not for use is it taste savory it tastes a little syrupy it it does represent wafers well and you should definitely try one of these get my fingerprints all over it but they always knock it out of the park with their collaborations and really any any other flavors are really true to the actual flavor even with their normal flavors so definitely check glow extracts out if you have never tried one of their carts you're missing out to be honest check out the channel for other videos I got videos tons of videos just like this and yeah later", "Ux1I3kIqspQ": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I'm gonna be talking about this kind of restrain in front of me this is skittles with a Z at the start and at the ends and we're gonna talk about it in a bit of detail right here on the ice smoker Channel let's talk about the background of the skills cannabis train this is a really popular one for gem family and Terk hogs all involved with the creation of this strain it combines Grape Ape with grapefruit to mix those flavor profiles and it really does deliver a unique strong delicious sweet and fruity flavor the tagline for skittles is taste the rainbow and you get that with a flavor of the skills bud but also with the appearance as it's growing if it gets cold just before flowering it develops these nice purples it's just super popular from what I can see looking online doesn't it like you can get the seeds or the feminized seeds so clone only virgin family gifting Terp hogs one of the cuts of skills and the legend was born all right so I know there's gonna be a lot of searches for skittle so this is probably going to be quite a popular strain review I'll refer you to my research sources in the description in a video but it's places like wiki leave seed finder and several other sources just to try and get a background of this strain this particular batch of the skittles is some of the best I've come across this is organically grown in living soil using the no-till method of growing big up to Roadrunner really really nice skills this and I'm looking forward to covering it in more detail let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain so we've got the skit was here let's ever look at it I like the brand in I like that skittles sticker there taste the strain bro opening up the glass jar to look at the skills contained within yeah well not as many colors on the but as I was expecting actually I've got our flower from this grower that has plenty of purples and plenty of different colors on the bud this is more of a single green color right it's got the green sort of loosely stacked calyx a lighter color Asian dusty Huai comes the pistols are visible for troodon from flower as well let's get another nug out and just to see what the rest of them are looking like what singular colors you know so when I was reading about it was talking about how it it's got all these different colors but I would say that that isn't showing in this bit of flower nice trim job the buds been presented well I'm impressed with a look I wouldn't say it's as complex looking as some of the other strains I wouldn't say that it is jumping out at me as wowza this deserves its complete reputation based on look a low but well presented organically grown sort of buds got their own unique structure and shape it looks good but how does it smell I like to open a jar and just get a whiff of that gr smell and this is where the true skittles flavor really starts to come through the aroma is so identifiably skittles that you can just tell as soon as that hit my nostrils and that is what gives it its distinguished ability amongst the other leading strains out there you can smell it and know what you're smelling where is love a stranger might be like oh it could be this could be this this is skittles and you're gonna know their skills when you smell it what does that smell Intel it is a mixed sweet fruitiness that combines the grapefruit and the grape together it kind of comes across like a sweet sour citrus kind of combo which starts in the aroma as like a bag of sweets but then as you inhale deeply you start to get the citrus notes like creeping in it's a real pleasure to to smell this one so really really nice smell guys ten out of ten in terms of the smell I've smelt a fair bit of Skittles this is some of the nicest smelling skills that I've tried I could literally just stand like this for an hour just smelling this and just enjoying the sensation wowza one hour later excellent excellent expression of the skills of Roma in this grow we're gonna break this up and just see what smells are released inside here we go Oh exactly the same but with a wolf that comes from pungency that wasn't as available before so you're still getting the sweet you're still getting a mixture of those fruity flavors it's got an American smell like a Cali inspired sort of smell to it but it's very kind of natural and pungent that kind of skunk enos just coming through right at the end as you do a deep inhalation let's move on to the taste section of the review I've got my bong here we're gonna smoke some bombs of the skittles and see how it treats us I should also get a vaporizer we rounding up some of this skills to enjoy I have been smoking this really a while so I've tried it in every consumption method I really like it through the bong I really like it in a joint as well it's a nice smoking to join the skills this section of the video is all about that flavor if you are joining me for this one get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs really de briques heated up we're about to smoke and vape some of the skills cannabis strain but my vaporizers are heating up so that is going to give us a brilliant idea of that vaping flavor in the meantime let's smoke our bowl of the skills and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] I was so smooth and light I didn't even do the ball [Music] Wow what did come through was that it was flavor and actually I reckon it is down to the method of growing that organic no-till method of growing delivers such a nice smooth smoke and a strong flavor profile and this is one of the nicest sort of no-till grows that I think I've tried to they really enjoyed that flavor no need to cough no sort of acridity by in the chest just tasted them really really nice we're gonna do another one in a minute first of all we're gonna try the mighty vaporizer let's get an idea of how it bakes really skills e on the exhale or still now like the roof of my tongue is getting this skills flavor coming through like super strong super super strong [Music] that is in my top five will vapor straight away straight away Wow again I've got shout out the no-till method of growing Wow's our paint so top marks for flavor as well let's talk about the effects of the skills skittles is an indica dominant strain it's a hybrid obviously you've got a sativa of the grapefruit in there as well but it's listed as an indica dominant strain it doesn't mean it just sits you down and relaxes you straight away now first it brings you up and you get an almost sort of creative Drive something you could literally clean the house with but this doesn't last a long time if you don't catch it and start being active in those first few minutes as you start to experience the higher then the next stage settles in and it will take away that drive because it is a relaxation it's a heaviness it's a suit ly to that afternoon and even in tire smoke and it's something that actually for me is very very strong but also makes you feel a little bit chatty and a little bit sort of lifted as well how am I feeling right now it's time to kick in nice and fast I mean the vapors got a really high absorption rate clocks in between 15 and 23 percent THC there's not as strong of those super strong ones but I said it isn't everything sometimes it's the mixture the cannabinoids the terpenoids the flavonoids everything feels really really strong despite it sitting around the sort of 20 ish percent mark and yeah on the indica side but feel nice in the mind as where you know is that the hybrids do they combine the good effects on both ends of the spectrum I can feel the waves kicking in I've only had one bong and a vape of it and it is in odd I can feel a lot of tightness in my like around my eyes I kind of like headband but more around my eyes let's sum things up today I've been enjoying the skills cannabis Train organic no-till big up road run up we're about to smoke another bong of it right here on a channel join me for this one and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] taste me it really comes fruit and I'm really late the flavor of that appearance-wise it looks nice maybe didn't bring out the Purple's because the stable temperature is a nice looking bit flower smell wise fantastic 10 out of 10 it's a really really nice smell it's like sweet notes there's like sour notes you know it's really complex flavor-wise the smell carries right through into the flavor vaping it is absolutely fantastic smoking it tastes great as well when it's a really smooth smoking experience I put a lot of that down to how well this particular batch has been grown and effects wise it's a lovely heavy stone for that afternoon even in time something that I will be

yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another cartridge uh this time another glow um i've done a bunch of these before but i like to do kind of an update anytime they get new packaging or new flavors or anything like that and uh this time we we have both new packaging well the packaging is very similar to how it used to be but instead of the gold shininess it's the rainbow speckled shininess so you know huge update in that department uh you can pause that there if you'd like to read any of that but this is the martian muffins flavor and they released probably like 10 to 15 new flavors not too long ago um and i am honestly a huge fan you can see i've been chiefing on this one a bit um this is an indica one uh 1.0 g cannabis oil one milliliter cartridge if you've never heard of glow extracts uh they're i guess black market company as in they don't they're not sold in dispensaries but they are definitely one of the uh most well-known out of any of them and they're obviously doing something they're obviously doing all right because they've been pushing out a lot of new flavors um i reviewed the they did the sour patch kids and the um the vanilla wafers and what was the other one oh they did the watermelon one and the the kobe one so they're doing something and they they do their best to eliminate fakes well fakes fakes of this company i guess they recently added um they have cards in every single box that shows what flavors are in there and they they're constantly changing their packaging changing it up a little bit just to make it a lot more difficult for any fakes to be manufactured their instagram right there glow extracts they also have a snapchat but um yeah this martian muffin one is delicious i love it it's it does have it has a little bit of fruitiness but it's mostly just like it reminds me of a lot a lot of the um the wafers not the vanilla wafers the other one where it's it's very uh like sweet but not in a candy way in like a in like a muffin way you know what i mean but i'm definitely a big fan of this flavor probably my favorite or second favorite glow card i've tried so far the gushers is delicious i love the gushers um but this is definitely a close second let's take the card out here if you have never tried glow extracts definitely a cheap alternative to a dispensary cart on the bottom there the cali logo glow extracts got rubber tips and rubber bottoms i've and i've never really had any like issues with these carts like leaking or anything like that so they're very consistent that's my you know that's what i like most about this company um so yeah definitely check it out um i got a bunch i got so many videos like this on my channel i also have a gaming channel which i will link in the description uh but uh yeah that's pretty much it guys i hope you enjoy i everyone's staying safe out there staying inside hopefully if you're able to and uh yeah later", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "M2nrzf7SWZw": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another glow extracts this time sour patch kids um this came out with their other special flavors like the watermelon og and the wafers both flavors of the wafers that came out um this is the one i was most excited for just because sour patch kids is probably one of my favorite candies like ever so i was very excited you can pause that right there if you'd like to read any of that let's pop this bad boy open because there's one other new uh addition to glow carts i don't know if i talked about it in my last video but right there that is their new uh it's kind of their new thing they got going on down at the bottom but for the flavor itself i i enjoy it very thoroughly it's like their classic um sweet you know sweet glow uh flavor but the aftertaste actually does taste like sour patch kids which i think is pretty crazy that they pulled that off uh i've been hitting this a little bit taking at least a nice say 10 to 20 rips out of it got some nice bubbles forming you can see by the way that bubble moves how slow or how thick the uh you know liquid is it's barely moving i would 100 recommend this cart especially if you're a fan of sour patch kids themselves this is a sativa i believe the wafers was a hybrid i think but this company has been doing some crazy stuff this is their instagram if you're interested um they've been doing a lot of great stuff a lot of great flavors they've been dropping new things they have lab results on all of their flavors on their websites they're on their website they have you know everything they also have they also have pre-rules and i believe they have bud but i have never tried either of those i've just been a fan of their carts for like over a year now so go check them out make sure they're real if you grab a box of them there will be a verification but if you're just grabbing singles there's no verification unfortunately but try to try to you know ask ask ask your dude be like yo you got the box on you by chance then just scan it on them if there's no thing to be scratched off and to be scanned they're fake and be careful of those if you add their uh snapchat glows uh they'll be they post like all the the fake the scammers and all that and how to know if it's official or not so thank you guys for watching check out my channel for other videos and yeah peace out", "r5upzEPHSqI": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another dab pen and we're actually looking at another glow extracts before we get started I believe it's over 80 or 90% of you that watched this video are not subscribed so if you like what you see consider subscribing it's a whole lot of videos like this but anyway this is cereal milk this is from depending on when you're watching this this is either from their newest patch or their second newest patch they are about to drop a new set of flavors one of them being the Kobe the Black Mamba 24 flavor which I am definitely going to be able to get my hands on so that I will be releasing that as soon as I get it to be honest but if that has came out by now then this is their second newest set with the cereal milk you'll know from the red sticker box from the you know this design on it the holographic type design but I've been really enjoying new flavors so far and especially this one this is like kind of reminds me of there was those cereal bars like the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal bars you would get in like middle school or like high school it has that like milky flavor but I think it's if you if you're tired of a lot of the you know fruitier flavors like me this is definitely a great choice or if you're tired of a lot of the if you just want something sweet and almost like almost savory almost you know I've definitely been enjoying this so far and as you know you know gloves not always known for their slowest moving distillate but it has always been fire it's not like it's like liquid like straight just you know flowing liquid it's just just a little faster than some other carts but ain't nothing wrong with that it's always gas but I would definitely grab these make sure they're official they will have their there they're verified vendors on their interests are on their snapchat and this is their Instagram make sure you follow it there's a lot of fake accounts there's a lot of you know accounts getting taken down it's crazy crazy time in the weird world you know just be careful be careful ingesting be careful what you're following be careful who you who you're doing business with just be careful didn't drop a sub thank you guys so much for watching definitely grab one of these and goodbye", "4H-mtUZ_sbA": "hey guys what is going on today we're looking at another cartridge this time we're looking at space candy by Glo extracts oh this company has been doing pretty good lately like I know recently they announced they're gonna be releasing edibles and pre-rolls so if I can get my hands on those I'll definitely grab one and review it but this is a great company one thing I do like is every box has a QR code to scan so it's you know guaranteed to know if they're real or not don't leave any of that if you're interested but this space candy I'm big these carts have such a like a wide range of flavors like like I know some companies it's like they have a lot of flavors but they all kind of just taste the same this this one the flavor profiles are just crazy like this one space candy it definitely tastes like it tastes like some sort of candy I can't quite you know know what it is I can't figure it out but it tastes exactly like candy it's also like potent it's not just some filler flavor that they're adding like it seems like they actually know what they're doing can take a look at the cart you do the bottom believe it oh no it's just to see so that's good you know you wanna make sure it has that the main way to know if you're getting fake ones or not is that QR code and if you're not getting if there's no QR code on the box not a good sign man you should definitely find some other source but also on these they all have different stats and this isn't all of them there's like creativity there's a bunch of different ones on each different cartridge but any any of them that I've tried so far were very flavorful very potent I'm a big fan they're definitely doing big things soon you can tell they're growing nicely if you see one of these definitely pick one up if you like videos like this once the other cards check out my channel", "aCZwSW-rOos": "hey guys what is going on today bit of a special video for you guys this is a glow extracts car as you may probably know but it is not your average collector x-cart if you noticed the purple right there and the purple there this is the black mamba 24 cart the cart that they released for Kobe's death and in every master box that they have which is a hundred carts there's I believe only two of these so it's a pretty pretty rare cart also this is the first batch of their new packaging they make it very clear that they change their packaging a lot to avoid fakes so make sure you follow them if you want to keep up to date with what the new packaging is like this one as you can see got gold it has black like triangles and like kite shapes and a gold like you know film over it it's on the back too and I believe these stickers are new I don't think these they had these stickers before so you can pause that if you want to read it but yeah the black mamba 24 they announced this I mean few days after Kobe's death I believe I love what I think this packaging looks so good I love the purple in the yellow there and do too much purple just a little bit just to make it different enough it's an indica obviously I've tried this flavor I just wanted to repackage it for you guys one thing I wish I wish they made this little yellow part purple just you know to maximize the specialness of it I've hit this cart already obviously just to get the flavor and I gotta say I'm a very big fan of the flavor like I said I'm they didn't overdo it or anything like that which I'm very glad of they made it a very simple weed flavor like I think it tastes like kind of the original Ike the way way back like a few years ago the original TKO sour tangerines I don't know why it just has that flavor to it which I like I like the more you know bud tasting carts as you can see the bubble moves at a decent speed always with glow it's not the thickest oil but I think it is very high quality I would definitely grab this honestly if you get one of these I'd I'd keep it for a while just as like a collector's item or something cuz there are not very many made I can't why don't just focus bright well there we go but you can see from there usually the smaller bubbles move a lot slower than the bigger ones but if you see one of these I'd definitely grab it a great flavor a great way to commemorate Kobe's death black mama 24 very glad they did this I think the packaging is so nice like I think it looks great but yeah and other new flavors like mochi and all that the other new flavors should have this new packaging tube obviously not the purple so keep an eye out for that make sure you're smoking real products follow them on follow glow on snapchat or Instagram just so you can stay up to date so you know you're not smoking no [ __ ] pesticides but other than that", "IMcTc8LHrDM": "[Music] an example of an extremely happy and successful mixed marriage [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video but before i start this video i wanted to mention that this is a little shameless self plug i don't really plug my merch often in my videos but i figured you know some people have been asking me like when are you gonna drop a deal on your merch you know your merch is sick which i am grateful that you guys think my merch is sick because i i've done all the designs myself except for a few of them and uh yeah so if you actually like the designs it makes me feel a lot better about the designs i'm actually pushing out and uh i don't know this is one of them i also do have three designs that i recently did this week myself i think they're pretty good i'll post them on the screen right now but yes enough of that some of you have been asking if will i ever do a deal and i figure you know this whole month of november or whenever month i upload this because you know my videos are kind of like two weeks behind i will give a 25 off on my merch that's about shipping shipping costs and a little bit more you know i'm saying so if you guys do [ __ ] with the merchandise i appreciate it if you do buy some and you know if you don't like it i don't want you to buy it you know what i'm saying it's only for the people that really enjoy or enjoy or like the designs so enough of this let's get back to it so the title of video this sauce cart was 27 as you can see it is that next green wave and i've heard good things i looked on the website i've seen some stuff this is all sauce according to their instagram they also do have some fire flower so that's good as you can see premium 100 sauce cartridge you see right here everything when i first saw it at phenos uh it was uh showing this side so i was like what the [ __ ] some cheap ass [ __ ] but this side with all the branding on stuff it's very simple very you know very very uh you know i don't know it looks nice it just looks clean you know the font and everything but also the qr code all that stuff good positive from going too fast so so let's let's open this might be a tough one i gotta use a nail clipper i'm excited but then again 27 yeah we'll see we'll see if it's up there but right off the bat i mean what is this over here says use with 3.0 to 3.5 voltages prime cartridge by heating it so it's pretty light from what i i'm seeing right here and there is bubbles in there if you can't see that that's pretty crazy i didn't see like little small bubbles usually it's just one big air bubble um they're using the c cell similar to that of select or buddies so it's a little bit familiar so let's just take off this moxie one let's see what this uh how this packs punch this is the sauce card guys running at about eighty one percent total thc this is great pie cookies by the way i'm not sure if i mentioned the stream cheers no i'm just kidding but damn i'm definitely gonna buy more 27 out the door for this i kind of don't want anyone to upload this video because when i upload this video all you guys gonna know no i'm just kidding but yeah um wow very um i don't know i really enjoyed it it kind of tastes like cannabis derived terpenes with distillate though not gonna lie cheers not bad so they do say it's 100 sauce in this i mean it says right here but i don't know this taste is it kind of tastes like the what i just said the cannabis thrive terpenes but then it has like its own i'm gonna take like two more hits cheers boys whoo very much enjoyable um i don't know the lightness of it is kind of throwing me off i kind of and you kind of can see like a darkness on top of it that must be the terps on the top but yes nonetheless a very good buy for 27 dollars you know so cheers peace out guys [Music] thank you", "Kqkl_obhg-M": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys

"FqM0wYXvnqQ": "what is going on today we're looking at another cart this time UFO extracts I believe yeah UFO extra extract I haven't really seen these carts before recently like I've seen them on Instagram and stuff but this is a forbidden fruit flavor if you've had these before or if you you've had these and they look different or something just just let me know in the comments it's it's fun to respond to you know opinions and stuff on there but just to start I really love the packaging like the colors it's a very nice on the back it just says you know lab tested free of any contaminants it's interesting UFO extracts official actually the the shape of the cart I've never really seen before it's kind of interesting I think I don't know I don't know if you'll be able to notice but I don't know it's just kind of like a black and milds almost but um these carts I like them that the flavors are nice it gives it just has that uh you know that that trademark like supreme G like chemical flavor you know what I'm saying like didn't did not not as bad as supreme G like definitely not as noticeable but you can tell it's kind of and also something I noticed hold on right here you notice it says it's just I crusher which if you know what that website is you can buy bulk carts so I don't know if that means mine is fake or if this company just just uses AI crusher for their carts like I'm not really sure if you have any if you have any additional info that'd be great I definitely get these just to try them out maybe not a long-term solution they're a little little harsh a little uh low quality but not not horrible I've seen much worse I picked these up if you want to try that's about it", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "P8E8X2eYW2s": "you know what's going on YouTube today I mean to one another glow extract cartridge review today I'll be reviewing the banana punch cartridge says it's a hybrid it doesn't have any other information about like percentage or anything because you guys didn't know if it tells you the percentage then it's [ __ ] fake and also before I get into the actual review on the cart if you guys didn't watch my last video the globe extracts it's a black market brand which means it can be verified with the QR code because they are vastly produced technically illegally or whatever which the only reason they're it's illegal is because they don't have actual lab tests and stuff I believe on their website they may have some sort of lab test but it's not like approved by the whoever regulates this stuff I'm not sure I want to say the FDA but pretty sure that's on me for like food and [ __ ] but anyways enough rambling this is the banana punch hybrid the person I got these from they previously did verify the the QR code on the box that includes all of these and so I know it is legit in that aspect this is what the cartridge itself looks like it was laying on its side since what that big bubble is but I have already hit it I know what I think about it but I'm still gonna hit it live for you guys and give you guys my raw taste test on camera so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hit it but you're gonna think oh you guys this this is [ __ ] it's really good it definitely has that banana flavor to it but I definitely wouldn't like relate it to like a Laffy Taffy or any sort of banana like that like if you ever had a banana puff bar or something don't think that this is what it's going to taste like it's more of like a banana terpene like kind of like a banana I can't really describe it 100% but yeah an earthy banana honestly but overall I find the opportunity to choose between any of the flavors from the Glos this definitely wouldn't be my first like my first choice but it definitely wouldn't be at the bottom the only reason why I say it has cuz the I've had other glues that just had like way more of a like add a bit to it like just more of a Terp profile I guess you would say I just they tasted more earthy and made you coffee more but this this is really smooth but it's like not too smooth to the extent where it feels like you're hitting a [ __ ] like a vape or something like I don't know but overall I would definitely get this a solid an 8 out of 10 just because my personal preference with carts and pins or whatever is I like getting that like straight of dad hit like I don't mind coughing my ass off and like nearly dying because that honestly makes you preserve the cart longer and but at the same time it does make you sound like a crack theme so I'm gonna go ahead and stop talking guys hope you guys enjoyed the review go ahead and leave comment for anything else you guys want me review I'm gonna try to continue uploading consistently and I actually have an elgato coming in the mail soon so I will probably be able to start live streaming if that's something that aim was interested in so if you made it this far in the video drop a comment below peace", "RBae2GpGyiI": "what's up guys is why pose I'm back with another little video but this rig is gonna be so quick because now I'm gonna lie I kind of ran out of video ideas so this video is just gonna be like another part two of how to hit you got down cart without a battery if you don't got a battery or if you do have a battery but the battery doesn't work or if it doesn't tap or something okay and I'm gonna make it more briefly because the how to top a ding how to tap your car without a battery my other video like that [ __ ] pop it didn't really even pop I like I got some views that I was not expecting at all not at that point at least and but that videos really sluggish I was like really bleak [ __ ] type of [ __ ] so I'm gonna just do another one part two and yeah so first off what you're gonna need obviously is your wires now I'm not gonna describe I'm going to describe and explained in this video how to make your own wires but you need this you see these things you need these things these are so important this black right here that you see here is gonna go in the bottom of the cart the bottom of the cart see that little thing that hold that little circle that's in your cart yeah the black has to go any right and also your wires or whatever it has to be already connected to something like right now it is being connected to my to my laptop it could be I think connected to your ps4 your little put it in a box put it yeah and see but you definitely do need this and it needs to be in your little out there or whatever already so yeah quick and simple this black right here that you see right there the black this is gonna go inside the cart boom it's already inside the cart right you guys see that right and then the red they see right here you can see it put it right there that red right there that's in my nose that red day see there is gonna come along on top right here you're gonna want to put it next to this like there and you just don't want to leave it there and then as it's in there top it like go and inhale start inhaling and then boom that's does I do it there I guess i'ma do it for you guys though this car Billy huh sir it's gonna take a while to top but like to hit but like is in a work yeah my card so dead the card is really dead but you can still do it when your cards like all the way up or is that like it's a full cart no one is almost basically dead because look guys like my [ __ ] I'm basically flinging on like a dead car right now you know but like I'm doing it for this video so you guys could know just letting you guys know so again this is basically a cart for the tries of doing this with the wires so basically again same [ __ ] you guys are gonna want the black the black is always gonna go in here the black always in DC a circle boom put it circle right there boom put it in the black is in then the pink or the red you're gonna want it here and I doubt right when you put it like that just stop it just hit it just start hitting it the skirt busy eyes but yeah that's it that's how you tap your damn cart with or with no batteries no nothing and yeah cheers I hope you guys enjoy I hope you guys you guys got to hate your cart already like this for the first time you guys learned some [ __ ] I don't know and guys caught me something

today we got the gang Sinatra heard this glow extracts heard this is a new brand it seems pretty legit I mean I could definitely see how this is a filler or something though Mike yeah I'm sure this is a filler but uh this is like really good I guess knockoff oil but I mean in reality it's just this is just DISA lit you know it's just this lit as you guys can see you can see the bubble move but I was just in the car and I hit this at least like three or four times again it's moving really slow I know it looks like it's moving kind of fast because honestly I've had dank vapes before that move slows [ __ ] like way slower and that like doesn't even move type [ __ ] but honestly guys just because the bubble doesn't move like quick at all like I would be more sketch to that because you can add so many different things so that will just to boil and just make it stick or whatever see how I definitely be kind of skeptical of that I didn't cop a pack of these like like the 10 pack or whatever it's kind of similar to TKOs these are it's a seesaw with a white tip on it looks kind of like a fake supreme it's kind of what it reminded me of but not like the hit it's so Jupiter ring see so this is a clear ring it almost looks kind of white from the flash but I promise you guys it is clear so I know that these cards are mass-produced but do I know if they're coming from like a legit company out of California or something I don't know but I mean I'm basically just reviewing the court it so so let's go ahead and get straight into it me hitting it off see so palm and yeah that's why it's bubbly because I hit it like multiple times in the car before I made this video yeah so let's go ahead and pop it on okay and let's go ahead and hit this thing Cheers yes guys right off the bat this dank Sinatra it almost has like at the end of it I was like a berry taste to it the terpenes aren't overdid at all so it's gonna be a smooth consistent hit it's taste really good it's really good and my cats currently like beating on the [ __ ] door so that's why I kind of stopped talking consistently but uh yeah this it gets you high if you're someone that's like really used to basically fake car it's like if you're someone that's used to like terpene filled Danks or whatever then you might not like these just cuz of how smooth they hit you might feel like you're not getting high or whatever just cuz the smooth hit but I promise to you you know I was in the car and I had hit this right when I got it or whatever and I'd already hit cars from earlier but it was about like an hour and a half after I hit a cart previously and the [ __ ] crept up on me quick as [ __ ] guys like not even alive like I knew is some legit this way and I mean honestly if you look like caught on us I wish you could see it in real life I swear you can tell there's like we'll do a will in there guys yeah see the bubbles moving but it's still moving so slow like I've definitely had carts the bubble like just hasn't even moved type should like you couldn't leave it there come back 20 minutes and it's like not even moved half an inch but it really doesn't matter guys it you know it could easily added just a little bit more of something and it definitely could have made this bubble move a lot slower so that means that these are most likely just pure I definitely don't get that much Terps from this which is good but the tert Terps are there though so yeah guys just let me know if you guys want me review anything else thank these go cards damn cool once again thanks an ultra hybrid

VG back at it with another [ __ ] video for you guys man for today's video man I just got out of school your boy is ready to smoke man last night I did end up copying one of my favorite cars hold up I not probably showed it already but I I've copped one of my favorite cartridges of all time right or what used to be my favorite cartridge of all time I it's been a while since I smoked it so I said why not cop it again and let's go ahead and smoke it on for the boys one time and see if I still like it man see if it's still there see if they still got it so if you guys know me you guys know my love for this part right here boys raw garden yes sir one of my favorite cartridges of all time if not my favorite cartridge of all time and you guys know I've I think raw garden has to be one of the one of the brands that I've done several several videos on like I'm talking about probably for the first half of my youtube career I did nothing but carb like cartridges on raw Gardens sauces and things like that man it was [ __ ] phenomenal so hold on I don't even tell you guys what we were smoking on so right here they feel if that book hopefully that's focused in but we got some gorilla gas berry and this is an indica sitting at 84 point 86 THC men and to pair that up though we got that Relaxo m9 battery right here that's this divot this giveaway for this battery is actually still going on it was gonna be a full month's worth of them it was gonna be a full um a full month that I was gonna be doing it it's a little bit over a month so I don't know if you guys are even still aware that's going on but all you have to be doing is following my Instagram page which I'm gonna be playing down description below man and be subscribed to my page so yeah cheers guys get it crack this sucker open you guys know what a raw garden looks like right you got the little yellowish tint little clearish go ahead and smack this on here oh quick one time and man what saddens me is that I cannot find my green ooze battery I don't know if you guys remember my green ooze battery that um that was the my daily driver for a while yeah that was my daily driver for a while I mean I am ended up finding up about this battery and this battery honestly Chuck's so this has been my daily driver since then I've been using on almost all of my cartridges if you guys want to check this one out I'll make sure to put their info down in description below relax om9 thank you for this battery and it's on the red setting let's go ahead and take a Cheers I mean my cheers hey cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over man we back at it with the raw garden videos baby cheers guys I think that might have been a little bit too hot yeah the wrong guy always makes me called you off of that little hit I'm telling you this battery dude the water use on this patty are insane it makes that makes your hits and extremely freakin huge so we're gonna go in on a green I think Green is lowest setting for this so cheers goes whoo oh my goodness that was the perfect hit yo Wow Wow Oh holy [ __ ] you're on e open on my window or something's kind of I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty [ __ ] hot in here so hold on this way for the beep Ian stop all right cool so like I was saying man's been a while since I smoked the raw garden I decided to call a cop went in oh my gosh all for those two to three hits man ah it is phenomenal though that was pretty freakin lame man I finished recording like 12 minutes a 12-minute was supposed to be 12 minutes total of the video and then um it just stopped recording man I was talking about all right so I finished when I checked back the recording it ended off at I was a 2 to 3 hits in and then after that I ended up taking like another three hits and I ended up talking a lot more talking about the battery talking about the giveaway talking about all that stuff so I guess I'm just gonna have to I don't even remember what I said I'm gonna be honest with you guys I don't remember not a damn word that I said B is what I shoot most of these um cartridge videos it's off the top of my head because it's a review video and things like that so it's nothing as planned out nothing is planned out now you guys know that so [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] get into this thing man alright guys so like I was saying two to three hits and deep I mean now we're like 6 or 7 i'm high [ __ ] right now guys we're gonna try to brainstorm so you see where i left off alright so this rock garden cartridge right here that i'm gonna show you guys this is this is the setup that i've been running as of late and honestly this setup is honestly pretty fired like it's it's the m9 Relaxo battery with whatever cartridges but this this battery right here honestly has the best voltages for any cartridges from low temps to high temps it hits all the spots you know and the raw guard you can never go wrong with raw garden man you can never ever ever go wrong with raw garden i think the only thing that i have an issue with with raw garden like i said is like i have an issue with how many times they cross the same strains over and over and over again and i know they're just trying to be like you know creative and trying to find new strains are gonna smack and things like that but honestly do have it's like if you see if you see things not progressing you see them digressing and being the same thing over and over i it maybe you should just try something else you know you're not gonna get better results doing the same thing that's facts this thing gives the fattest hits like oh my gosh that one got me dude I forgot how hard these raw garden cartridges met I honestly I remember I used to freaking get like baked off of like like two to three hits and right now I'm like ten hits deep now I'm obviously frickin blown I'm probably gonna have to just sit here and just be on my phone and chill with the a/c on for a little bit before I do anything but your voice is baked as heck so like I was saying man the my overall experience with raw Gardens I love it there there indica smack all the times for me I feel like the sativas and the hybrids are a no-go I feel like that's not only with rock and I feel that's with all all weed or anything in general men are actually not even but I think with bud and dabs I'm cool with but when it comes to cartridges the hybrids don't do anything for me it has to be a straight-up indicator and that's why I like indicas a lot more than anything oh man this that hate got me bro like I said I'm super baked right now let's give you guys a full rundown so the flavor profile on this [ __ ] already forgot bro [Music] so it has like a little fruitiness at the end when you Excel but a gas the earthy taste when you when you inhale it's pretty smooth it's smoother than most of the raw gardens that I've tried definitely it has a little bit more of a yellowish tint to it also and man it is this is an indica dominant I definitely feel the indica hitting me I'm lumped right now like I said my eyes are actually turning a little bit red so that's actually quite crazy I need a damn very good and then um yeah but like the Tate like I said the taste is phenomenal like every other raw garden that I've ever tried nothing too special but at the same time you know it's better than most of the cartridges that I've tried so raw garden you get you get you get another 8 out of 10 from you man you guys need to make something that's I don't know man you guys need to do something you guys need to do something different for the community I feel like you guys have done a weed thank you for everything that you've done that Bo we kind of want something different man at least from from me man I want something different from you guys so yeah guys I think I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully we at least reach to 10 minutes so you guys can have a good video to watch man let me know in the comments below what you guys what is your guys's experience with raw garden you know what do you guys like about it what don't you like about it what are your what are your favorite strains above them you know because I know they have some of this like I said they were they have some of the same strains that they cross with multiple times so let me know what you guys is favored right now in them in March 2020 man let me know which one's the best one you saw I think that's for me the best one that I have ever smoked from them I think was a the summer Bubba I think this summer Bubba for me was freaking phenomenal or that one or the LG Chem one of those two so yeah like I said I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it man hopefully you guys have a positive blessed day after seeing this video man stay motivated like always and we'll catch you guys in the next word", "-wpVTBst5Ak": "i was good with y'all today i'm gonna be reviewing i know it's been a while right look at me i

showing you guys something that we came across today it's a little unusual but if you guys are a fan of this channel you may have seen my other video where i was telling you guys how to spot a fake glow cartridge well today we actually came across a [ __ ] fake glow cart now when we first got this [ __ ] we were hitting it we didn't really see anything wrong with it but the flavor was [ __ ] off it did taste a little funny so i was taking a closer look at it and i could pretty much tell that it did the cartridge did look a little different from the normal ones that i am usually getting now a birdie he does not approve of this i do not approve of this people should not be making fake cartridges like this this [ __ ] is gonna kill someone um i'm gonna play a close-up video showing you guys more about the cart like the bottom of it but i just want to make this video to if you guys have a glow cart and you're wanting to make sure it's real or not this is a pretty clear way to see if it's real just compared to this cart so i'm gonna play that video real quick oh so these are the cars my guys um as you can maybe see off the bat uh the one on the left has a bigger [ __ ] glow extracts logo in the middle which you know that's a little spooky guys and um also as you can see that [ __ ] thing in the middle that [ __ ] kind of looks big as [ __ ] like thick ass [ __ ] ring in the middle if you guys know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about and this one the middle the middle piece looks pretty damn thin obviously you can't really see it compared to the other one because it's not full but yeah guys that's pretty much what they look like compared to each other and also at the bottom of them hold up let me show you guys this [ __ ] oh there's a little [ __ ] as you guys can see uh the one on the right i don't know how to explain that but you guys see that [ __ ] just looks a little different the font or whatever it's thicker letters yeah so that's kind of what you want to look out if you got a [ __ ] fake blow cart doesn't look a little dark but that [ __ ] has been damn near isn't that right all right guys so this concludes this [ __ ] video but for you guys you know i'ma [ __ ] rip this piece of poop uh [Music] stop it", "YOob-T3xjuU": "what's up what's going on guys rickshaw here for those of you who don't know I make medicinal marijuana extraction and smoking videos I post them on the internet for other people to watch and joy smoke along with and simply learn something sorry for the lack of videos for three years ish I've seen all of your comments requesting comebacks just hasn't been something I've been able to do but figured I'd show you guys this video damn that's a thumbnail right there alright so how to cross th CA out of your BHO mixture the difference in making diamonds from shatter so for shatter you're gonna pour your goopy Taney mixture onto parchment paper and you're gonna throw it in the vacuum chamber and you're gonna let it be gas for like a few minutes if you want and then essentially pull it back then you just flip the slab over and over for the8 diamonds you're going to instead of parchment you're gonna put in a jar I'm not really sure what is this jar is Harrison in my hand when it went into the freezer was probably about three-quarters full with solvent and it's sat there for 48 hours just in this container with some 99 isopropanol and then I took it out put the jar right here let it sit for like 10 minutes I noticed everything that was at the bottom basically dissolved back into the mixture so then after like 10 minutes or so of degassing at room temp it would have been down maybe a little bit more like just over half or something so I'm noticing that pretty much as the solvent breaks down maybe not this time because it's so chunky but as the solvent breaks down everything that crashes out has been redesign back into the solvent and I'm not sure if that's how you're gonna get a big VVS diamond or if that's how it's just gonna be one big chunk across the bottom regardless the only difference in making shatter to thca diamonds is you're going to instead of parchment throw it in a jar pressure doesn't really have anything to do with it from what I've been reading and understanding it has a lot to do with that initial cold crash [Music] some people say like online that you only need to do it for like 12 to 24 hours this is after like six days of reducing the solvent it was some people might say like could have reduced more solvent before doing the initial crash and it wouldn't have taken so long in the freezer but it like it's it's not about the headspace it's about your saturation to evaporation ratio and I wanted to keep it super saturated to like just crash out anything I possibly could because I  this up like six times now one of the first times I ever did a batch of diamonds it went really really well actually the very first time I can't focus on the bottom there and then pretty much every time since I seem to read as all the THC a back into it and get some super small diamonds this is open blasting waxes fats and lipids are fully intact and it's nine different strains so that contradicts most things that you read online I'm sorry guys I just cannot focus on the bottom there regardless I'm gonna cap it and throw it back in the freezer now let it crash for maybe another 1224 hours or so yeah I guess I'll be like part two or something I don't know okay bye", "rcPM-4_q5jY": "okay washed some my GC crystals that can pump two perched it a little bit this a little bit how much to see any diamonds in an alcohol wash and I'm just purchased it for 20-30 minutes what Bridget listen tonight let's rocket fuel killing missed this is washed
