{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram at Sahab so Lani otherwise I will see you in the next video take care and please medicate responsibly", "gwOllzEeJ7c": "how's it going everyone back again on the way back home from the dyspo walking

"u7KE2WOgoL8": "good evening happy st patrick's day happy singing projects day i'm amber and this is kelly and we're going to do another video for you guys so tonight we thought given that it's saint patrick's day we would maybe go ahead and do something green we're not very festive tonight callie yeah or not no well your shirt says happy oh my bracelet and your your bracelet's green your sweater this morning was green but i'm not very festive with my red and my black but that's okay we're making sure we are we are going to make a green shamrock shake because we love shamrock shakes we used to love shamrock shakes at mcdonald's mcdonald's when we used to eat mcdonald's we don't eat mcdonald's very often anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting to join us now go and watch the replay we'll post the recipes in the comments and enjoy yourself

oil coming out of these i'm gonna have well-moisturized hands by the time i'm done this recipe which isn't such a bad thing moisturize with your hands you can holly hello okay miss cali well thanks again for joining us we hope you enjoyed this video and we hope to see you again on sunday good night bye bye", "2xbWaBe-_hk": "i'm emily osterberg founder of baking betty's here at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and we use premier's new edible ink printer eddie for printing all our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "TjgdAFv6sCU": "[Music]", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy chicken spicy chicken was the flavor i chose of my soup um uh oh my god i'm so hot and the soup is hot i'm gonna open my window the temperature why is it so hot what temperature is it in here it's only 22 degrees what's going on oh yeah that's a look okay i'm gonna finish this off camera because and then i'm gonna report back once i feel like it has hit me i'm gonna let you guys know how it goes okay okay i'll see you guys anywhere between well i mean it's gonna be immediately after for you but it's gonna be like two hours probably for me depending on how fast it hits me actually i should have added some muscle than into this but since i didn't i'm

you know right here stay true around here be sure to like comment subscribe tell me what you like for saint patty's day in the comment section below baby and i'ma see y'all next video you know the vibes baby", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a

and today we're going to learn how to make the palm maple sour now to make the palm maple sour you're going to need a few ingredients starting with our reunion moonshine maple flavored we're also going to need some pomegranate juice on top of that a little bit of lemon juice and of course we've got some rose bitters we're also gonna need a little bit of sugar to rim our glass as the garnish apart from that if you got all those things you're set to go [Music] now let's get to it so we're gonna start off here with one and three quarter ounces of our maple moonshine i'm gonna put that right into our shaker tin right here we're gonna follow that with some pomegranate juice so the pomegranate juice we're gonna go just under one ounce so we're looking at three quarters of an ounce this will add a nice tartness it's got a nice depth of flavor as well which goes really really nicely with the darker notes of this maple flavored moonshine we're gonna add a little bit of brightness however with a little bit of lime juice sorry lemon juice just a half ounce we already have a lot of tartness coming from the pomegranate juice this will add a little bit of acidity balance out this cocktail now we want to add a little bit more depth a little bit more complexity of this cocktail this is where the rose bitter comes in handy so we're going to add two to four dashes depending on how long your dashes are and then we're gonna be set to shake now before i add ice to this cocktail i'm going to rim my glass so that it's ready to pour right away so we don't have any more extra dilution so to rinse your glass simply grab a piece of lemon rub it on the side walls of your glass if you have any seeds just flick off the seeds no big deal and then we're going to get the wet part of the glass on the walls here and we're just going to dab that into some white granulated sugar now if you choose you can rim the whole glass i prefer to just do a bit of a half rim that way if i'm serving i guess they don't like the sugar they still have a nice lip here that doesn't have any sugar so that way they get a bit of an option now that our glass is ready to go we're just gonna add some ice here and we're gonna give this a nice sturdy shake typically when you're shaking you want to shake this really hard because you want to wake up your drink right you want to make sure everything's nice and blended together you'll want to make sure that everything is chilled and a little bit diluted now that we got everything mixed in here what we're going to do is just strain this into our glass if you have a double strainer i do recommend that you use it it'll grab those extra shards of ice that have broken into your tin and it won't over dilute your drink and that palm juice makes a nice little froth on top absolutely beautiful and here we have it our cocktail our palm maple sour enjoy", "YCS06vRqDF8": "what's gonna make the crust with crush things so i can't do videos actually whoever's

lovely people later bye yeah", "H6md_iTZGc4": "hi guys happy Monday its medical Monday with dr. Leslie Apgar today I'm joined with my girls we got Tracy Scott's flower and we've got two vana Austin both from grassroots so everybody waved hi so thanks you guys for coming and hanging out all right now Devon I just met you today I think I might have met you way back when we way back in the summer was my girl Tracy and I go way back and we are so grateful for you guys to come back thank you for having so first Tracy you get to go first tell us how you got to be in this role what is your role at crossroads so I am basically what you would call a relationship its manager which is basically sale if you want to be honest you're the one who tells us I'm the one that oh you're your failure dispensary and help you with your products awesome but I I basically fell into this okay I mean I did this kind of job back in the day sales okay but a friend had told me that they were looking for a person that was good at selling basically and and I went and I talked to him and I was like this is an amazing industry and I'm so passionate about healing and helping you know and that's how it happened I love it yeah about two davana so I started smoking weed in college and I was also following the industry because I thought it was interesting and I decided to write my thesis on the growth of the cannabis industry oh wow and at the same time Maryland's program was getting started so I found Danny Cohen our owner and met with him periodically over the summer after graduation and now I'm here I do marketing and outreach for grassroots so getting hard exactly so you guys may see these people out in the community well again we really appreciate you guys coming by today so let's talk a little bit about what makes grassroots different like why should our patients be purchasing from grassroots over any of the other grows that are out there well first and foremost you know the one thing that I love about this company is its passion for helping and serving me serving my dispensaries us serving the patients and and even our motto is to serve advance and respect them you guys you guys always say that you do we people joining washtech join the movement right right and we have actually been to their grow just beautiful and obviously you guys put your money where your mouth is because we have just received a very large shipment this is RSO for those of you who are wondering it says so right on the container are as Oh which we love that you guys are making that a priority and also making it affordable for the patient yes Aurra so I would say is probably our most medical product out of you know the many that we will have and that we do have now as you know it's helps with cancer tumor so much I mean there's been tons of studies all different ailments and our processor loves making it he says it's fun mm-hmm and I said great because I know they're already so them and Sierra and I have talked about this in the past but are so is really good for patients who are fighting cancer patients who have chronic medical illnesses and planetory disorders so it's got a lot of uses and we're so thrilled that we have a big supply so that we can really help our patients yes we just have to say a heartfelt thank you for doing that and thank you for helping you know that patients know we talked to Matt earlier who was Matt except Matt garbowski who is our head of processing the processing okay in our company though Matt actually gave us some pretty interesting feedback and I wanted to pass that on to our patients who are watching and that is to please respect grassroots RSO because not all RSO is created equal and this is incredibly strong incredibly he doesn't actually expect anybody with any kind of tolerance to be able to tolerate a full syringe daily he wants us to start off just as 1/10 the syringe to begin with and then to work our way up but he's not thinking that we would actually be able to get a full syringe and daily even after a month of trying to increase our tolerance yes I mean I guess it depends on every you know everyone is different every ailment you know every you have to listen to your body and that's you know we always talk about micro dosing right but yeah you know it is so apparently so potent I've never tried it but it's so potent that he wants you to take it easy whereas there might be other products that were less potent or for whatever reason was may different that you can maybe and have a little bit more he also had mentioned that when you ingest rather than this is both edible and smokeable so when you ingest it it's like 10 times more powerful a longer right so it really it's dependent upon that and the way that we ingest it correct or take it in yeah and then also just to clarify that we have two strains we have khaleesi and we have dead cherries and look to him in his estimation there's really essentially no difference between the two and I've looked at these and kind of you know evaluated the terpene profiles they don't look to be any different to me so I think they'll be fairly interchangeable for the patient's yeah it'll be nice okay so that's great information for the patients so yes we have it guys we've got lots of RSO so come and get it that's amazing yes some of the other things that we are carrying that we have in stock because I know we sell out of your stuff a lot I guess we'll start with your favorite this is my favorite a beautiful nightmare it's just a great product I happen to sometimes get heart palpitations when I use a sativa as you lean toward anxiety is that true my friend sometime I have a little anxiety right now that's some time but so I but I like a sativa because I'm and I like birthday and I like right I have a lot to do and this is just a great ride if L it does their main it doesn't upset your hurt no it doesn't it doesn't you might wanna mention about the CBD with that too or no oh yes yes yes because one of the tricks to being able to tolerate this a little bit better is to take CBD as well which we appreciate and the reason why I thought about that at the same time is because sometimes when you do have that that kind of heart-fluttering publication you just you know take a little CBD and it'll that works really well yeah yeah all right here's another real popular crowd-pleaser the Pelle Roja yeah I love that job this is something that sells very well very uplifting and then we have three as your favorite so actually he likes oh you like so Mambo sauce is my favorite so a lot of people like they're really skunky smell or cheesy this one's sweet it's no sweet and so I really enjoy it it burns nice and then what else do we have and then there's sweet D yeah it was named after me my name is Donna I was on that they also did name beautiful nightmare too laughter you just kidding that's just nightmare faceoff is also apparently great for like locations Wow it was just a no it was the pain yeah we're like if you have cramping is that do we talk about Sossamon area painful cramps yeah yeah these patients love the face off for the pain component totally and the one that you're missing is our blue sticker which is our hybrids and some of them lean sativa some of them lean hybrid I mean indica you know but our grower will say there's no such thing our poor patients have heard me talk about that but it's really important to educate the public because you know you see people are maybe not the old for all patients but you know a lot of people are like I need the most THC most THC it's not about the to you it's not it's about the plant and the breakdown all of it and how it's going to be wrong that's correct and it's not just about you know explaining the plant it's about removing that stigma and bringing legitimacy to the industry you know right as part of outreach we speak to anyone who will listen you know we go into hospitals and you know old-age home exactly assess elevating churches temples we try anywhere I'm sit on this conversation right if you show them it's not that scary you know people are curious yeah they know the guy helpful hear about it humans have been using this planet for thousands and thousands of years so now it's just time for the studies to you know watch a street yeah exactly how those of you were watching Dateline last night I know that I'm saying lovely little taste of what's to come so yeah finally we are catching up yeah so and so this is some of the stuff that we have available right now at greenhouse what are some of the things that you guys have in the works for us so actually we just spoke about it today more processing products we have disposable pens that are coming out within a week or two they're called torches they're 500 they are at a nice price point gorgeous it's just you know if you especially for somebody who's not looking to smoke weed but maybe wants to just be able to start off and is new to this type of introduced and we also have chatter coming and waxes and even though you know you wouldn't think that you know somebody who might be older or is is some kind of you know there's a stigma I feel like sure that a lot of people like that a lot of it you know a lot of people like life as well we love libraries and I mean that I like that yeah and it really it can helpful it can help a lot too I really have a medical anodized makes sense to me that you take that whole plant master rs7 exactly higher plan know about everything it gives you every benefit right you know the substrate totally I mean it's just it's a really incredibly we're talking about off camera I used to self-medicate and then I became a patient and it's wild for me to you know know the back stories and know the terpenes and know everything and I'm like oh and might have some crayons or you know whatever it might be and I know that if I take a certain strain it's gonna help me and it does it's pretty and it's wonderful you know your your stomach relaxes you maybe aren't nauseous like it's just amazing fruits balance right it does and it's just wild to me that something like this would have a stigma and we need to be doing community outreach that compared to other but this was filled with oxycontin it would be okay saying and it's just it's crazy it is a little silly yeah you've never heard one person died of an overdose not one nope it's impossible possible but if you take all of this you're gonna be in your areas especially if you eat it because I'll stay in your system for yeah all right well what else did you guys want at the public to know about grassroots is there any last little pearl or anything you want anybody to know well they can always reach out to us if I don't have any questions concerns we are truly here to serve our community and this industry and you guys and we just really believe in this product you're passionate it's not about you know uhyou it's hard to not read things on Facebook it's hard to not be affected by oh this sucks that sucks this is a very young industry right we're there's growing pains but I can promise you from the bottom of our hearts we're in it to help people and make people feel better and you know just how it not be such a not be illegal and I just you know be able to feel better well we have I finger questions we have a question from Blake he wants to know what you guys have thoughts are on oil color you see sometimes an amber color versus good dark which I've seen yeah and what causes the difference in color when processing well I was told and again I'm no chemist by any means okay but what I was told by our head processer Matt garbowski that you know I again I saw him Facebook bleep that there you know somebody said that's not RSO it's too light it's supposed to be tar it's chlorophyll right there's all different processes but Matt believe if he will tell you that it when you put it on something and you rub it out it should be like a golden color it should not be at our it should not be I think those are the impurities quite a yes is that what it is so yeah but I haven't have Reds on and and people just need to be educated right so thanks for the question Blake yeah that's a great question all right guys well I think that about wraps it up for our motivating wasn't that they hardly needed any CBD to get through this just all right guys well thank you so much for joining us you'll see us again next Monday for our next Medical Monday [Music]", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what

dangerous can they be how deadly are they for human beings how destructive are they for vessels can whirlpools suck ships boats or even barges in or do they pose a danger only for human beings who fall into them in these shots you can see how the rafter Steve Fisher got sucked in by a powerful current that the athlete had the bad luck to encounter when descending the Congo River as part of a red bull sponsored competition Fisher a world-class athlete had a run-in with the mighty rapids of this African River yet this was not among the most dangerous whirlpools that exist on our planet and far from the most dangerous whirlpools and that are theoretically possible don't try at home what one of the world's top drafting pros barely managed to escape from and that was even with the help of others there are whirlpools much more dangerous than along the Congo River some of these vortexes in the water pose a threat not only to people would even heavier objects a boat a yacht a ship a barge even giant vessels can face destruction if any of them separately or together are sucked into one of these real aquatic monsters but let's start by taking a look at whirlpools themselves at what they are how they arise and what real danger and destructive force they pose no not like that whirlpools are not specially stirred up by anyone rather they form in their own due to internal processes currents in a body of water collide and merge and thereby they create circular flows that are made stronger by the turbulence as if the waters being turned inward if there is a deep hole under the water and above this hole tons of water are flowing from opposite directions towards each other a vortex is created and this is what a world actually is let's try to helpfully illustrate this principle with oddly enough a clockwork mechanism as we explained you'll understand why we chose precisely this as an example you can see how the tirelessness appears in a clockwork mechanism drive one another on by rotating as they constantly grip on one another with their teeth each of these gears rotates only because the entire ensemble of rotates together they never slowed down by friction against one another but rather they work together in mutual movement now imagine that these are not little gears at all but water currents the flow of water when there is turbulence and currents moving towards each other will rotate from the impact just like these gears the principle of torque is basically analogous only water unlike the gears in a clockwork mechanism there's more than just rotate and if there's the necessary turbulence it'll form a funnel that sucks things in thus for a whirlpool to arise in nature we need the following a sufficient mass of moving water the presence of currents moving in opposite directions within this mass and a pit that's deep enough to generate a flow that swells inward generally the fastest whirlpools are those of mountain rivers that can sometimes reach speeds of several miles per hour however mountain rivers do not have an amount of water sufficient to suck truly large objects in people and animals often perish in these currents but larger objects for example ships are just too big for mountain rivers to affect for those big objects you need to bring out the heavy artillery the salt Stroman whirlpool norway today is perhaps the world's most powerful naturally forming well pool it arises four times per day precisely every six hours in a straight that is one point eight six miles long and 492 feet wide and connects to salt Jordan and the skier stat fought with the Barents Sea in this hellish funnel there are gigantic volumes of water that move at unimaginable speeds over a single cycle the salt straw Manuel pulled circulates billions of cubic feet of liquid all in a speed of up to 23 miles per hour if a person fell into such a whirlpool then sadly the chances for survive aslim and even if a whole boat fell in it's believed that the salt straw and whirlpool does not pose a risk to large vessels but to avoid any tragedy traffic in the Strait is scheduled to avoid the times when the dangerous Norwegian whirlpool comes to life the Maelstrom a well pulled famous from Edgar Allan Poe's short story a descent into the Maelstrom similar whirlpools are found in Norwegian waters in the Norwegian Sea these are less brutal than the salt Stroman whirlpool but much more unpredictable and sneaky and so they are no less dangerous indeed they can be even more dangerous Maelstrom flotation barely ever exceeds eight miles per hour but these whirlpools are dangerous because of how sudden they can appear the rocks the currents everything here is set up in a way that makes it impossible to predict when the vortex will arise and how fast it will spin and when water will begin to be sucked into it maelstroms just like the salt storm and whirlpool can form several times per day but there's no rhyme or reason to their formation they might appear two or three times a day they might appear five or six times in such cases are known infamously people have been killed or severely injured in maelstroms on a number of occasions maelstroms are capable of overturning even small fishing boats and such incidences have happened today ships prefer to give these Norwegian monsters a wide berth in order to avoid tragedy the Naruto whirlpools these come in at number three in their danger to life and limb and are rightly called the Japanese wonder nowhere else in the world is there such a large number of powerful whirlpools in such close vicinity to one another it's practically impossible to escape them if you break free from one you immediately fall into another these vortexes spend only in the Naruto Strait under a bridge close to the city of Naruto three or four whirlpools conform at the same time on average every six hours the average diameter of each of the Naruto whirlpools is 50 feet but the diameter constantly changes depending on the frequency and intensity of the Evan flow in the Strait the peak activity of the Naruto well pulls occurs during the spring flood at that time these whirlpools grow to a diameter of 65 feet in the speed at which they rotate reaches as high as 13 miles per hour the Naruto whirlpools are a magnificent sight but only at a safe distance getting up close and personal with these wonders of nature is not recommended the salt Stroman well pool maelstroms the Naruto whirlpools these are gigantic vortexes that exist under natural conditions but let's imagine how big a whirlpool can grow that's created artificially through technological means for this we need to make the strongest current that already exists on our planet and make it spin through powerful turbulence causing the current to become even more deadly the world's most powerful current is the Antarctic circumpolar current also known as the west wind drift it flows around Antarctica and is approximately three times more powerful than the Gulf Stream the length of the west wind drift is over eighteen thousand six hundred miles and its maximum width is around one thousand five hundred and fifty three miles over one second this monster of a current moves 200 million tons of water along and over just one minute 12 billion tons this unimaginably fast amount of water dozens or hundreds of thousands of billions of tons is swept along at a speed of 190 feet per second now if we exploded say a few 20 to 30 Megaton atomic bombs around the perimeter of the west wind drift under the tectonic plates then due to the holes that are formed in the oceanic crust a whirlpool will be created with five to ten times faster than the raging river current that swept Steve Fisher alone imagine that rushing at you with the speed of a car is an entire ocean this is what our artificially created whirlpool would be like with the amount of water that would be involved hundreds of billions of tons of only would ships yachts boats and barges disappear and so would entire fleets of many thousands of vessels oil rigs and any other structure that's in the path of this wild Antarctic current in addition as a result of such a catastrophic development currents and even the sea level could change all over the globe will return to artificially created whirlpool shortly but for now let's turn away from these horror stories and back to reality and to our champion athlete Steve Fisher do you see how hard this was on the extreme athlete Fisher later says that he nearly drowned and that it was a miracle that he's still among the living he was saved by the fact that he had an air cylinder with him underwater Fisher was able to continue breathing with it for about a minute and then he was pulled ashore fish's many years of experience in the sport and high level of qualification was still not enough to save him from a run-in with this fast-moving River current even a whirlpool that's not among the world's strongest and nevertheless be a mortal danger and now here's a real example of an artificially created giant whirlpool that turned out to be thousands of times more dangerous than that one in the Congo 7 a.m. on Friday November the 21st 1980 at eeeem of drillers from Wilson brothers corporation was prospecting for oil underneath the bottom of Louisiana's Lake Pena however under the lake bed was an old salt mine and the drillers did not take this minor detail into account during the drilling a hole was punched into a shaft in the old mine at a depth of around 1,300 feet what happened is something that no one could have imagined the water plunged down into the space that had opened up instantly demolishing the walls vaulting and supports of the mine shaft on the surface an enormous whirlpool formed 180 feet in diameter and it destroyed a tugboat a drilling rig 11 barges a whole island with a Botanical Garden on it dozens of trucks and even several houses luckily not a single human life was lost a whirlpool of such immense power could easily pull the legendary Titanic to the bottom as that ship's mass was several times smaller than the total mass that the artificially created Lake Pina well pool sucked in the most surprising thing about this incident is that the video of it has got a lot of likes on the internet and only because luckily not a single human life was lost is there any chance that a person aboard a ship could survive after being sucked into such a mega whirlpool to make it out alive you'd need a seriously strong capsule that could withstand the water pressure of many tons and in addition that'd have to be a large amount of air in the capsule take for example what happened when the tugboat Jass gone for was crushed the tug boat capsized and sank off Nigeria on May the 26th 2013 everyone on board died except the ship's cook Harrison Okene he was fortunate enough to lock himself in an airtight cabin and survived underwater for three days before being rescued when rescuers bought akkanee up to the surface it turned out that an air pocket formed in the space where the cooker sought refuge and that's why Harrison Okene was not crushed however the chance is that any other person on a sinking ship would be so lucky a slim so to survive a mega well pool you need to be in a capsule which is a hermetically sealed air bubble and of course rescuers have to arrive quickly as you might soon run out of oxygen otherwise if there is no hermetically sealed compartment with an air pocket then the many tons of water around you will do their work they will instantly crush the space itself and everyone inside of it secondly such a powerful whirlpool always forms when the depths reach hundreds of feet and it's impossible to escape from such a depth just on your own although if the depth is not great not 13 to 1,700 feet but just 50 to 65 feet the chances are still slim a person would have to have an incredible level of physical fitness to swim up from under fifty or sixty five feet of water for an ordinary person already at a depth of ten feet due to the water pressure the diaphragm is unable to expand enough for the lungs to fully fill with air all-in-all whirlpools are no joke it's best to avoid them even the smallest ones even gentle little whirlpools can grow stronger at any moment leaving even experienced pros unable to get out of them that's all for today we hope you liked the video don't forget to tell us your suggestions for future topics in the comments if we choose your suggestion we'll mention you in a future video thanks for watching [Music] you", "wYX_zhlTDr8": "you tried these new berries and cream starburst pardon me what could have stopped busters you just say very Larry's better than what else and cream Oh berries and cream berries and creams I'm a little out of those berries and cream there is a grave there is a pretty mom with a lot of those berries cream [Music]", "hebvgdlyzYQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] good morning so I finally made it and I am now in drum roll made as a candidate I got here last night around like I want to say three four in the morning I would have blogged like me driving stuff but that's kind of boring and I would have did customs but customs is not name playing no games at that border she was not only I was some little friendly stuff she was not only and I pulled up somebody come on radio off I said he gets he'll be twice miss lady turned it off and she asked me five thousand questions literally questions I don't even understand why you need to know the answer to well how much money do you have on you why do you need to know that everything is just so nice here like it's just generally just nice the view is nice the Sun feels nice low you can see the Sun reflecting off my skin right now but I will say last night when I got here there was snow on the ground not like three inches of snow heavy snow but really I was driving around through some of the neighborhoods and stuff and they were powerless no yards full of snow and now I wake up this morning to sunnysean it and there are people downstairs swimming in the pool so our regions don't know how things work at Toronto it's clearly they just do it different here apparently you can snow one day and then you wake up and go swim in the next so hey I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna go put my swim trunks and I'm gonna go get in that pool later today but for now I'm just get my day started on the shower get dressed for today and then I'm gonna go explore some of the smoke shops because weed is legal in Canada so I'm gonna go see what's that's like I see if they got a gasser another thing I know gasps I'm gonna clown the whole store because you just cannot have a weed shop used to finish smelling rage now after that I'm gonna get some lunch or something and then I'll probably go I don't know today I'm in like a relaxing move so maybe I should go do some chilled stuff like our own little Museum or something go get a massage go spicy a little bit see what I can get myself into see if I can find a place to take pictures at and then after that I'll probably try to get some more food well let you see what we get let's just see where the day takes me I fell to the small shop that's my first mission smoke shops cuz I have to go see this is gas or not cause if it's not gas listen all right to get ready and we gonna air through the smoke shops okay so the hard part is now finished I got already did everything I had to do have my little pre-party turned up in my hotel room now the first stop is to go get lunch so I was looking online and the first thing God that popped up for like good food places he was plantain and it's supposed to be like this vegan place and I'm like have vegan have ice to eat chicken tenders whatever is not that it's not important but we're gonna try a plan to see if it's any good and then what you don't see what a day takes us hopefully Fanta is good because honestly I'm very hungry like very very hungry and I just don't have time for my foods to not be good because if my food is not good it's just gonna be a bad time all around for everybody involved all parties the waiter the manager the doorman the security guard at the parking lot everybody's gonna have a bad day if this food is bad but it is cross no bad vibes we gon expect this to be good let's hit the planter and dad so I just left plants on not too long ago the food is actually really good it fills you up really fast I wasn't able to finish my whole meal but I got the general gist of it and it was actually really good um I had an energizer shot the orange drink that was an energizer shot and it had like ginger in it that was actually to me nasty but it's only because I don't like ginger not because of anything else the lemonade was good fries are good they had some like dipping sauce I don't know what it was she said it was like dijon or something but I didn't hear what she said so now I am on my way to the smoke shop that is on the corner it's either this tree that I'm walking towards or the other Street but I'll figure that out after I start walking I guess I'm gonna go see what the smoke job is about hopefully they got good guess so that okay no you have seen but somebody will see what that's about hopefully I let me record in there if they don't then I'll try to like sneak a couple get a couple videos or something for ya everybody can see what's going on in the smoke shop because I'm curious as to how they do this here in how they I'm curious to how they go about the we stuff here too because it's legal here but it's not legal in the state so I'm wondering we don't see how they um how do you operate with the whole week [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I'm back from the smoke shop back in my hotel room and I got some food on the way to the smoke shop was crazy it's like a whole like personal shopper in it like somebody follows you around a store but I don't follow you but like you can go up to somebody and ask them like oh can I get some help and then they have like this little tablet thing where they walk around the store with you basically and tell you about each turn each other disposable pens the pre-rolls all type of stuff while you were on tell you about everything the name she rang you up on the thing and he goes at the front and check out they do ID you at the door though because I think in Canada you have to be 19 in order to buy legal marijuana but yeah that was super dope and then food was I just went to the bottom the floor level in my hotel and got a turkey burger from the little cafe down there but let me show you what I got from the hallway story so this is the bag it comes in I spent honestly I could not tell you how much I spend was in Canadian dollars and not a US so I don't know I spend a hundred twenty Canadian dollars it you know either convert that to us okay this is afraid it's already open don't don't only or nothing this is a disposable DAP in whoa there's disposable with THC pen it's tangerine dream innocence sativa him and it actually tastes just like oranges like its Lily just like oranges I don't really like it because I don't like oranges blood is what is the actual pin looks like it's already at the box because I was ripping it in a car I poured it like 20 times so there's that that was the disposable pan was 38 Canadian dollars again if you know how to convert it you got it okay this is the good supply Royal Highness pre-rolled blowing that's what it looks like it's not open yet because I didn't phone my readers need to bless yet that was 14 canadian dollars and as you can buy them one for you come bottom as singles or you can buy them in like some of them come in packs how about when it's a pack this is a single so it was one for one gram but then some of them say like five four five minutes which means that there's five blunts in there well five four one gram so it'll be five blunts in there at each dunno one gram this is an indica THC pyro blunt this is oh it's called Soleil oh this is there were new strands it's a reduced rate this is the one that grows only about its carbon new it's an indica and this is a female but it's 10 Canadian dollars and it's 14.5 so this is 0.5 Grambling also I'm not at telling nobody to smoke I'm not advocating nobody to go smoke out their smoke I'm just saying this is what I do she's known to get her money on me but I'm not very smart this is the houndstooth hybrid notice it's a sativa help sooth sativa one gram this is the actual flower here they call them flowers this is the actual like look you gotta roll up it you know this person got explaining this off this is the five things I was talking about so there's five pre-roll blessing here and there each one gram this is the the boss it's called the Boston Tea Party yeah and that is 31 Canadian dollars and these are it doesn't say but I'm trying to remember where I picked them up at in a store I want to say it's a sativa yeah it definitely is yes is this even yeah so that's pretty much I don't like to see what the rest of this stuff just all these products hitting like again I'm sure yeah that's pretty much it for today I just pick up tomorrow I started doing more stuff but let's taking the view one last time before a game for the day [Music] [Music]", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "FZD3SldXppQ": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of that crazy weird confusing and sometimes a little anxiety inducing place called your dispensary and if yours is anything like mine sometimes it is a little overwhelming even for a guy who tries to keep up with all of the different weed products and companies and different consumption methods uh it seems like new things are being cooked up every day in that regard which is exciting to see but can be overwhelming as a consumer today though we're not going to talk about something overwhelming nothing new nothing novel one of the oldest forms of weed edibles that there are is something singular plural um and that that is the good old-fashioned weed gummy yes we are going to be reviewing some weed gummies and one from a favorite brand in our past one uh who is more known for their chocolate bars but now is branching out to the gummy world and that is punch punch edibles a lot of people really like the punch reviews in the past we reviewed these guys years ago they've been around since the um good old uh gray market um more uh only medical days making 200 and i believe 25 milligram chocolate bars uh and they've been around um they continued to exist throughout our new 100 milligram cap era where they curiously uh continued making chocolate bars but they only ever come in 90 varieties there's uh they don't go to the 100 they do 90. why i'm not sure um and it looks like their gummies follow suit as this is a their excuse me tangerine lemon a pink grapefruit citrus flavor all those are citrus fruits assumedly um and it is only 90 milligrams of thc probably shows up a little bit more clearly on those lab testing results in the back or 90.5 milligrams of thc not sure why they don't do the full 100 um but if it's anything like their chocolate bars they you know hit above their weight glass i apologize for the terrible pun i'm sure i've even made it before god damn me um but you know it's uh who knows it's got me talking about it right so this is a 90 milligram edible uh and like their chocolate bars uh they are a more affordable edible uh on the cheaper end i picked this up from my uh beloved dispensary in long beach for 12 buckaroonies and may or may not focus there but yeah not uh not bad for a 90 milligram edible usually trending a couple dollars down from the average so again but you get 10 less thc supposedly uh so without further yammering about this citrus punch fruit snack let's go ahead and open it up see what we got now we got a little dosing guide here uh it shows you what we need we've got 10 or excuse me nine 10 milligram squares because you can divide a square up that way for you geometry fans harder to divide a square into ten very easy to divide it into nine um that's for you arithmetic fans so uh it's got a fancy little plastic contraption very uh uh unnecessary in terms of packaging but you know i've seen more ostentatious but that's a hell of a lot of plastic for no real reason and then we got the extra plastic wrapping this that all says 90 milligrams 90 milligrams everywhere on it oh okay so it is three different flavors of gummies not one giant citrus catch-all smorgasbord kind of handsome looking very starbursty looking and very starburst colored i wonder if pink will be the best here as well let's go ahead and try one of each so i'm going to go and uh like all of our weeds reviews say this every time i review the whole uh product i'm going to review all 90 milligrams that are here i'm not going to necessarily do all 90 right now in front of you but i'll do them over the next hour or so and then two hours after i have that very last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly what we think of these very affordable punch edibles citrus flavored so this pink one is i'm gonna guess the tangerine no this orange one that i've got i'm gonna get my colors right that's tangerine hmm that is a gelatinous cube um quite a bit of weed taste um not as pristine uh a um gummy taste uh or a flavored gummy taste as like a plus or a steezy gummy it's not terrible but there is a definite weed aftertaste to these lemon yum and then for the star of the show the pink grapefruit i'm just going to pretend it's a pink starburst because my mind will make it taste better pink starburst [Music] tastes exactly like it wow okay yeah very strong very strong wheat taste um not overwhelming and you know uh they are more affordable and hopefully that means that they are just potent as af [ __ ] uh and for that we're just gonna have to wait and see i got six more of these guys to go as i said i'll do them over the next hour so how fun was that and once i'm done two hours after that see right back here until then stay high stay healthy i don't know why i tell you to do that you're just gonna see me in a couple seconds anyways i'll see you then [Music] hello guys i'm back it has been uh three ish hours maybe three and a half hours uh since my first piece of the cannabis infused punch fruit snacks um and i am very very happy to tell you nice and simply uh really like this stuff doesn't taste great but it does the trick um even with its 90 milligrams it still feels pretty strong to me um not a lot to have to get through just nine tiny little squares you're good to go or one if that's what your tolerance limit is um yeah and then of course the most impressive part of the entire package is gonna be that price uh usually you can get these substantially or you know somewhat cheaper than other edibles at the same or almost same dosage um and so if these are cheaper for you if these are a couple bucks cheaper than the next level up grab these these will do you um uh they're fruit snacks well i'm always gonna be a chocolate guy uh and i'm gonna always prefer punch bars chocolate bars the fruit snacks um holding their own for punch that's for sure um they're uh two for two on products as far as i'm concerned so that's a big old thumbs up from me uh and that means anytime we do those big old thumbs up we're gonna do a little cherry on top a little something extra that you know not necessarily weed related you can enjoy with or without weed it's up to you it's just a little cherry on top just a little something extra uh and this week uh i'm gonna make sure you guys keep those hbo max subscriptions um from lapsing you don't wanna cancel now you know you've only been a subscriber for however many months it's been around too i i feel like all these subscription services are sort of bundling together in my brain they're all launching at the same time it's all pretty wild anyways hbo max you got that one probably and if you do check out the righteous gemstones there's only one season it's another show from um i was gonna say wonderkind danny mcbride but that seems like um whatever the opposite of hellion kid whatever the opposite of wonder is is kind of danny mcbride um righteous gemstones is the uh story of a christian televangelist patriarch um played by jeff goodman and his three bumbling sons one of them played by danny mcbride who's also a show co-creator um and uh it tells the story of what a bunch of bumbling hypocritical [ __ ] the leaders of a massive um uh christian organization are and it's very funny and um judy one of the children of um jeff goodman the children of the patriarchy one of the main characters of the show the daughter uh one of the funniest performances i've seen in my entire life had me laughing constantly uh this cherry on top is for the righteous gemstones but there's an extra cherry on top of that cherry for i can't remember the actress's real name her name is judy gemstone in the show it's a great name judy gemstone try saying it yourself judy gemstone big thumbs up punch citrus tangerine lemon pink green food big thumbs up everything's coming up aces see you guys on the next review stay high stay healthy more important to stay healthy goodbye", "sMsrEdcGEwE": "what is up kilo crew and welcome to today's video today we are doing not one not two but three massive boxes of fruity pebbles cereal now i'm really excited to be doing this video in collaboration once again with molly skylar and dan killer kennedy we have each decided to take on three 15 ounce boxes of we'll just say pebbles because i know molly skyler has decided to do cocoa pebbles along with one whole gallon of milk so we're just going to have some fun with this please be sure y'all head over to mollyskyler and dankiller kennedy's pages hit that like button hit that subscribe button on their attempts at this challenge this is going to be a ton a ton of food this equates to pretty much just shy of 12 pounds when you include the milk so this is going to be absolutely insane but let's go ahead and pour us some cereal [Music] [Music] so well there you have it folks this is only two and maybe i don't even think a quarter of the boxes of fruity pebbles cereal just the cereal alone in a one gallon bowl and that's what it looks like so the rest of the cereal is still in here i'm going to be pouring it later into some smaller bowls but for now it's time to take an epic thumbnail get ourselves situated grab some milk and a spoon and get this challenge underway all right crew we are all set up and ready to go again this is three 15 ounce boxes of fruity pebble cereal along with one full gallon of milk and again this is not all of the cereal so i'm going to go ahead and pour the remaining bits in these two smaller bowls just so that y'all can see it out and doing its thing see if it even fits in these smaller bowls oh my goodness one all right and two we empty nothing so i am armed with everything necessary to complete a massive cereal challenge in my comfy pajamas i realized the irony of it saying never sleep but yeah i have comfy pajamas a spoon bowls of cereal milk and a timer because it's youtube so without talking too much again please check out molly skyler and dan kennedy's versions of this challenge this is going to be crazy this is the most food i'll have ever consumed in a challenge ever if i can successfully do this i'm trying to be confident but wow anyways we have decided that the time starts once the milk pours so you can't soggify the cereal so we are going to go ahead and pop the tops on these milk so that you can see that everything is not tampered with let's pop the tops start pouring some milk with the timer started okay the cap is still on see the seal is on yes i'm using almond milk so let's pop this tab and this tab all right all right now there's nothing to it but to do it so let's start pouring some milk you'll be hearing from future me this is time to shut up and eat my favorite childhood cereal let's do it milk milk boom molly and dan have already completed this and they said it was hard so okay that's what we're starting with for now starting with the small bowls get them out of the way here we go uh here's where i started to get kind of an inclination that things were kind of taking a turn for the worse unfortunately i started to feel a little bit odd in the tummy it was not a pleasant feeling and i actually ended up chatting a bit with dan killer kennedy and he mentioned that the cold milk could have kind of had an effect on my stomach capacity and that might be why i started to feel a little bit weird sooner than expected yeah ouch ugh oh this is feeling really tight already that's bad so i just tried to go as quick as i could kind of get over the mental hurdle of it most food challenges are all mental so i just pushed pushed and pushed ah come on i don't know this one's making me feel some type of way already come on if i run away you'll know what's happening yeah so at that point i knew my stomach was turning doing some flips and uh i was ready for something bad but in all fairness to myself this is the quickest i have eaten this much food i was not used to trying this before in the past but i'm gonna leave you there and let you witness the rest of the catastrophe in an uncomfortable silence [Applause] uh well that was unexpected uh i'm really sorry about that y'all um yeah i kind of felt funny like right away almost into this i shouldn't say right away like halfway through this and um i guess it happens sorry i've never done that on my channel before yeah obviously that wasn't ideal yeah i ended up actually i went and weighed what i have left here and i have about two and a half pounds left in this bowl that's including milk and cereal so that means i made it through nine and a half pounds which i'm pretty happy with obviously i wish i could have finished this and not felt so funky right away but anyways 12 pounds is a lot of food so i guess it is what it is and if it doesn't challenge you it doesn't change you so anyways if there are any other cereal challenges you would like to see me give a shot let me know maybe i would just have to use a little less milk or maybe i just need to get better so i can handle more but let me know your favorite kind of cereal down below or what sort of cereal chops you would like to see next so that i can redeem myself again a big thank you to molly and dan who i'm sure finished this challenge with no problems and probably did it in a crazy good amount of time again i made it to about nine and a half pounds so i'm okay with that i suppose but there's still a lot of room for improvement so yep if you guys liked this video liked my attempt like me pushing myself please hit that like button if you haven't already join the kilo crew and thank you guys so much for watching and until the next video", "kU_bTwnmFP4": "hey everyone joey here from respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we too review today i've got one of the most popular edible companies in all of california tko tko for those of you that don't know stands for total knockout so for me 10 milligrams is usually just enough to actually knock me out and put me to sleep so i hope these aren't actual total knockouts uh in the way that they don't actually knock me out but these ones that i've got today are uh actually a favorite of my girlfriends the churro crispies so i wanted to go ahead and get these and put them to the test she eats these all the time i occasionally take some bites i may eat a couple here and there but we're going to actually rate and review them today on the churro we've got this beautiful packaging it stands out on the shelf all their different uh items that they sell the brownies the cookies uh the actual fruity rice krispies they all have different packaging so it's visibly super attractive um this actually has 98.7 milligrams in the whole bag um 9.87 milligrams of serving so what's weird about things is that and sometimes with edibles what people don't know is in in the state that it's up to 100 milligrams is the legal limit but all of the items don't actually have to have 10 milligrams per edible or 5 milligrams or 2.5 like they can all vary they can only just go up to 10 or 100 in a bag depending on you know how they were created so for this one 9.87 milligrams per crispy 98.7 milligrams for the whole bag the last bag that she bought recently actually had more than 100 milligrams in it so you guys can see kind of some of the variation there uh i believe it had 102 milligrams of thc in the last bag we bought whereas this is almost two milligrams shy of that on the back nutrition fact-wise they do have this cool little thing here like most food products um calories 62 there's 14.2 grams in here serving size there's 10 servings per container total fat 8.7 grams sodium 33 milligrams carbohydrates 13 grams sugars 9.3 grams and then i always like to go over the ingredients in edibles i think this is super important in today's society a lot of people are allergic to things and you know dating back to when i was a bud tender i really don't remember very many consumers coming in to ask me you know what the ingredients were and knowing out there just how you know there are a ton of people with allergies and stuff super important to know what products are made of so if you're a bud tender learn always read the ingredients on everything on this ingredient wise we're looking at marshmallows which are corn syrup sugar modified food starch corn gelatin water dextrose natural and artificial flavor tetra sodium pyrophosphate and then we've got puffed rice cereal which is rice sugar corn syrup and salt coconut oil unsalted butter granulated sugar cinnamon and thc distillate so this is a distillate edible product manufactured by tko products tko products.com for their website they got the warning label and that's really about it perforated edge shout out to them i don't have to use my teeth look at that and on both sides that one works there we go they've got the metric tag for me to scan it and voila oh my gosh the smell is incredible you guys can see in the bag there a bunch of little rice krispies here let me hold it right side up for y'all a bunch of little rice krispies in there so good so sweet can smell the butter can smell the cinnamon that smells so good okay one bite talk about it two bites score out of ten you guys know what's [ __ ] good ready to go so you guys know those little individually wrapped rice krispie treats that you know we used to get in elementary school those were addictive for a period of time the crunch the sweetness the texture the rice krispies all those things these are better than that the reason why they're better than that is they've got the addition of the cinnamon the cinnamon really brings out the churro flavor that they're going for but it also adds this little bit of like texture not necessarily grittiness but a little bit of texture to the rice krispie treat i don't know if it's because these are slightly doughy or i guess they're not doughy they're marshmallowy but i really feel like this is arguably the best rice krispie treat i've ever eaten and i know that's a huge statement obviously i'm an adult now so i'm not sitting here eating rice krispies treats all the time but when i think about my memories as a kid i always go back to the quantity that i've eaten and the best one i've ever eaten and this with the cinnamon on it way better two bites review out of ten so on the second on the second bite i didn't you don't lose any flavor it still tastes just as good as the first time i'm over here thinking about what what could make this experience better and overall i think when i think of edible companies and i think of how big this packaging is all i can really think of is how to maximize the real estate on this and so when it comes to edibles although this is already in final form i just find that companies that make food when they put recipes on the back it just ends up being much more engaging the more you can keep me hooked into your brand the more likely i am to buy it when with that said a score out of 10 i think i can really give these a 9.5 out of 10 and i have two reasons reason number one is what i just said i'd like to see more of this space utilized the way traditional companies in the regular world with regular world foods are using this stuff fun games information recipes etc i already see cannabis companies doing this specifically cookies cookies companies not the actual cookies company from burner but other cookies companies i've seen them utilize that with recipes making it home etc so i think that's to me that's a 0.25 right there and the other issue i have is inconsistency on the testing i do find i do understand that it is hard to be consistent but when you think about literally two three days ago we bought a bag of these from a different store it has 102 milligrams on it and this one that is listed at 98.7 milligrams and i'm paying the same price i just find that issue to be a little bit concerning you go to most stores you get the same thing every single time i understand it's a food but that's where we can continue to improve so consistency consistency consistency still one of the best products the taste the flavors immaculate the presentation would absolutely recommend 10 out of 10 across the board for every little thing except for i need some more information or a little bit of a guide uh and then i also need this to become consistent on the potency so i appreciate you guys for all the love vaping here coming at you guys respect my region west coast we tour talk some [ __ ] in the comments support be positive do it all whatever you need to do just make sure you guys follow respectmyregion.us on instagram and please please please go subscribe to us on youtube trying to really

"i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "3xi5DazwqMY": "[Music] well hello there guys girls non-binary people it's your favorite unsalted crackers brother reed here yet again and people with us today as always we're joining back by our sidekick you guys know him as the box we also have with us today we have alexa when was ben and jerry's founded ben and jerry was founded on may 5th 1978 by ben cohen and jerry greenfield it is 42 years old 42 years old anyway guys as always it looks like it's that time it's time for other exciting insane super official thought-provoking straight edge food product reviews youtube's only true there's if i don't everybody where ben and jerry's punchline ice cream limited batch it says people it's got brown butter bourbon almonds uh chuckles of cherries chuckles of cherries so this is a netflix netflix taco takes on comedy as sears as we tight as we take making ice cream but neither of us takes ourselves too serious here's a punchy flavor to prove it we recommend pairing this lickable libation with any netflix stand-up special sitcom or funny movie netflix is a joke but this limited batch flavor isn't anyway guys we're gonna give this a review and see what it's all about so remember if you have anything you'd like read the box arch your legs review you gotta leave a comment below if we like that comment guys we might just pick it out and review your request next thumbnail looking forward to this limited batch of ben and jerry's ice cream all righty guys now i picked this up at kroger for three bucks so let's open it up here if it's not child proof that is it may be child proof it may be read proof i guess you could say and that's some good plastic i'm glad they really seal it up like that that's a good thing most people's not going to be eating this in their car so take it home and get you a knife and tire into it you know so there we go we got it that's good good sturdy package very impressed there from ben and jerry's let's see man oh it looks just like vanilla ice cream a little bit there as you can see nothing special it doesn't look like anything special does it let's get down into it here and see what we've got okay okay wow wow it's almost like they have the nuts very finely cut up inside of the ice cream [Music] they do that's clever isn't it very clever there's uh very finely the nuts are very finely inside of the ice cream very finely chopped up it's not like a big like a big almond it's very finely chopped up i like that very clever from netflix and ben and jerry's punch line flavor so this is probably gonna be a limited batch like they said it's not gonna be out long so i've always figured i've always seen ben and jerry's is a little bit overrated anyway people i think they're while they're good you know they're there's a little bit of cherry right there let's try this here it's like the cherries mixed inside of the ice cream you really can barley you can barely see it people you have to really look so they've done a great job people i was expecting to have like big size uh cherries in it and big peanuts but they've done a great job just you know chopping it up and mixing it right in the ice cream very nice very evenly done no doubt about that definitely a lot better than i expected people so overall people it's great flavor got the brown butter bourbon you can taste it the almonds are great it's good a little bit of cherries in it it's good ice cream it really is and i just said it was overrated well i think they're a little bit upready but it's good to see a company with just two people in it start a company and just do great at it so overall people i highly recommend it you can see the nuts if you look see the nuts all around it there it's pretty neat but overall people i'm going to give it a very solid is that a cherry right there you can see oh no what is that look at that people would that be a cherry i guess that would be yeah anyway people overall i'm going to give it a very solid score you know there really isn't any bad the only bad ice cream i would say that i've had people is ice cream that's out of date it's hard to find bad ice cream it really is so overall people ben and jerry's punch line ice cream vermont's finest is gonna get a very solid score of four stars it's good it's good so that's going to be the official review people as always thank you so much for watching me the box archie alexa we'll see you guys as always next time man that i was just i

Actors Guild Foundation. I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending. Thank you.", "FEkVu4TTi7I": "all right buddy I'm Johnny school I have issues this is chase to eat as a special chase he for a couple reasons I'll explain this in a second hello everybody joining in I

Facebook I wanna thank you guys for joining me I'm Johnny Scoville we broke a record a Swiss chase the heat", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and

here today this meditation is designed to help you release the anxiety and responsibility that follows each of us from our waking lives to our dreaming lives it is a chance for you to let go for a little while and just be following your body's natural rhythms as you sink into a profound and healing sense of calm to get the most out of this meditation create a quiet safe place for yourself let your bedroom become a soothing tranquil haven guiding and protecting you as your journey inwards before we begin take a moment to eliminate every possible distraction you are able to pull the blinds silence your cell phone tell your family members to turn down the TV in the next room take a moment to tend to your own needs and bring an intention for this time into your mind and heart these are not mandatory instructions but I believe they will enhance your practice immeasurably when you and your space are ready find the comfortable position ideally lying down on your bed or another soft flat surface arrange your pillows line up your blankets just right and slowly let your eyes drift shut if you can it may not feel natural to close your eyes right now but do not worry this is perfectly normal you are reaching the close of a busy day all night and your brain is just now getting accustomed to the idea that it might be time to rest for a while so do not try to force your eyes to stay shut if they do not want to but giving your muscles permission to let go Safin become pliable with every moment that passes you will find yourself relaxing more easily and more completely carried deeper into serenity by the sounds of this meditation let go of your expectations and give yourself over to the sensations that appear in your body and mind your attention might be fluttering around right now busy with thoughts about what happened today what you would like in the future what you still need to accomplish this is okay your brain is your personal assistant reminding you of appointments keeping you on track and sometimes even giving you a scolding but every personal assistant needs a break including your brain begin to call your attention away from the details from today and focus on your breathing or your heartbeat are the words of this meditation feel your muscles start to relax maybe just a little bit or maybe all at once notice the way the pillows cradle your head the way the blankets around hold your body's warmth close to you you are safe here beginning a journey towards total peace and relaxation there is no need to rush or slow down whatever pace you choose is exactly the right one let yourself breathe feel the pressure as you inhale the silence at the end of your exhale if thoughts pop back into your consciousness imagine blowing them away like dandelion fluff if letting go of your thoughts seems difficult or scary do not worry everyone's conscious mind wants to keep running solving puzzles optimizing every aspect of your life but nothing can run at 100% all the time and in fact trying to force yourself to be productive responsible or intelligent all the time always backfires in the long run give yourself permission to let go just why you listen to this meditation and open yourself to creativity inspiration and rejuvenation as you grow more relaxed start to become familiar with the way your body feels at this moment in time do not let your mind fool yourself into thinking how your body feels but instead let your muscles your bones your skin show you how you feel tense worried maybe frightened whatever you experience at this very moment is perfectly fine you do not need to judge any of the sensations that arise in your body or mind instead welcome them in offer them a space to relax to communicate with you you are beginning to notice your whole self all at once without judgment this is a profound and transformative and outlook one that will enable you to make any decision you need to including the one that matters most at this very moment with your next inhale breathe in relaxation and when you exhale breathe out everything you are holding on to breathe in and give yourself permission to rest to let go completely you are becoming more attuned to your breath and your whole body begin to focus this awareness on your feet and angles noticing any tendons that feel tight and muscles that feel tired on your next inhale clench your feet as tight as you can curling your toes up under the soles of your feet making every fiber of your being rigid and now release feel the waves of relaxation that run through your muscles leaving your feet and ankles softer heavier more at peace now turn your attention to your calves knees and thighs tense them as tightly as possible squeezing your muscles as hard as you can and let them go notice the way your body feels progress in a similar way up the rest of your body tightening your stomach your back your fists your shoulders and releasing them feel how this simple action dissolves any tension or pain that may have been hiding in these parts of your body and now scrunch your whole face up eyebrows furrowed lips tight and relaxed notice how smooth your brow is how soft your cheeks and jawbone feel if you would like take a moment to constrict your entire body at once every muscle taut every tendon and ligament flexed and let go breathe in and exhale and again feel your whole body heavy and calm against your mattress and blankets enjoy this feeling of calm and serenity as your body enters a deeper realm of relaxation your mind follows suit however even the most diligent of us may still be noticing a stray thought or worry wandering through our consciousness this is perfectly normal some people spend their entire lives trying to find perfect stillness in meditation you do not have to clear your mind completely in order to experience a deeper relaxation but it does help if you can remove any negative distractions as you sink into rest so allow your mind to reawaken for just a few moments as you call to mind all of the things in your life that you are grateful for let yourself feel the bed underneath you the fluffiness of your pillows feel thankfulness well up in your heart as you appreciate the textures the warmth of the world around you notice the music and sounds of this meditation and let gratitude for everything and everyone who made your experience at this very moment possible you have worked hard to get where you are now but so have others your family and friends who have supported you through good times and bad the people past and present who have mentored you and helped you learn the lessons who have made you who you are even the people who make your life better on a daily basis without you having to be conscious of it the people who keep the roads and sidewalks in good repair the employees who make sure the food you need is available to you when you go to buy it even the designers who created a possession new treasure or rely on let yourself open to the infinite connections we share with the people around us and if you would like take a moment to say a silent thank you realize to that you are connected with the natural world it does not matter if you live in a bustling metropolis or a cabin in the heart of the woods you yourself are a part of nature just as much as any other organism the grass that grows in the cracks of the sidewalk the rabbits that bound across lush fields the hawk that rides a current of warm air hundreds of feet above you they too live under the sun the moon the stars like you they are made from the same elemental building blocks that comprise all matter on earth the same hydrogen carbon oxygen feel your kinship with them the solidarity you share as creatures of Earth realize that you can never truly be alone for every moment of every day you are surrounded by organisms who both touch your life and are touched by your presence you are a part of the beauty of life we have arrived here at a relaxation deeper sweeter then you may have ever experienced before let it permeate you heal you transform you feel this profound peace in your bones your muscles your organs your skin it envelops you soothing any pain or discomfort you may have felt in the past or feel now as you are infused by serenity and total calm you can sense millions of opportunities presenting themselves to you all equally pleasant or universally good you can choose to stay in this place feeling your breath and the physical presence of your own body and mind or you can venture further exploring your own subconscious perhaps there is a place you have always longed to visit or a figure you seek guidance from if this is the case allow a scenario to expand in your mind's eye appearing gently effortlessly until you are aware of vivid details and your own sense of tranquillity nothing that can appear here will hurt you you are safe imagine that this scenario in front of you is like a warm lake inviting you in in your mind's eye you approach it dip your toe in and allow your whole body and mind to sink into the world of your imagination in this space anything is possible and everything is safe your imagination is the limit if you want you can fly over an ancient city or entertain an influential figure from your own personal history for dinner anything that feels forced or unpleasant simply falls away as you continue to breathe feeling your body in mind even as you sink deeper into your imaginary world let yourself go completely melting into the sights sounds and smells of the world around you you are completely in control gentle and intentional as you let yourself explore more fully the depths of relaxation you you feel the changes in your body in mind after only a few short minutes of relaxation you are karma rich with wisdom and peace whatever happens next is up to you at this time we have reached the end of the spoken portion of this meditation but now you are free if you would like you can gently wake your body up calmly with awareness otherwise let yourself sink or deeply into relaxation and join the softness of your bed and the sounds of the music around you feel how loose your muscles are how still your mind is let yourself just be as you drift deeper and deeper into the heart of relaxation contemplation and peace enjoy every moment of it you you you you you", "Lgj6Vd4i5I0": "hello guys and welcome back to the channel sorry that I've missed a few days I've had a lot going on with work and live streaming and changing my office around and stuff but I have another review for you today that I'm actually really excited for you've more than likely heard of this product to by a fellow youtuber named ripped rippers I've heard a lot of hype about his ejuice called rainbow nuggets looper honestly I've went through three bottles of this in the past month and a half this has probably become one of my absolute favorite juices so far so as I was researching that is like a Froot Loops flavor so as I was researching I decided you know what I want something else my favorite cereal is pretty pebbles so I thought I've been watching rivers for a while and he keeps talking about this fruity pebbles flavor with a scoop of ice cream on top and I was like that is perfect for me so I thought I'd try it out so I ordered a bottle and this is it right there says rainbow nuggets has Tripps face right there so this is his personal brand he calls it spotlight I've got this in three milligrams I believe it comes in zero three six and maybe even nine this is the hundred and twenty ml bottle you can get it in smaller doses but this right here with tax and to have it shipped to me was shipping and everything came out to about $30 so I mean I've paid $30 for bottles this size that I did not enjoy and then I was so stuck with it so I was a little hesitant on ordering this because I was like I really like looper and watching some other reviews on rainbow nuggets a lot of people compare it to looper so I was like I feel kind of safe with this because if I don't like it it's at least kind of close to Luber and I can fight through it but I wanted to do this right so I'm going to be testing it out here this is the drop dead RDA I've got new cotton and stuff in here as well on my Nova kit I've noticed with this tank I don't know what they're doing with the coils a little differently but some flavors I don't like I end up liking in this and as well as my absolute favorite which is right there is Betty which I love and like the free max tanks I actually don't like it in this tank so I'm gonna test it out in this RDA and this sub ohm tank to kind of see both sides of the spectrum of am I gonna like it very much so yeah guys I've already got this pre filled on both so I'm gonna test them out and tell you what I think about it so first we're gonna try on the drop dead and this is rainbow nuggets pie troopers okay okay I want to test it out on this first before I give my initial reaction so here it is with the Novikov got it on 70 watts right now that seems to be my preferred with this coil so I'm gonna test it out on the air goodness I've been using this Novick it a lot here lately um my favorite up into this point was the drag from booboo but I think this might have replaced it I will not be getting rid of my drag I absolutely love it but every time I reach for a vape I seem to be reaching for this one for some strange reason but I've really enjoyed this one so far okay right off the bat um it does not taste like looper I'm gonna go ahead and put that out there but this is the closest you can actually get to Froot Loops I believe out of any eliquid that you're gonna buy on the market this does not taste like fruit loops and it does not claim to taste like fruit loops but a lot of reviewers are comparing this to looper and saying that it tastes like fruit loops I do not believe that it tastes like fruit loops at all um right off the bat I really get the strong cream like the ice cream on top and it's hard to say if it tastes like fruity pebbles it definitely has a rainbow taste I know that that's very confusing it doesn't make a lot of sense but I think that rainbow taste is kinda where people are saying okay this is you know fruity pebbles and I would see that it does taste like fruity pebbles because pretty pebbles has a lot of different flavors in there but a few other people try this and they said that it tastes like lemon I've also heard that with fruity pebbles I've had a lot of people say that their problem with fruity pebbles is that it just tastes like lemon and milk so I think he hit the nail on the head with this one because this right here to me does taste like fruity pebbles it does taste like pretty pebbles in the ice cream for $30 that's a good sized bottle I like the packaging it's it's got a lot going on like in the background there's a lot of pink back in there and you can't really tell what that is maybe it's cotton candy or something no I know he's went through a few different phases right there I believe one that I saw had like an actual bowl and it had ice cream and fruity pebbles in the bowl and I think that's probably my favorite artwork that I've seen on here but they got the face they got the face now let's see if I can change look at that that face is down pet that is ripped rippers so rip I gotta say you did a fantastic job on this e-liquid a huge fan will definitely be vaping through this whole bottle and probably ordering another one pretty soon I do gotta say though this is on his website it's of a trick calm please go check it out if you want some of this um my go ahead and warn you this is very hard to get ahold of I've been wanting to order some of this for about three months now and every time I go on the website they are sold out so this is definitely a huge seller for trip and I would definitely recommend this I would not say it's a replacement for looper I would not even say that it tastes like looper it really doesn't it's in that same cereal category but it's it's not the same this is its own beast it really is I really wish that my vape shop in town started telling this you guys you can't get on this oh so it doesn't say on the packaging but if I had to guess this is probably a 70/30 blend you might be able to get in different blends but I'm pretty sure that's what this is for four ounces for thirty bucks that's a steal I think that he could charge a little bit more for this and yeah Tripp good job keep it up I think that this is for the vapor that is looking for a cereal flavor I would push you definitely in the direction of either looper or rainbow nuggets please do support your creators on YouTube that you follow like ripped rippers so yeah guys to finish up if you're looking for a cereal flavor this is by far one of the best cereal flavors on the market I would put it right up there next to looper which currently held the number one spot for cereal flavors for me personally all this is gonna be personal discretion but uh yeah if you're looking for a fruity pebbles and ice cream vape definitely check out ripped rippers it was a trick calm I'm a huge fan will definitely be getting more and probably running through this bottle pretty quick but once again it is hard to get a hold of like I said I've been trying for three months and could not get a bottle so now that I do have one I'm thinking about going ahead and ordering another one just to have it on the way because they sell out really quickly but thanks for coming along guys sorry this is a little shorter but uh think about checking this ejuice out at very calm and keep it up rip", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "kGoQovjQWZ8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about one of my favorite brands again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again

let's stop but then I had to go pick up my daughter and I was a [ __ ] but these people were so nice it blows it to me I felt so freaking guilty anyway when you're in the waiting room they have a big board up TV screen that tells you all everything that's available in the price and that was really helpful especially when I was panicking so we could decide what we wanted fast and get in and out and these people were so kind and helpful like I was obviously panicked like because I had to be somewhere and so we told her what we wanted and she went back and got it all ready for us so when we finally finished processing our paperwork we were able to run back there grab the stuff and then like be mesmerized because there's all this stuff to look at they had like a little glass display cases where you can look at things and all this glass work to look at and I don't even know what else because I was like both focused but like I wanted to spend time there like I wanted to go there and spend an hour looking at everything they had and I felt good it felt like a really good beautiful place to hang out and be educated and talk about what they have also I wanted to tell you they told us that on weed maps is automatically linked to their inventory so you could see exactly what they do have at that time before you go and let's see let's get to the hole oh my god okay so this is Blue

always everything is freakin childproof really crazy and you pick it up and this let's get some and it's a pale yellow there you go and it smells like alcohol hey that's what we got so there's number

hello there hello hello to you my name is amateur vapor and you guessed it I am still an amateur vapor and I'll give a crap welcome to Friday so excited it's Friday it is payday yeah and I'm so proud of myself because it's payday and usually I'm like oh my god I might go by myself me clothes I'm gonna go buy myself something and I didn't so I'm super excited about that another thing I'm really excited about is my boys just left and they are going to NXT wrestling tonight so I'm so happy that they're able to spend that time together and they're gonna have such a blast I haven't taken my youngest one he's now 14 I haven't taken him to wrestling in several years so he's really really gonna love this so I can't wait til they get home to find out the fun that they had and while they're gone I'm gonna have a little fun myself so without further ado I'm gonna get to this juice review really quick for you today because I've got to leave in 30 minutes showing them by my friend's house before my meeting so without further ado the juice review that I'm going to do for you today is another fantastic one from glass this is strawberry blast hello oh oh hello sweet strawberry blast yes the basic series if you've ever tried glass basic series there isn't one that's nasty they're all good and here's the box hello oh yes the classic classic box from glass all righty let's read a little bit about this a classic take on strawberry sour belts with a gummy bear twist that will blow your taste buds away sweet and sour or sour and sweet either way your mouth will be watering from or yes without further ado I'm gonna take a couple puffs for you and for me here we go YUM I'm gonna take another puff here we go yes now on the inhale I taste strawberry and I taste a fruity strawberry it's not a candy strawberry to me what I taste is a very fresh ripe strawberry a little on the dark side as I'm inhaling just for a moment I taste sour and as I blow it out I taste the strawberry again and then that little smack I taste the sour again and it goes into a berry flavor it tastes like strawberry but it doesn't taste like the beginning type of the strawberry it tastes more maybe it's more of a candy strawberry alrighty at the end let me try it again here we go ooh do you hear me smack that was that little bit of sour that I tasted there once again on that inhale I taste strawberry and the strawberry is a dark very dark strawberry it's not one of those ones where you taste it and you're just like oh you know it's kind of like a dark berry strawberry taste just for a moment when I'm done inhaling that little pop of sour and it's not too sour I kind of would like it to be a little bit more sour on the end when I blow it out I taste the berry again and then I taste a little deeper sour and I like that deeper sour at the end I really wish I would taste it a little bit even deeper than I do on the inhale as well as on the exhale because when I do taste that sour the sour is fresh it just for me needs to be a little bit more I'm gonna try to do some vapor ins for you really quick my fan is off so if I suck I just suck here we go mmm that was that I tasted it at the end again not too good not too bad on the vapor ings definitely has wonderful clouds 70/30 is the VG PG on this for a 60 milliliter bottle if you look online you're gonna get it as low as about 1199 if you go to glass site you're gonna get it for about 16 95 would I recommend it absolutely I would recommend it if you're not into sour sour like a sour belt and you do like the straight-up strawberry this is a fantastic juice I would give it 5 out of 5 would I buy it again and the answer is no because I like a little bit more sourish type stuff to me if you don't like really sour or anything and I like the really sour stuff you're gonna like it because the berry is very very flavorful and it's very full and it's very very delicious it is not a coil killer for me as well just so that you're aware of that when it comes to glass I'm going to say one thing they for me are probably one of a couple of companies that are just straight-out always good you never run into anything that is bad at all I loved their badge line unfortunately they recently stopped their badge line I hope they bring it back again I loved the pound cake on that I loved the guava I really really liked that those are flavors that I would buy again and I hear that they've been discontinued so that makes me a little sad but once again and this is strawberry blast y'all so oh hello hello hello hello I give up it is not just focusing fantastic juice my name is Michelle Viper if you like my video in any way gimme a like hit subscribe hit that Bell button I upload juice reviews every Friday for Rai yay and I have a whole bunch I have to do and like I have to start doing them soon because my bottles are getting low so maybe I'll do some more this weekend maybe not I don't know but have a fantastic safe and wonderful

confections these are the chocolate covered blueberries i got them at new era dispensary down the street on north avenue in chicago check them out for you know your next your next run um but these actually these costs about 40 20 of these come in the 10 and they're 5 milligrams of thc each we're going to give it a taste and come back and see what effect it has so first glances here you can see that all the chocolate covered blueberries are in there um not a bad size not a bad size you know i'm looking for something that tastes good right but um [Music] we're gonna we're gonna see how this goes so let's let's give it a taste [Music] so first initial thoughts really chocolatey um nice and soft too um really good blueberry field blueberry sorry can you top really good blueberry taste as well um overall one of the top tasting edibles i've had and i've had a lot of edibles recently with it being legal in chicagoland area so not bad not bad um so we're gonna wait about an hour and come back and and see how i feel um because you know sometimes i've had 5 milligrams of thc you know i'm gone and then other times i can't feel things so we're going to see how i feel when we get back what's up guys so it's been about 55 minutes since we've taken the five milligram thc edible now again i i take it about i take i take edibles you know almost every day so it's different effect on me depending on the day it's been a while since i've had an edible but yeah this is giving me pretty high feeling it's uh it's hard to explain obviously but uh yeah good a good effect i would definitely recommend uh this is and now i'm gonna go watch some some movies or something but yeah take care", "y3BWk53aCqE": "[Music] what's going on dickweeds Oh [ __ ] right are you excited yeah why our grass

some Parmesan cheese some salad with some French salad dressing wash that down with a cold Molson Canadian and that's supper oh my flock off to wash my meat cigarette I'm gonna try one of these [ __ ] thingamabobs that came out of the grass chief order so it'll be broken up because I dropped it on the basement floor okay and you severe hurt you know then it's okay would there's a billion better things for the munchies in this [ __ ] smoking weed and the end of all like dry you know this isn't gonna [ __ ] help anything it's only gonna make matters worse came with two in the pack I'll save the other one for Dona she went to take Charlie for a walk I'm pretty sure she said she was going to what you call it drink one of those hot chocolates the 50 milligrams 50 milligrams of THC usually she only does I think 25 milligrams per night like over edibles at so 50 milligrams let's double what she's used to we'll see what happens Canada Post is working again they're finally [ __ ] moving so I decided today to order up that external piece for the GoPro and [ __ ] Donna found some little microphone on line for me there looks like it'll go nice so order that up too but Canada Post is pretty backed up I bet so I don't know how long it's going to take to get here so yeah yeah okay the water is boiled dollars gonna pour it into the cup which doesn't fly all over the floor do you want any milk or anything okay we'll let that cool down a little bit and then we'll come back to us tastes the weed you mean the THC you teach you can taste the THC in there in just a little bit don't know

the wind starts to kick in [ __ ] you have for that house it asked you how you feel but I already know I think everybody watching those could you were laughing already I wonder what the [ __ ] you're laughing at that's how long you're laughing you were looking over here laughing and I was one yeah the whole time we'll even look at the tape later we're not the tape the video you know people just want to know how you feel after taking that I think they can tell it you're happy if somebody who's having aches and pains and it took that if you having a good maybe having a good old time what you can hurt yourself more sure if your wrist was broken and it wasn't a lot of pain and then you have like a lot and the people away so you start like using your wrist for that's probably not a good thing if you have a broken wrist and you just start using it I think if you had a sore wrist you would know that your wrist had problems [ __ ] you just [ __ ] insect [ __ ] you or something [ __ ] right in view there you wouldn't feel the pain because if it landed on you slapping it off and running it wouldn't get a chance to bite yeah I know how you are edibles make you want to sit and not move around too much the tuna ate I think the guys that smoked it either be going anywhere I think everybody get pretty lazy yeah sit by the [ __ ] tree what tree you're [ __ ] we'll be right back so

medication that can be made with a gelatin or wax base to use your trophies first you'll want to wash your hands with warm soapy water before getting started it comes in a prescription container like this so you'll want to take the prescription cover off and then this plastic packaging to make it a little bit easier to work with you can actually twist and kind of select the packaging to loosen it and one side comes with the lid so you can open that lid up and then you'll see that they're pretty easy to separate and if you want to make make it a little bit easier you can flip it and kind of push one out so that would be one method of dispensing and you can see that's easily flexing out or you can flip it back around and then kind of play around with the pieces until you get them out but they should easily kind of separate once you play around with ink come out as a clean piece if the doctor prescribed less than a full trophy it is scored and easy to cut with a knife in 2/4 or 1/2 if needed the trophy should be used as directed by your physician it can be placed either between the teeth and the gums the side of your teeth or under the tongue allow it to fully dissolve for complete absorption of the medication this can take up to fifteen to thirty minutes the goal is to have the medication enter your system through the oral mucosal membrane layer through your skin rather than being swallowed do not eat drink or brush your teeth for 30 minutes after using the medication it is best practice to rotate the location where you place the troche to prevent any irritation these medications can be sweetened or flavored upon request due to the sweetness or flavor of this medication be sure to keep it out of reach from children most trophies do not need to be kept refrigerated they can be stored in a cool dry location or at room temperature do not leave them in your car in direct sunlight or warm places because they can melt if you have any further questions feel free to

show you how to make my locally world-famous tricks marshmallow treats what you're gonna need is one bag of marshmallows today I happen to be using strawberry marshmallows you can use the big ones or the small it's the same amount in the packaging it's about 10 ounces and both and you're melting them down completely so it really doesn't matter whether you get the big ones or the small ones I have 100 grams of marijuana butter a big not big nonstick pan a wooden spoon or any type of spoon really a box of tricks you can either use tricks or generic tricks it doesn't matter they I finally tastes the same this is just what I Cap'n to get at the store today and then I get a cupcake tin because this helps me to portion them into twelve servings you could actually portion my edibles into 24 and eat one or I pushing them into twelve and I'll eat half of one okay first what you don't want to do is I actually like to start off by putting a little bit of margarine or butter or a little tiny bit of oil in the bottom of the pan because you're gonna be putting the marshmallows in without any butter in addition to it and that just helps it stop them from sticking to the bottom of the pan [Music] you know what I'm gonna do is I'm going to let these start to get soft a little bit and in about two minutes I'm going to add my butter to it now that the marshmallows have started to get sticky and gooey as you can see what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my butter and just pour it right in [Music] basically gonna want to keep stirring this make sure it's on the really low heat is the last thing you want to do is turn this it's gonna take about five more minutes until it completely becomes a pace at which time is when you will add whatever type of cereal you like to put in this sometimes they use tricks sometimes I use Coco Krispies sometimes I use Apple Jacks sometimes I use just regular Rice Krispies Fruity Pebbles cocoa pebbles they all make really really really good sweet edibles I'll bring this back and it's completely turned into a face the whole process to make these is no more than 50 minutes now that the marshmallows have been cooking for that's been almost five minutes it completely turns into the pace at which time you're gonna want to turn the heat off move it over a burner because the less heat you have the better it is and then you just take a whole box of cereal and boardin pretty simple to be honest you get the picture take it from the pan after you give a good stir making sure it's fairly mixed Trix tends to give you pretty good sized treats good size 12 good sized treats which is really what I like to use these tins just to help accurately make them all about the same size of course you're gonna make sure you want to wash your hands thoroughly before you do this always be safe I'm gonna make 12 treats about that size which time I'll show you when they're all done and while your end result takes about 15 maybe 20 minutes at the most don't they look awesome thanks a lot for watching my videos you guys have a good one", "ohxDUez4AoI": "real quick before this video starts only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "462zIfmmZIo": "[Music] well no eat skies we are talking t K o edibles again today this is the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "GlNRlD6udeA": "the heist but he's back he's back after an hour yes yes guys he's back he's back are you doing are you doing so roughly an hour late it's being literally about an hour and three minutes day but feel the effects I feel the effects very very nicely actually it feels lovely it's not overpowering or anything like that I really really enjoy it it's nice I don't think the 300 milligram sweets were quite enough for me I have quite a high tolerance to cannabis as you guys know you've seen more smoke but yeah you really really feel a nice effect from this like I said it's not overpowering I don't want to sort of - don't mean I'm not gonna sort of an uncomfortable position or place or anything like that I just feel really nice I feel good I feel like I put some games on I feel like I've got I'd be fighting for a walk I could be absolutely active scrappy-dappy-doo being stop it nor pussycat but yeah I feel I feel really good I feel really really nice on her I don't feel salt down all over or anything like that lovely I'm not see it's only it's only just being just over an hour and it does say quite clearly on the packet may take up two hours so delay by up to two hours okay so I'm probably not in the full of the effects as of yet anyway so it's probably a little bit more time I would say I think I'm just on a gradual buildup in a minute but I would say that after about half an hour I started to feel something which like so I didn't on the other packet of sweets at all I didn't it took like the full hour before I started getting the effects of it so it works a lot quicker but I'd probably put that down to me doing it first thing in the morning I'm not having anything to eat as of yet so so for me personally if I do have any of these sweets again I'm going to try my best to probably take them first thing privy inside you and I mean unless I've got loads of em and then I'll just wash them like anything but yeah if you just use them as medicine then yeah I think first thing in the morning for me works the and I'll be interested to see actually how long it lasts as well so be out feeling nice and feeling nice and I'm nice and relaxed nice and mellow nicely stoned in my body yeah just like not overpowering my vision feels a little bit like it's going a little bad times when I move my head's so definite strength to it but I personally think that I could eat a couple of packets of those no problem and it would be OK for me to do that I would recommend you guys do that obviously if you don't smoke a lot just you know mean they'd split up into 50 milligram pieces so it's really really good to go shoo just because I've taking a whole pot don't go do that please you know me know your body know your limits but for me it not problem been smoking quite a lot of years to be fair my tolerance is up there so but I think of ninja had taken for example that packet of sweets I think she'd be really really feeling it bang so a tolerance a little bit lower than mine Oh see I am the main smoker cheers guys so still on the black cheese loving it though does it make me feel like I want to stop smoking which is which is good although sometimes about as it was it's like I can't touch the smoke for hours but now I feel a right of your eye not a particularly high dosage for me but gets really good guys [Music] you're quite chatty as well I'm always chatting you know that my job really over chat in a minute nice pecked on me I've had a bomb since the last bomb over so again it's been an hour since all that bomb definitely like to try some more of these better bores I [Music] definitely like to probably get to a position where I can maybe have a couple of packs of em and see what they feel like but left me for me I've still got half of my speaker left which is just oh no I think I only have one mil of it or whatever it is but there's about half of it left night so starving hungry I'm gonna make a famous Ryan fecal pizza okay I will save a little drop of it just for the for the fecal hot chocolate cause I didn't want to do a thick hot chocolate as well but I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna do a pizza with some Pico on it which is what like so Ryan eats it and he recommends it and I thought well do you know what that sounds really good last time I got it all over my teeth I've tried it in there's other ways you can do it as well but I think that defeats the way I really really really like the idea of that so I will try that I will try that definitely so I've seen a few people do the Pico pizza so yeah it's made me think hmm lot lot easier way to go down and a lot sort of safer in your body because you're digesting it with food at the same time lovely a little bomb well I'm a rocket oh dear cheers guys Cheers yeah I feel it [ __ ] lovely I feeling lovely nice they like say it might affect you differently if you take a packet about if you're like a one joint add a person and you know you you're not make particularly a heavy heavy smoker maybe you're not a smoker at all maybe that's the reason why you'll you know you're taking metaphors is because you don't like smoking so I would just say start with a low dosage and then just just build yourself up after an hour you'll get to feel whether you're comfortable or not and then obviously you can you can take another dose and so yeah don't do a packet in one go please please guys one love I'm fashioning I've been trained for this [Music] lovely Peter [ __ ] noise noise a cocktail - Peter [ __ ] lovely [Music] become picture here we come you'll be on the live stream do their life garibai straight after this pretty much as soon as the pizza sketch [Music] Wow what can you say to that cheers guys cups tea on the go you know how we roll in the am one huh let me feel really good I mean ready if I was gonna rip you know give him a proper sort of a review is sort of mark then I mean Oxley the pack her packaging tell accent the sweets himself really really really nice I like the fact that you can dose by having the eight sweets which are basically fifty milligrams of peace they sell I think that's brilliant really really nice really really nice of fat not quite strong enough for me but for some people that might be really really strong so yeah probably set by an eight out of ten on though so a ten on sweets by would like soy two packets will certainly see what the sweets and the feet can do together with the black cheese you will see what sort of stately and getting me into today though shall they so yeah peaceful nerve thank you very much for watching this video and I will be back very very soon because I'm gonna be doing a live stream in the next 20 minutes so peace will learn

me to review their basics line and this is Caribbean punch and according to the box and the label this has flavor notes of peach strawberry apple and pineapple has four out of five vapor production five out of five flavor strengths and two out of five throw hit and this is a 70/30 VG PG e juice and they describe it as a blend of succulent peach mouth-watering pineapple sweet strawberry refreshing apples and a hint of apricot you can get it in 60 ml bottles for 1695 and nicotine strengths of zero three and six it smells like it has a little peach but it smells much more exotic like it might have glava in it I can sort of get that smell of strawberry - so I'm vaping this on the smoke Pro color at 97 watts with the goon 1.5 already a on top built at point 27 ohms the label rates at a throw hit of two out of five but it doesn't really have a throw hit at all to me this is a hard one for me it's very fruity and very sweet and like to smell it taste like exotic fruits and even though guava isn't an ingredient listed on the label it kind of has the F aftertaste of guava I think that flavors come in from the mix of strawberry and pineapple the strawberry isn't a fresh strawberry but more like a strawberry hard candy so the combination of those two flavors gives us a really unique and distinct taste there's a slight hint of peach but it's hard for me to get the apples in this but I can see how Apple might be adding to the flavor here this one is really different it's an interesting flavor combination and because of that I think that this one is going to be a love it or hate it each use for a lot of people I do like it but I also typically like guava and papaya type flavors so if this sounds like something that you'd like you can get Caribbean punch from

multo meals where they die no bikes yeah I know who do you know you got our newbie Dinobots fruity doesn't analyze which sound good dunk oh but this is a flight test so we don't know what we're trying first he's got our own little Bowl here oh I see you soon actions he does not eat it with milk he never eats cereal with no get that I'm saying really chuckling oh okay let's just try it I baked this this one for a long time so I remember which one this is very this very very I understand that however some companies might not oh yes this I mean it's pretty crunchy too like you get really crunchy bites but but how long it's going down about a second the crunchiness okay so maybe it doesn't hold its crunchiness for very long I see look Fruity Pebbles doesn't usually and it's a cereal that I load and then heat a portion at a time so I way they sit on top of there guys yeah then that just last night no I never disturb the top layer right always the last part I eat which thing is it good yeah you like it is this something you would consider eating on a regular basis there yeah he likes to eat still eating loves it so we'll move on to our next one this looks a little more familiar to me I feel like I think this is pretty petals will see them dries I'm milking on this [Music] [Music] neither better [Music] well I'm gonna have leftovers god face wise that wins for sure that's a much better pedal bike thing right Bob will tell you if you refer to earlier in this video he did mother Sarah was really good I thought was pretty enough well yeah it was good it was good good just back to back this one does this one fruitier better-tasting eight I'm sure my favorite so far is the second one based on taste and overall satisfaction so little Tommy which one's better which one did you like better the 180 now so a second one all right so we're gonna flip it over alright so which one is the second one Oh Scooby oh okay maldo field was a matzo meal I don't look at that start gluten-free by the way it says great says on the paper I wouldn't make that out of the truth God the truth someone wrote it in pins on the back okay they're both coming at 598 Boggs 98 cents these are the big bags the fruity pebbles are 36 ouches ouches ow 36 ounces but if your your bedroom at the prestigious ounces Americus a foodie dynabar bites home hill is 40 ounces alright so food bevel 36 40 ounces for malt-o-meal Dino bikes both the same price bug gluten-free second choice the second one we ate was the Dino bites it was much better so it's pretty clear for me matzo meal wins this round

hello hello hello whoa hello to you my name is amateur vapour under yes I am still a total amateur vapor and I still don't give a crap welcome to Friday it is about 5,000 degrees in Arizona and I'm about to die and I'm gonna have to drive in a couple of moments unfortunately so please say a prayer for me that my air conditioning continues to work properly because I've been having problems with it I'm suddenly driving and suddenly it will stop and I cannot deal with that today like seriously and I have to pick somebody up on the way to my meeting today and yeah I just need some good luck throw-in my way so if you are a prayer please say a prayer for me or throw some good luck my way I'd appreciate it welcome to Friday so happy that it's Friday unfortunately I'm not happy that it's the weekend because it's not like I can really do anything but what I am going to do is just chill maybe play some board games with my little boy who's doing very very well in school so right now I feels just super super happy he just got 90 something percent on the test and pretty much has AIDS and all of his grades at the moment so I am stress-free regarding this weekend and having to do homework in all that crap so without further ado I decided I'm going to do a summertime juice for you today and the summertime juice what I'm going to do is Caribbean punch yes hello this is Caribbean punch I love it it is pink and I love the color pink sweet Caribbean punch you know what pink is the thing guys so if you're a guy don't ever feel like you can't pick this up because it's pink because guys that wear pink are cool in my opinion so oh let's show you the box real quick here's the box Caribbean punch it's by glass love glass juicy peach care in punch which I just kind of found that out right now I didn't even know it was called juicy peach so let's read a little bit about it like the intoxicating vibe of the islands it's the perfect blend of succulent peach mouth-watering pineapple sweet strawberry refreshing apples and hint of apricot truly tropical bliss and this one totally is so without further ado I'm gonna take a couple puffs for you here we go [Music] such such such a summertime juice I'm going to take another puff here we go hello hello where are you hey wow look at the cloud reduction on there 70/30 VG PG on this one on the inhale I taste a bit of strawberry now on the exhale I taste different flavors every single time I taste peach I taste pineapple sometimes I taste a little bit of tangy apple I love how this is and sometimes when I take it when I inhale I taste peach but it's not overpowering so if you're someone that really doesn't like peach a lot it just smoothes and blends together just so fresh you definitely have to try this one I'm gonna take another puff here we go [Music] oh yes oh it smells so good in here right now on the inhale that time I tasted peach right when I did the inhale on the exhale I tasted strawberry with a little peach maybe even a tad bit of mango maybe that's the the apricot that I'm tasting and it's leaving kind of a pineapple taste in my mouth at this moment definitely refreshing crisp clean this is not overpowering in any way I really really love this I'm gonna take another puff here we go it's a sweet surprise every single time I take a vape off of this on the inhale on that time I tasted strawberry on the inhale right at the end I tasted a bit of peach on the exhale more of a pineapple with a little bit of strawberry and then topped off with a little bit of I'm not really quite sure to me it tastes like mango but I've never really ate apricots am I even saying that right apricots apricots apricots it's apricots right yeah I've really really loved this juice now it tastes like fruit punch it definitely does but it doesn't taste like nasty fruit punch have you ever had fruit punch where you taste it and you can kind of taste that the color would be red with this fruit punch taste kind of taste like it would just be a fresh light pink fruit punch very very fruity delicious and not overpowering at all definitely recommend this I'm gonna try to do some fate brings I started this video my air was on I was hoping it was gonna shut off but it hasn't so I'm gonna try to do it with my air on and here we go [Music] yeah that's sucked I try to do it on the side of my mic so that the air wasn't blowing on it but it didn't really work but whatever so one more puff here we go [Music] yes I really didn't taste the peach on the inhale that time it was more of a strawberry pineapple ish and the great thing about it is nothing is too predominant in this juice every time I taste a different type of flavor pops out and surprises me and I so love this this would be my very top fruit punch juice if you're a fruit punch lover you've gotta have this one this is a great vape to sit there and vape on next to the pool when you're laying in the Sun just enjoying yourself having a beer maybe even tubing down the river if you're in Arizona you're really really gonna like this I guarantee and another thing I want to say is of all the juices and all the companies that I've tried I would definitely say that glass is the most spot-on I have yet to have a juice from them that I don't like there are two that I wouldn't recommend only for me that I wouldn't buy again and one is a tobacco flavor and that's only because I really don't like tobacco flavors and the other one is a minty flavor and the reason why is because I like menthol flavors but I only like menthol flavors mostly insults so let's do one more for the road I just have to have one more here we go Oh mg once again Caribbean Punch wait this is juicy peach Caribbean punch which I wouldn't say it's juicy peach because peaches in there but it's not a total hello I am a peach situation here definitely love this 5 out of 5 would I buy this again I actually haven't bought this again glass actually sent me a box of juices and I had the Caribbean punch in there and I loved it so much I decided to buy it again so this is another bottle of it that I have bought 5 out of 5 great clouds great everything so once again my name is amateur vapor if you like my video in any way please give me a like hit subscribe hit that Bell button I go live I'm not going to go live this weekend only because I'm still dealing with the medical issue situation I'm gonna let you know what it is I have a blood pressure situation and I'm on two different blood pressure medicines and then I'm also on like an emergency blood pressure medicine because sometimes they don't work even though they've switched it around on me and stuff like that so this week I've actually had to take my emergency blood pressure medicine twice and you're it's supposed to be the silent killer you're not supposed to be able to feel it but I feel it and it just sucks but I have faith that it's gonna go away it went away for several months before so I'm hoping it's gonna go away again and I know that it will you know I have faith in my god and that's all that matters so have a fantastic weekend hopefully I'll do a video

mommy kiss thank you what a sweet boy be my biggest good boy I", "CkIJAJa12xo": "[Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome back two weeks we are talking about the punch bar dark chocolate raspberry flavored it's got itself I don't know if I said this before three servings of 39 calories I can't do that math in my head but you know it's over a hundred maybe like a hundred and twenty calories or something like that so it's an impressive little package actually and I do mean little package for 225 milligrams which it does feel like a 225 milligram edible it does not taste great the dark chocolate is overwhelmed excuse me the dark chocolate and raspberry flavors are the slightest of notes in the chocolate the the biggest note is of course marijuana but it's such a small package it's the smallest edible I've seen so if you're looking for something super discreet or something if you usually eat quickly or not with a lot of calories because that's the best not a whole lot of calories this is a pretty good pretty good value but if you're looking for something that's gonna taste good you might want to pass it again I think I paid eight dollars for it so it's a pretty good value too this is that again is the punch bar dark chocolate raspberry if you see what a dispensary near you totally go ahead and grab one man thanks so much for watching wheats and we'll catch you in

"what's up guys my name is Shana we're back again so today I have a treat for you see what I did there ok so this stuff right here is supposed to be the granddaddy of desert babes this is a vanilla bean ice-cream sandwich between two Fruity Pebbles cereal rice krispies treat things right there this is a big mother bottle of juice right here this bad boy is huge I mean look at that thing it's messes the biggest bottle of juice I think I've ever had even the drip top thing goes all the way down it's absolutely a behemoth when I received this guy it came in this box right here look at that how awesome is that it's like a big wrapped up piece of candy and you got that nice logo on it right there it looks amazing that's actually maybe you want to buy this bottle of juice if you guys haven't seen the promotion for this thing check it out right here so I pretty much saw that thing and I was like oh my god I need to have this like in my life right now okay so inside the actual packaging right here came with a big bag with the juice in it right here as well as a separate unicorn bottle so you don't have to walk around with this big-ass behemoth in your pocket right here haven't really use this bad boy yet I assume it just works like any other drip cap but it does have a also a treats logo on it it didn't just come with a plain generic one right there the marketing for this thing is in full swing it is some really hyped up juice right now the low going is very minimalistic looks really good such treats it looks like a 1980s hotline Miami neon style stuff going on here two three milligrams of nicotine in this manner JAMA and Max VG so really really good drip juice right here so for getting further I've actually never had vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles meshed together as an ice cream sandwich so we're gonna solve that problem right now okay so what I have right here is a vanilla rice krispies treat homemade smash between some vanilla bean ice cream we're gonna go ahead and try this manage a minute then we're gonna compare it to the juice we go ahead and actually do the review on it oh wow yeah I'll prove huh tastes like diabetes okay so now that I've experienced that I know what to expect hopping right on into this bottle right here so we're gonna go ahead and open this bad boy up and start the smell test on it okay so this stuff right here legit smells like some fruity pebble ice cream with a heavy sense of cream coming out of the smell of it it could vape completely different so I have it all loaded up right here an MVP 3.0 Pro Edition tugboat RDA brand-new dual coil build new cotton new everything is loaded up run at 60 watts it's ready to go this is treats buy treats I think hmm it's mixing real well with the treat that I just ate okay so like usual the lemon is very dominant inside this cereal babe however I am tasting the vanilla ice cream a little bit very very cloudy juice it's not so much like a looper it legit tastes like an original juice it's not the greatest thing in the world and if for damn sure does not taste like what I just ate I just think it's a little overhyped I mean the presentation is absolutely amazing with that being said though I do however think it's a really good cereal juice I am getting the vanilla ice cream but it doesn't really taste like an ice cream it tastes more like a standard vanilla mix with some fruity pebbles it has a very distinct amount of cream to it kind of like a fruity pebbles milkshake does that make sense that's kind of what I'm getting out of this like a fruity pebbles vanilla milkshake now the cereal is not as lemony as some other juices out there the lemons is still very dominant inside treats I think with the extra cream and the hint of vanilla to it it actually holds its own do I think it's worth 50 bucks no I do not however it does only come in 120 milliliters so if you guys do want to try yourself dropping 250 bucks on maybe you guys can pitch in with some friends and you guys can all take like 30 mils out of it or something like that and just kind of share the bottle pass it around do that sort of thing and if you like it then go ahead and spend the extra 50 bucks and get yourself your own personal Boheme a--the right here I do think it's a little overhyped however it's still a solid cereal juice it's not a bad juice by any means I do wish it had more of like a marshmallowy taste to it versus like a creaminess sample it out a little bit because it is an investment this is a $50 bottle of ejuice right here now you do get a lot of a juice however if you don't like it you're stuck with a behemoth of a juice that you're not probably not going to use and you're probably gonna give away to your friends I however thoroughly enjoy it I think it's a pretty good juice I'm giving it a solid two thumbs up just because it does kind of hold its own in the cereal market and the presentation is amazing the juice is a it's definitely a top not a juice I like max VG juices so one of my favorite cereal juices on the market right now is kilos cereal milk and I still prefer kilos cereal milk over treats right here now I do have the juice and I'm gonna let this steep for a little bit longer and it's probably going to grow on me a lot more bottom line though it's a solid juice if you guys want to make the investment on it I'll put the link right down to description as far as being overhyped I really don't have anything bad to say about it it's still a pretty good juice and I will gladly recommend it and that's about it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for another one hi", "6sBWiwLyvK4": "[Music] no till uh orange spatula sick you're a long time wheats fan you know what that means it means I'm breaking my cardinal rule today fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun result I will check you out on the next review thanks for

and pineapple but I smell that really funky pineapple but I got and I remember I did a review a couple days back what a pineapple flavoring in it and it was really terrible I smell like the sweet fruit punch but there's that pineapple in there that yeah I'm gonna change the RDA I don't want to taste the ever-lovin to that all right we'll just need that there we'll use the original goon that one that one will suffice ok alright so yeah a small fruit punch but it's that pineapples really throwing me off alright let's give it a taste oh no no no man you got you companies out there what way do you get this damn flavoring from it actually tastes bad like very harsh and and I don't want to use this one either I want to go for a higher homage so I'm gonna use the drop so low let's do that cuz I ain't got no menthol serve you 0.3 I'm gonna bring the wattage down to around 70 because I definitely don't want to really taste that because I know it's gonna taste like [ __ ] terrible terrible and I'm not even done yet I didn't even vape that [ __ ] alright we're gonna go ahead and saturate that one oh we can I'll see you [ __ ] in a minute the pineapple smells like ass and its really harsh on the taste we get the oranges and everything else here but that pineapple flavoring I don't know how many times I'm gonna say it but yeah I'll say it again maybe alright 53.9 Oh Watson this one's tropical 100 fruit punch doesn't give this [ __ ] every maybe you should open the airholes you're super dick ain't sorry I am giving the fruit punch but I am also getting that harsh really weird pineapple in the backend I don't know if they I don't know if that's the orange flavor it could be the orange and the pineapple mixed together but I still I honestly don't like it I don't like when they use that kind of flavoring it's very like shitty yeah I mean at the end it gets it gets better but in the beginning you taste that flavoring and it just really harsh cuz yeah yeah no I don't like that I don't like that at all this is not a good impression good impression I'm looking at the name and they said impression and tropical impression wow it's not a good impression impression from tropical 100 I don't know where they going they trying to bribe off make it 100 you ain't coming close to that [ __ ] with this [ __ ] alright alright guys so I don't really like it I don't think too

experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m.

complicated life at this stage making some rice krispie treats but they're fruity pebble flavored ashley could see how stressed that was why he she sounds like a dog and left", "UFZyDK4w884": "yeah I think the guy who drew the artwork for these games used to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time [Music] it was 1984 those 1984 guys [Music] Oh [ __ ] it was an action but he knows an action button [Applause] [Music] take that go up shoot the enemy go down [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] good tired I love this D oh [ __ ] it changes directions it tricked me no that's the chat that's laughing right now the action one throws me

difficulty settings I mean we already know what we're gonna pick [Music] there we go there's worship oh I love the music already oh [ __ ] [Music] energize their Rashid Oh ah [Music] I like how you still I was like when he's the kid he's like still like super hardcore you know [Music] holy [ __ ] look at the sequence aha boy is here [Music] [Music] I thought money was ease [Music] No [Music] dude I have a fraction of a second in confession get ready and ready what you want to hold it down or something I think at the hold it down or there might be another button that I don't know about what the [ __ ] I'm gonna mash it [Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again real quick just in case if it doesn't work then we could try the arcade version but it would be impossible it would be virtually impossible without knowing the directions because you [ __ ] impossible [Music] Oh Oh you could continue maybe this will work where is the same this is yeah this is seen before see if it goes further yeah this week this scene is so [ __ ] long I couldn't imagine spending a dollar on this [ __ ] [Music] please work it's thought it's actually [ __ ] dude no this port sucks what should we do what should we do there's a million parts of this game though I'm sure I can find another port or another stream a mill there's a million ports of this game ok we'll try one more time on a new on a fresh thing and we'll see what happens if it doesn't work then we can try the arcade roll Avenger what you're glad come out though you guys are breaking the rules without rules here you guys now that we've played one laser at this

in a single stream like that guys there's rules that's trying to game I put the move beeps on this time we change the difficulty maybe you think that won't make a difference [Music] I was just gonna say both of those oh okay whatever will I'll put it the captaincy it makes a difference so you said slash for energized [Music] now I didn't do anything we do not know what the energized button is

some runs", "J0nuBEQg4NU": "what's up all my vaping friends and family of youtube josh beck once again with another liquid review for you all right so i had to wait all [ __ ] weekend because the [ __ ] at the post office doesn't know how to do a [ __ ] job instead of getting all the mail sorted and situated on saturday so that people can get their [ __ ] before the post office closes at noon time she waits until the [ __ ] is completely closed and then does all the slips for the boxes so you could imagine my disappointment when i went and stopped on my way to work at 11 a.m and my [ __ ] wasn't available to me nor would she just check and see if she could find it real quick which really kind of pissed me off i live in a very small town there are not that many [ __ ] po boxes at this [ __ ] place and i think it's [ __ ] that this lady's only half-assing our job if i worked there i would get as many shits done as i possibly could and you know try to make people as happy as possible because you know coronavirus what do we have we have [ __ ] that we're ordering online and that's what's keeping us [ __ ] happy insane and [ __ ] wonderful and yeah so enough of the ramble and the rant ejuicecorner.com i picked this up this is a triple triple zero flavor e-liquid company llc um never heard of them or it's either triple o or triple zero or three zero or three o flavors i don't i don't know um but uh yeah so this is a very short stop and the only reason i even picked this up is because i was watching uh what's his name the vaping insider and he got one of those vape tins and in that vape tin was a bottle of this and i did notice that the other two bottles that he got in his vape tin were bottles that i would consider to be disgusting but for some reason i was intrigued by this one i figured maybe they just give you one good one and a couple of shitty ones just so they can [ __ ] with you because the juices that were in his tin that he paid 70 dollars for you can get for like 99 cents over 1.99 on most sites right now because people are trying to clear them out of stock and i found this on a juice corner for only 6.99 so i was like [ __ ] yeah i'm gonna try that and they had some other flavors i actually have one in here i'm not gonna review this at the same time but it's called glory stripes and as you can see it's a bomb pop flavor so that one i finger tasted all of these and getting into this one i was concerned right off the bat as soon as i tasted it on my finger because the bakery element that is in it was familiar to me in a bad way and i thought it was going to translate into disgusting [ __ ] but i got a surprise but we'll get into that so all right so this is a 120 milliliter bottle that i got for 6.99 i looked on the website on um the juice corner and it doesn't say anywhere on the bottle but supposedly this is a hundred percent vg e-liquid max bg juice um three milligram nicotine and it is a obviously it's a uh a shortbread strawberry shortbread whipped cream flavor very clear e-liquid on the finger i get a nice sweet strawberry um a nice sweet strawberry with cream and that little bakery note in the back but the bakery note it tastes delicious on the finger but it's a taste that i remember it was really good and then i vaped it and it was disgusting and another juice but it's not the case with this it translates very good very very good so we got it loaded up in the hugs vape theseus rda with a recurve drip tip on top it's a dual 26 gauge with 36 on the outside ni 80 i believe it's like six wraps and it's omen out at a point three seven we're going to hit this at 50 7.5 watts this stuff is so good so good like i'm not a huge fan of any strawberry anything because it it gets old so [ __ ] fast everything strawberry tastes the same to me 90 of it is just the same [ __ ] but this has a very genuine like strawberries and simple syrup sweet delicious strawberry taste and you get the whipped cream and you get like the biscuit or shortbread whatever like it's it's literally an identical to the real thing dessert flavor like i [ __ ] you not if you bought this you would not regret it if you like dessert flavors and you like strawberry dessert flavors this is the [ __ ] [ __ ] like i was so excited about it after i had tried it that i had to fill my uh my gear rta up i had dumped out the juice that was in it and washed it and i was like i gotta [ __ ] try it in this too because it's phenomenal i was chain vaping outside just sitting on my porch just [ __ ] head after head after hit and i i was like oh my god this is so good it just gets better with every vape and i just can't even [ __ ] explain it but like i said it's it's as close to the real deal that you can get as far as like the flavor what it tastes like it's so [ __ ] delicious and zero throat hit which makes me think it might be 100 vg it just seems like it's thinner but it's a clear e-liquid from vaping it pretty high wattage on a 0.37 um i've only been vaping it a couple hours the coil is still clean the cotton is still clean loaded up in this tank just barely filled this thing we're going to take a rip off of this then we're going to do our zero fives sweetness how close is the description overall zero to ten how much i enjoy this e-liquid or don't or whether i recommend it that's [ __ ] nuts that's so nuts how good that is this is a stainless steel quad core uh clapton 45 watts is what i just ripped i i can bump this up even more i'm gonna go to 50. it's so good like it almost makes me want to cry like i i wish i could produce tears right now because this this is that good um so zero to five on sweetness it's like a four to a four and a quarter it's not overpoweringly sweet and it's not under sweet it's like the perfect amount where like you could consistently vape it and you're not gonna be like god this is [ __ ] too much or too little or it's just you know bland it's not right whatever it's like a perfect sweetness um yeah so four to a four and a quarter on the description zero to five it's perfect shortbread strawberry whipped cream 100 all the way i get every element of flavor in this this e-liquid is crazy good i don't understand why they're only selling it for 6.99 it's part of the clearance right now i guess people weren't that interested in that nobody really knows about this juice i only found it on vaping insider and the only reason he was even revealing it is because it came in his vape tin other than that you cannot find a review of this i put in barry shortstop into youtube and i came up with uh nothing nothing but uh what is it basics uh blueberry cake which i did a review on that's all i can find when i put in barry shortstop so i'm flat out 100 telling you you need to get this [ __ ] this is really good if you like desserts and you like strawberry this is really [ __ ] good um so a spot on five on the description as to what the flavor is and overall zero to ten i don't take this lightly but this is a ten this 100 is a ten and i got 120 milliliters of a for 6.99 ejuicecorner.com absolutely [ __ ] get this [ __ ] it is wonderful all right so we're going to take another rip one and get the [ __ ] out of here i'd like to thank you once again for watching chasing clouds and flavor reviews please like subscribe comment and share and please do comment because i really love it when you do it makes me so happy bring another rip of this and like i said we're out of here thanks again [Applause] stay cloudy", "h7ioOGvVDao": "hi everybody and welcome to Baker madness a cannabis friendly cooking and baking show where we will eventually someday maybe potentially bake or cook something today is munch Monday so I've gone to one of my dispensaries here in Washington State and I picked up a new edible that I haven't tried before and I brought it home I'm gonna eat it right now in front of you and I'm gonna critique it and tell ya what's good these edibles are available here in Washington State and also for my friends that are watching in Oregon let's go so today when I picked up something that I probably won't need a lot of but it sure is nice for a treat today I went and I tried a new company called ho new Oh No this company's name is actually Hawaiian for great sea turtle or green sea turtle sea turtles in Hawaiian mythology stand for serenity [Music] longevity wisdom stability and it's uh it's a Hawaiian myth there's a Hawaiian myth that says that it was the Honu who brought the first civilization to who led the first inhabitants to Hawaii so that's kind of close if you go to their website there's more there's more talk about their mission statement and why they decided to go with the name Honu they have a [ __ ] ton of flavors of stuff I had to pick they had in my in my dispensary that I went to the other day they probably had 14 flavors and overall they probably have 20 plus ho nude chocolate turtles won first place edibles and overall Grand Champion in Colorados rooster magazine in 2019 now this package is an older package these were made in November of last year so they're not old they've got a year shelf life on them but they don't have any of the nutritional nutritional facts the new edibles that are coming out all have all of the new packaging has calories fat content all that kind of stuff this does not but these are all the ingredients and a liquid take your time read them all there's wheat there's milk there's pecans you're soy there's coconut they don't say which part of the candy is infused but they do you see right here they separate indica and sativa when I asked for the turtles she said that I want indica or sativa so that's kind of cool if you don't know we have indica which is kind of a couch lock situation okay that's a very heavy sunset I'd kind of situation indica sativa sativa goes by sativa Achieva you might have heard makes you want to paint a fence or do art or whatever I like a hybrid my personal favorites are the hybrids that way you get to sunset eyes from the indica and you get the kind of creative jazz from the center from the sativa anyway yeah lots of ingredients corn syrup but no no heavy corn syrup palm oil and palm kernel oil I'm not real hip to that but they're in here look up palm kernel oil in politics I'm here for distraction I'm not here to make a stand so we're just gonna eat the delicious candy today we're having delicious Honu chocolate truffles ten milligrams each a hundred milligrams per the whole bag here's what they look like oh my gosh they're so good I already had a few or a dozen I read about the packaging today Honu has an actual page about their packaging Washington state regulation requires that the candy be each piece of candy be in a child resistant package they've chosen plastic as some you could rip through some you cannot I've had to cut these open with the scissors I got them out they're so freakin yummy okay now so you have chocolate a chocolate wafer stuck on to that is a salty pretzel stuck on to that is a glob of caramel and then a toasted pecan on the top I don't know if it's toasted it might be wrong and they don't describe which part of the this candy is the infused part I'm assuming it's probably the caramel it might be the chocolate is probably the caramel because they're using them they're using coconut oil as the as the vehicle to carry the cannabis all right here we go oh my god [Music] that was delicious oh my god oh my god oh wow the salty the sweet the

"the Sauco, the Sauco and the berries that we make some of our compounds out of.  Here is a plant in front of us that is known in Central America by the Spanish speaking Indian they call the Sauco, is a plant that in the berries we find that the mineral of iron is found, iron phosphate iron phosphate is found in these berries and these berries are responsible for us reversing a lot of diseases that sits in the blood they contain iron phosphate. This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "CYRpuIf_zCw": "hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today however we are not going to be reviewing a product we are going to be doing an experiment we're going to be experimenting to see whether or not eating an edible on an empty stomach can enhance your high so I went to the dispensary and picked up two of my favorite edibles on the dark sneakers bars by mcclenney confections and what we're gonna do is on the first video I'm going to consume this dark Snickers bar here and it has been roughly 15 hours since I've had any food in my body so I'm gonna eat this entire thing and then not in any food after to see if my high is enhanced from eating this on I can't entirely empty seven then on the second video I'm going to eat the other dark Snickers bar right after consuming a too big meal and to see if that affects the high as well to see if I'm not quite as high as from the first dark sneakers on an empty stomach so this will be a series of two videos again first one empty stomach second one on a full stomach to see if the high is in hits or if it is detracted from an empty or full stomach alright so let's go ahead and open up this dark Snickers bar here eat it up and come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling after you eating this whole thing on an empty stomach if you've not seen my review of the dark Snickers bar you suggest you go check it out I love this product it only costs seven dollars at my dispensary it's a 200 milligram edible and it tastes delicious and it gets you pretty [ __ ] up YUM I do love that candy bar okay and so with that guys I'm gonna finish this off and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling after eating this whole thing on a completely empty stomach you see if it's gonna hit me harder or not and then on the next video we'll eat this one on the full stomach and let you know if it's hitting less harder or not so with that I will see you guys in two hours to go to the next level of this experiment thank you so much for watching wheats we'll see you soon hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had this dark Snickers bar and I'm not a hundred percent sure I would say that I'm more high than I was if I had eaten this on a full stomach or with any food don't feel more high I think then when I have had the dark sneakers in the past on an empty stomach or on a full stomach or you know having eaten recently but it's hard to say for exact sure for exactly sure until I do my next experiment which will be my next video where I will be eating one of these immediately after eating a huge meal to see if I feel less high than I do now but it seems like eating on an empty stomach does not necessarily increase your high but I'm not sure if eating on a full stomach will decrease your high or not for that one what to check out the next video and thank you so much for watching wheat skies but for now I'm gonna say eating on an empty stomach does not enhance your high thank you so much for watching wheats guys we'll see you on the next video hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll

how to make the weed nugget strawberries well the weed nugget chocolate covered strawberries so what i'm going to do is i'm going to get some of the golden oreos and i'm going to put them in my blender and i'm going to go ahead and get these crushed up because i want it to be nice and finely chopped this is how we want it to look i almost like sand all right so what i've done is separated it in two different bags um you can use some sandwich bags if you would like and then i'm going to use some purple and green food coloring and you just want to drop a few in there just to get it the color that you prefer so first i'm going to start off with the green and i'm just going to do it a little light not too dark and then i'm going to separate it and do a little bit of it just just a little darker than the first batch and just keep adding drops the grain that i got so far so i'm just going to dump a little bit of this one into another bag and then i'm going to get the other half of this a little bit darker a little darker than the last one so i'm gonna go ahead and get that poured into the other bag as well this is how it looks so far and you can just leave it like this if you want um you don't have to add the purple or you can get it darker you can make it as light however you prefer it so now i'm going to go in and make the purple if you can see it a little purple and you can make it as dark or as light as you would like it so what i'm gonna do is i'm to add a little bit of this to my green and i think i'm going to keep it this color i'm not going to add any more purple and i'm going to go ahead and pour it in a bowl just to see if you can see it a little bit better all right so i'm going to be using white chocolate for mine and i do have a video on my channel if you want to see how i thin out my chocolate as well and i'm just doing these just to show you all this is just like a small demonstration i'm not making them for anyone just for myself so if you're more comfortable with using a toothpick you can do that or you can just hold them by the stems and dip them if you would like it's up to you first i'm going to go in with my white chocolate make sure you get the extra chocolate off and then i'm just gonna twirl it around in my cookie crumbs just like that all right guys so after they have dried this is what they will look like uh and if you want to add like the cigarillos to them you can get some um pretzel rice dip them in milk chocolate and then just dip the ends of it in the cookie crumbs as well so i hope you all enjoyed this video today

"l13SfeCm65c": "okay everybody so I have a bag here that I found I met with the owners last night and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like how did you make a bad child loop and I'm like I literally couldn't open it and it just went pow and I was like oh my god is this so amazing so there you go but this year we'll actually see oh that the odor in and then it's child proof at the same time up to maybe like age 13 depending on the IQ level I think Oh anyway I don't know this will solve your problem right there you can have that just take it home and play with it now you actually got a bet you got something you were just gnarling I think we're ready to pull your own hair yeah so yeah I think it's it's a pretty neat product it's kind of smart yeah so it's back and in the front pull it from I'll give you guys I have more detailed demonstration actually here to be sure maybe you might not be able to see it so she actually tried to bite on this thing and you can tell so anyways um normally bags are open up right in the front here but you can't open it so obviously an average kid may not figure it out but you know depending on their IQ level so you have to pull the back here okay with the front and then it opens up that way and you reach back into the front here okay so there you guys have it this is a EEP AK flexible packaging made in USA thanks guys hope you guys enjoyed this video", "Zzn-V5KCBoc": "good morning and welcome to another edition of bill johnson's cereal reviews i'm your host bill johnson and this morning it's time for coffee it's time for international delights fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles in honor of the birthday the 50th birthday of fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles you can find these products on everything from dunkin cakes to uh coffee creamers to crisps it's getting wild out there for fruity pebbles so if you're a fruity pebbles fan this is the renaissance um i love coffee a lot i love international delight they make a creamer called cinnabon creamer it's my most viewed uh video i'll include a link down below to make it more viewed but let's check it out i already poured them i already stirred them i think i'm going to start with the fruity pebbles now this one looks just like milk so you don't need a visual there very fruity and not smell it i would say it doesn't really smell that much like fruity pebbles kind of smells like i don't know generic fruity smell uh i don't know that has a weird aftertaste to it i think that's not good i love the bottle the bottle is fantastic the smell and the taste do not match fruity pebbles which is what i was looking for it's super weird and i'm gonna give it a two don't buy that this one on the other hand right as you can see it just looks like chocolate milk cocoa pebbles and smell it it smells like chocolate milk but this one gets a bit of more of a pass fruity pebbles has a distinct smell and flavor cocoa pebbles is more the chocolate milk variety you can get away with just making chocolate creamer and slapping cocoa pebbles on it very chocolatey if you like chocolate creamers home run um i would actually say let me taste this one more time hmm you ever had that candy rollos it kind of tastes like rolos if they call this rolos actually no incorrect incorrect i'm wrong incorrect it tastes like tootsie rolls not rolos 41 brain not as good as it used to be they should have called this tootsie rolls creamer and it would have been identical it tastes identical to tootsie rolls nothing like cocoa pebbles p.s i don't really like tootsie rolls so i'm gonna give these a four these are not good and there are fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles in name only this was a waste of ten dollars do not buy these but please do like subscribe comment down below put that in your mug and drink it", "wGLelLSwMS8": "okay welcome back to you weeks everyone the marijuana edibles review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at another product from punch combo we are looking at the peanut butter dark chocolate punch combo 225 milligrams of THC 39 calories per serving three servings in the package we're going to ignore all that and eat this whole bad boy to see how it makes us feel now I have had one punch combo before I quite liked it it wasn't the best tasting snack I've ever attaboy I've ever had but it did hit pretty hard as advertised and it's been such a small discreet little package I mean like look at that a tiny little package with 225 milligrams of THC and it doesn't taste terrible it doesn't taste great but you can definitely Jack it down oh I didn't even notice this before 9 individual 25 milligram doses it shows you what it looks like when it's broken down they're pretty nice not that you really need a reminder Oh berry peanut buttery looking so there you go a lot of peanut butter a lot of chocolate there she is again this is the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate that we are reviewing on wheats 225 no make up 225 milligrams of THC here we go it's not bad you can still taste the weed um I think it's actually better than the dark chocolate raspberry yeah the peanut butter helps mask the weed flavor better but there is definitely a wee taste to it but it's not terrible I mean you're not gonna you know struggle to get this down it might even taste good dis done not to me but again 225 milligrams of THC in this tiny little package so let's go and polish it bad way off you knew I liked you all right well that wraps up for the punch combo nice and easy to get dem don't have to sit there in two for an hour um but the most important thing as we know guys is not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so I will come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling then and hopefully it's just like the other punch combo and packs a powerful wallet so guys I'll check back with you in two hours until then thanks for watching everyone has been two hours and welcome back to weeds we are talking about whoops we are talking hello everyone it has been 2 hours welcome back to weeds uh I have just welcome to wheats everyone it has been two hours since I consumed the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate bar and I'm feeling pretty good I like this line a lot like its predecessor not necessarily saying one came before the other just in the way that I ate the minutes its predecessor it didn't taste super great but uh I feel pretty baked right now and it's such an impressive small little package I feel like you could just throw this in any bag you could take this with you just to anywhere maybe on your way to the airport super super discreet and it for being that potent it's just really really impressive so if you see the punch combo peanut butter dark chocolate at your dispensary near you

petables crisp by post so cocoa pebbles crisp crispy rice snacks natural and artificial chocolate flavor actual size serving size is uh 17 pieces at 140 calories 6 grams of fat 20 grams of carbs and 1 gram of protein whoa and for the fruity pebbles serving size is 17 pieces at 140 calories 6 grams of fat 20 grams of carbs in one gram of protein first off i just want to say i think this is brilliant because as i've matured i've realized that some of the best tasting cereal is fruity pebbles and cocoa pebbles but the issue is if you're trying to snack on them without a bowl and a spoon you're going to spill it all over the place you can't drive and eat fruity pebbles it goes everywhere then you have ants in your car this has fixed that because you basically have a potato chip sized cereal piece i think this is brilliant we're going to start off with the fruity pebbles oh it smell it smells like play-doh look at that that is beautiful you don't know how happy i am right now the exact same flavor fruity pebbles but in easy snackable format i do have to say the actual pebbles are a little crispier than these these seem seem to be the slightest bit less crispy in comparison but i'm not going to complain too much the sweetness is the same the flavor is the same i do think it would have been cool if they could you know did a little bit of rebranding and just call these like um fruity discs instead of pebbles or fruity boulders but i understand you got to maintain a brand image i think this would be great do like a cereal lasagna cereal dip um i can't say they're better than fruity pebbles but it does make them easier to eat because here's my thinking let's say you buy this and you want to have a bowl of fruity pebbles you just crush this up and you have a bowl of fruity pebbles you can't squish fruity pebbles together to have discs to eat so i see this is more versatile in comparison to the actual fruity pebbles because you can break this down you can't build fruity pebbles up 96 out of 100 i wish these were crisper it seemed the slightest bit still now i wish the flavor was a little bit stronger i think fruity pebbles are a little bit stronger in their potency still spectacular oh i will be buying this again should they'll probably be never a time in my life that i don't have this on the shelf now the cocoa pebbles so a little more like bowl shaped these are crispier i should have bought some cocoa pebbles so i could have compared the flavor because i don't think these taste like cocoa pebbles it almost tastes like a tootsie roll it's good but i think cocoa pebbles actually have more of a cocoa flavor and these have more of a artificial chocolate tootsie roll flavor yeah i'm pretty sure this is a different chocolate flavor um 86 out of 100 while they're crisper than the fruity pebbles the flavors come across as unnatural and it does not remind me of cocoa pebbles this tastes like a generic chocolate it's not really a cocoa more of a chocolate flavoring i'm disappointed in the flavor here it's chocolaty but not cocoa pebbles chocolate if you know what i mean try them out i will buy the fruity pebbles again but not probably not the cocoa pebbles it's just disappointing flavor i like the texture love the concept love the concept now if we can just start getting wafer sheets at the grocery store oh then we'll be living in the future

but super calm and in this video I'm gonna show you how to open the Korova Saturday morning cookie so one other thing that this offers is childproof packaging when I first got this I didn't really realize that it was childproof packaging and I was kind of ripping and tearing at it and getting frustrated because I couldn't quite open it you know and every time I would I would kind of just I would have to fight it but after a little bit of research I figured out that on the package here it has the instructions for the childproof packaging so there is a technique to opening these things and I'm gonna show you how to do that in the video so here's the packaging and it has a little tear tab on here you can see I've already open this up so you just basically just tear it peel this off once you get this open you look inside and you'll see okay it looks kind of like a normal ziplock bag and you kind of want to you know just open it thinking that that'll pull it but that's not really the case and then if you're trying to peel this apart you'll notice that it is like you know seriously stuck to the packaging itself and then once you get down to this portion right here you notice that there's this part right here that's open and that's actually the part that you need to stick your thumb in so what you do oh and by the way the oil from the cookie sometimes makes it makes this bag a little bit slippery so just be aware of that and that's kind of what I was thinking is it's a it's it's a little bit frustrating I know I'm all for Children's packaging you know child packaging and stuff like that but this is a little it's a little bit difficult especially if it's a little bit oily from the cookie but what you do is you put your thumb down in here and what yours what you're trying to do is you're trying to separate right there you can see how it separates this little ziploc thing here and then once you get that open you're supposed to do something like that and like I said it's a little bit difficult you can see I've already taken in my sighting one cookie here but you know to reclose it you just kind of you know like a normal ziploc bag pinch it down and then just go across and and this thing is like heavy-duty ziplock so no kids are gonna get in there I can guarantee that and I think some you know serious like adults are not going to get in there either because this thing is a little bit difficult but let me try it one more time so you just pop your thumb in there and then separate it out all right let's try that one more time so go ahead open this up this way once you get inside be sure to find the portion where you're supposed to stick your thumb which is separated from the packaging and then you can go ahead and stick your thumb down in there and you can figure out your own technique that I like to do this and then pinch it here once you get your thumb in there just pinch it like that and then you pinch hold and pull and I wouldn't really try to force it because it feels like when you try to force it it almost feels like it it doesn't want to open so that's where the frustration can come in from this packaging I think because it's really there's not a lot to work with at least I don't know cuz my hands a little bigger maybe if you had smaller hands it might be better but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad so one of the things well I can already tell this is been out for a little while but you definitely want to put this in the refrigerator you can see the cookie itself it this has been out of the refrigerator for about I don't know maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes and you can already see how this is starting to like you can see how like kind of I don't even want to say it's a moist it almost it's almost like succulent it's weird but this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much inside and unfortunately I started this video before I should have shown you the whole cookie but I'll show you what's left I'm gonna go ahead and eat this now let me show you how big this cookie really is so it's a decent size I've already eaten almost half of it as you can see excuse me while I finish it kind of has a coconut birthday cake flavor to it and as you can see it's fairly thick and I kind of want to break this off just to show you I mean you can see that this cookie is really really moist I don't want to break it all the way but this to me is almost it's it's it needs to go back in the fridge so definitely store your thing in the fridge like I said since this is a video about childproof packaging you know I just would like to say if you have little ones try to stash it in the best place possible but I'm pretty certain that even if your little one was to find something like this because it's got you know cool graphics on it you know there's a cookie on it or at least something that looks like a cookie it's you know it's enticing so I do think that if your little one did find this I think that would have a very hard time getting into this thing they would have to get very lucky you know their little small fingers might be able to find their way into that but you know the other thing is if your bag is a little bit oily maybe that's a better thing because then you know little fingers will slip off of this thing but anyways hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the Korova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "XHcIX8pKj8w": "[Music] i have to come on here and say this again because it's a couple days later but these are so good i had no idea how much i was gonna like them i'm usually not a huge chocolate strawberry person but with the cookies on them oh my god you guys they're amazing what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you guys how to make chocolate covered strawberry milks they look like nugs but they aren't nuts it's true um so yeah these don't include any um weed but i am using coconut oil on them so if you want to swap the coconut oil for something else i mean to each their own you can do whatever you like but yeah these are really easy to make i think you guys are going to like them let's get to the recipes so here's my strawberries they're not the best strawberries i've ever seen um for a couple reasons one i can't find strawberries for some reason i finally found some and as soon as i saw them i went to the store my eyes were like zoomed like right into them i like booked it it was the last little container of them yeah they're not that good but and then they've been sitting in my fridge for like three or four days i'm needing to film this video but if you watch my last video where i was like crying and stuff i just i wasn't feeling the best this weekend and i wasn't really in a place to be filming a video i don't really like filming videos unless i'm like feeling good um but yeah i'm feeling good now so um let's make these chocolate covered strawberries so the first thing you need to do is wash and dry your strawberries i did this yesterday well because i hadn't intentions to make this video yesterday but you want to watch enjoy them because if they have moisture on them they're not going to last very well so this is like very very crucial because no matter how good you do all the other steps because moisture on your strawberries they won't turn out well so you need to make sure they're nice nicely dried to make these all you're going to need is some golden oreos or cookies that look like this some strawberries chocolate i'm using chocolate chips but you could use nitro chocolate and some green food coloring and maybe some coconut oil if you want we're going to crush our oreos to make the outside coating for the strawberries um you don't have to use uh oreos you could use any sort of cookie that has this type of color so there's lots of cookies like that and you can do this we're gonna crush them and you could do it in a bag you could do it in a blender i have a food processor so i'm gonna use that but um like i said you could use many different things to crush them and pour that in there okay now we're going to color them and i have a few different food colorings i have like different shades of green um and i have some yellow if i want to like kind of play around with it but i feel like you can just whatever you want right i think i'm gonna do this moss green that looks like it'll be good so i'm gonna color most of this green and then i'm gonna color a little bit of purple to get that um accurate nut looking if you don't have purple or you don't have what is it that makes purple blue and red makes purple i think i'm not sure you can look up if you don't have things to make purple you could also use regular oreos like the blackish brown oreos to kind of get that contrast of color or you could just do green and just do different shades of it you don't need much of the purple so i'm just gonna set aside a little bit of um some of these to color people and then these ones we're going to color different colors of green or different shades of green okay i'm thinking this gel food coloring is going to be too difficult to use that's going to be a hassle to color that all so let's use the liquid thank god i have that on hand and i could have done this in the um food press processor or blend or whatever but food coloring oh my goodness i don't want to get food coloring everything because i make a mess with food coloring but you could do it in there i feel like this purple is not going to be fun to get to mix i feel like i might have to microwave this one so that um the gel food coloring can be a little tricky to get to mix just what i keep at home so i mean i would recommend not using gel for coloring and just use regular food coloring okay i'm just gonna put those in the microwave quickly because it's just not mixing now we can get to the actual strawberries so like i said i'm eating chocolate chips you could use a nicer chocolate but this is just what i chose so you can do this over a double boiler i'm going to use a microwave i know you guys love when i use the microwave just kidding if you're new everybody here they hate when i use my kids like why did you use microwave i just i like the microwave okay i'm gonna need more chocolate than that so this is we're gonna add the coconut oil now you can use whatever coconut oil you like if you know what i mean but um i'm just using this one and this is to make it easier to dip so it doesn't like um be so like thick and also keeps it since we're microwaving it it's going to keep it liquidier so that i don't have to constantly re-melt it whereas like if you're keeping the chocolate over a double boiler you aren't really going to need to have to worry about it needing to remelt but i always add a little bit of oil to my chocolate when i'm dipping it in anything and the amount is not super important this is like it's like a little bit less than a tablespoon and i have a cup of chocolate chips here but i don't follow a certain ratio it's just that's just what i'm using here so i'm gonna go microwave that and i'll be right back okay so i melted the chocolate in the microwave and it's important when you melt chocolate in the microwave but you do it in increments of like 10 15 20 seconds you just don't want to put it in there for like a whole minute and then take it out because it'll burn into this wall so just do it for a little bit of time stir it a little by time stir it and you can use white chocolate candy melts whatever it doesn't matter when you're dipping them you can use a toothpick you can use your fingers i'm going to be using my fingers to just me eating them um or i'll try both we'll see what works better and i just have some parchment paper here that i'm gonna line them on and i'm using roomish coldish temperature um strawberries again don't judge my not so good looking strawberries they've been sitting around for a while okay so you'll dip it in chocolate and then you can either wait for the excess to drip off or you can just like scrape it off considering we're covering it in this it doesn't really matter if it looks perfect but i don't like too much chocolate on it because then it's just like too much chocolate not enough strawberry but don't get me wrong like a lot of chocolate but trust me you're going to be eating a lot of chocolate when you're eating these so i like to get as much as i can off and then we're just going to i feel like this toothpick is going to fall off okay so there's the first one yeah that toothpick is not so secure i'm just gonna set it on my tray there i feel like the toothpicks are kind of pointless i'm gonna try without get a bit of a better grip here just had the camera over here turned off i thought it was wrong but i mean i'm sure you guys can kind of see what i'm doing but let's just now i have it back on here and that's kind of how they look let me show you guys close up although i'll show you guys again after and i kind of like when they look a little bit messy because it makes them look a little bit more i don't know real instead of like a perfect strawberry like having those little like bumps on them and it looks kind of nice and i'm sure you guys have noticed the little hearts in the background that's because i thought this would be a super cute um idea for valentine's day and i tried so hard to try and find a heart-shaped box because i thought these would be so cute um if you put them in like these and then put them into a heart-shaped box just like chocolate but i could not find a heart-shaped box i did not look that hard i also didn't want to like just buy a heart-shaped box like just for the video to like not use because i'm not giving these to anyone they are for me my sister will probably eat them together i think this one's going to look nice it's a nice little shape you know we might not actually need more chocolate i thought we were going to but it looks like this should be enough these stems are a little rough looking since i've like took so long to get to this video but it kind of kind of goes with the the look maybe i don't know [Music] yeah see i kind of have a blob of chocolate on this one so that's just me being lazy don't get lazy but with these ones you can kind of like fix them by just adding more of this cookie on it and because like i said they don't have to look perfect and almost not looking perfect kind of like makes them look more real that's okay [Music] so yeah they are pretty much done this is all you have to do and then you um if you want to eat them right away you can put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes let them set um but otherwise they're actually best uh best served or best stored room temperature so you can leave them in at like a coolish room temperature um and yeah you can put them in the fridge if you like but they will sweat in the fridge they have to be careful with that i think i'm gonna put mine in these little liners and that's it guys they're done they're so easy to make they turned out so cute i think they're adorable well mine still need to cool so they're not um like hardened yet but yes i think they look beautiful and very happy with them they're so cute i'm gonna try eating one now and see how it tastes i just have to take my invisalign out first i don't actually know if i'm gonna like them because honestly i don't know if i like the idea of cookies on the outside of strawberries like i like cookies but i don't know if i like it together so let's find out we'll see i like cookies on strawberries they're actually really really good i think you're gonna be a little bit better in the fridge i think i put a little bit too much coconut oil in the chocolate because i can kind of taste the coconut oil maybe use a little bit less it's really just for smoothing out the chocolate but yeah they're delicious thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you all have a wonderful day and valentine's day if you're watching this around that time thank you guys bye [Music] you", "tMcZkCCEJag": "hi everybody and welcome back so today we're going to be taking a look at two flavor well we're going to be testing out two flavors from the glass basic lime the first one is going to be the banana cream pie and the next one is going to be the sugar cookie um if you don't know my favorite all-time favorite blueberry flavor is actually their blueberry cake absolutely loved it i haven't really gotten any other ones somebody i think sent me that or i got it because somebody recommended it the blueberry one fell in love with it i even made a dupe on my diy um on elr for my diy flavors and i vape it all the time because i like it that much so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these i do have mine in three milligrams of nicotine they do come in 60 ml bottles these are actually 70 30 vgpg and the banana cream pie is described as a banana cream pie so original so this is what it looks like so that's the banana cream pie again 70 30 vgpg and they do come in 60 ml bottles the next one that i have is the sugar cookie and the sugar cookie also comes in 60 ml bottle and 3 milligrams of nicotine is my preferred with um 60 ml bottle 70 30 vgpg so let me see the description of this one we already got the description of this one is actually cinnamon glaze sugar cookies i am so excited i love sugar cookies i love banana and banana cream pie and banana pudding and everything bananas so i'm really really excited so let's go ahead and do this now i do have a fresh wick right here which of course i do because i always have a fresh wig and let's go ahead and shake that up and i'm so excited you have no idea okay i'm not smelling it yet let me turn this up okay fresh wig and i'm dripping and i'm pulsing and i'm dripping and i'm posting oh i'm smelling it i'm smelling it oh my god i'm so excited this is like one of the these are definitely like on my top list to try because of that blueberry just because of the blueberry that's what's getting me to try this so here we go banana cream pie again that's what the bottle looks like and let's give it a big this is definitely like a banana cream pie on a graham cracker crust that's what it tastes like to me it's got definitely that graham cracker crust it's giving me a natural not a candy banana um it's not a heavy banana but the mixture it just works really really well together i like that a lot that graham crust really really gives it more flavor i thought that it was going to be like i'm getting so vaped out in here i thought that it was going to be more of just like a regular crust but it's a graham crust that makes it makes the flavor even better i really like this they did it to me again this is really really good yum yum okay so now on to the sugar cookie and again 70 30 vgpg and i have my three milligrams of nicotine and i have a fresh wig excited i've been dying to try this sugar cookie as a matter of fact i wanted to try to diy it before i even got it because i love sugar cookies now the only thing is is that depending on the amount of cinnamon in it is if i can actually vape it because for a long period of time usually with cinnamon vapes i can't really vape cinnamon vapes often because i actually have an allergic reaction in my mouth from cinnamon vapes but i found that if i just take a little by little like you know i'll have a little bit today just like a few puffs and then maybe tomorrow i didn't do it that way but i can't vape it all day because that's when i get the reaction so i worked around it so here we go i'm gonna go ahead and drip on here of course another fresh wick i smell cookie oh my god you don't understand when i see cookies i smell cookies i'm like i'm your best friend like if you want me you want to get to my heart just give me cookies so there we go i'm gonna go ahead and put the cap on okay got the cap on got that turned up and let's have a vape this tastes like a warm cookie that just came out of the oven fresh and buttery and just oh so the cinnamon is very light on it but it is there you can tell that it's got cinnamon but it's not an overwhelming cinnamon that cookie comes through so buttery so warm so almost crispy i can imagine it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside absolute glass never let me i'm telling you i wish i had stock in the company and that's all i'm saying that is a really really good sugar cookie it's a cinnamon sugar or cinnamon glazed sugar cookie it just tastes so good it really does that is a good sugar cookie if you like sugar cookie and you can vape cinnamon i guarantee you you will like this definitely definitely a must try along with our blueberry cake just saying but anyway just for this for this review it's just the sugar cookie and it's the banana cream pie and both of them literally blew my my mind they really did oh my god if i was to tell you which one's my favorite just out of these two i would probably go with the sugar cookie first i love the banana cream pie but like if i had to grab one i'd probably grab the sugar cookie before that especially if i could vape cinnamon all day long this would be my all day vape absolutely amazing this one i like a little bit better because i can literally envision a warm cookie coming out of the oven and i love love love warm cookies i really do and you can taste like the butteriness and you can taste the sugar on it and you can taste the cinnamon i'm not really getting a glaze i'm getting more of a sugar um like sweet sugar but it's lingering it's lingering it's really really good so yeah so that was the glass basics sugar cookie and um banana cream pie let me know your thoughts down below have you tried either of these and if you have which was your favorite and if you haven't and tried both have you tried either one of them let me know down in the comments and also tell me what your favorite e-liquid is like favorite brand and name of it i would love to know your thoughts down below and i will see you in the next one bye", "F1_v78p9e_A": "hi everybody I'm will welcome back to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some weed milkshakes buckle up and we're gonna go on quite a ride etc so in order to start we've got to make some canna milk which is a pretty simple process you don't really need to deke are peer were you to click other recipes because it's gonna be simmering with the milk for like 3 hours the weed will activate over time by itself ok let's get started first we've gotta fill our pot up about halfway with water like so and then we have to put this bowl on top of the pot and this will create a sort of double boiler because we want to be really careful with our milk while it's being prepared so we're gonna need 4 cups of whole milk remember it has to be hold because the weed won't gone to a low-fat milk well it all really careful and just pour it in then we're gonna use about 2 cups of cream which is equivalent to this container and that's just gonna increase the fat level so the weed will bond even better [Music] awesome so we've got a quarter ounce of weed right here remember it doesn't really need to be carved you can just kind of pour it in there now we're going to leave our bowl here and we're gonna bring our pot over to the oven so we're just gonna leave our stove on high and wait for it to boil okay so now we're gonna play named the strain basically I'm gonna list a bunch of different strains and you're gonna have to figure out which one is real and which are fake and then at the end of that pisode we'll reveal our answers The Simpsons Bob saggin mile-high club the Philadelphia Experiment old mother now you've gotta stay tuned to find out what the real ones were that's how we trap you all right so now our water is finally boiling and we're gonna bring it down to a lower level to simmer and we're gonna go get our weed milk just place it on top to create our makeshift double boiler it'll be simmering for about three hours but you want to make sure to keep checking back on it and stirring it it's pretty viscous and just lots of weed chunks everywhere making a nice whirlpool so if you're waiting around for your chamomile to finish you might try a banana and get of potassium fix before your poison [Music] yellows my favorite color since it takes forever to make the can of milk we've got some already prepared and cooled down in our fridge so the milk still has a bunch of little wheat bits in it so we have to strain it through a cheesecloth [Music] we're done with our cheesecloth so we're just gonna put it in the sink so now we're gonna put some of our kena milk into the blender for a milkshake it's really strong though so you only really need like half a cup I don't believe I've ever actually had can of milk in the past but I could very well make some for myself in the future now we're just gonna get our ice cream from the freezer [Music] we're going to put about 3 cups of ice cream into our blender my favorite flavor is vanilla but I'll survive with this I guess it's a little stuck that's okay now we're gonna blend our can of milk and ice cream together it's you a milkshake consistency [Music] cool now it's time for a weed fact weed is actually in the same plant family as hops which is a key ingredient in beer hops actually has a mild sedative effect just like weed and so people used to put it in their pillows that night to help them sleep we're gonna just deck out our glass for aesthetic purposes we've got marshmallows chocolate chips Oreo strawberries pretzels Twizzlers leaves Kit Kats straws the blue is pretty divine I think we're gonna put our chocolate chips in the microwave for about like a minute and a half and until they're just like melted very finely [Music] okay okay so now our chocolate chips are almost melted now we're gonna stir our melted chocolate chips into a saucy consistency we're gonna give her a glass nice rim job and just there we go it's a little sloppy but I'm sure it'll taste pretty delicious anyway now we're just gonna chop up an Oreo to add to that we're just gonna sprinkle this into the chocolate bowl to just add another layer of deliciousness rim again this time with Oreos next we're gonna slice the strawberry up to put on the rim you just want to cut it like two-thirds through so it's split but not in half strawberries are definitely my favorite just because I'm an organic [ __ ] I guess so you just want to gently place them around the rim of the glass we're just gonna let that chill there I guess so now it's finally time to add our milkshake Wow now we're gonna get some whipped cream from the fridge get it in there I really like as much whipped cream as possible you could totally stop at this point but I like going the extra mile so we're gonna add some Twizzlers it's overflowing a bit but I like it now some KitKat bars and for health reasons just a little bit of mint and finally a pretzel on the head now we've got a crazy straw we're gonna stick a marshmallow through and tada it looks amazing but I might not live very long it's a lot of work to get to this point but I think it was worth it [Music] now it's time to reveal which traits are real and which are fake The Simpsons is real Bob Saget is real mile-high club is fake the Philadelphia Experiment is fake old mother is real Congrats I knew you guys could figure it out Wow it's a chocolate explosion I'm overwhelmed with flavor [Music] if you want my opinion I'd say this is totally worth the early grave well we're all done thank you for joining me in this amazing chocolate weed milkshake adventure until next time I'm will bye-bye", "Ha8Eej6E7i8": "hey guys and welcome back to the channel today on this redline vlog style video i've got the newest member of the volkswagen suv family that's right that is the 2020 volkswagen atlas cross sport now the last time i drove this thing i was in vancouver it was about earlier this year right before the pandemic started as you can see this is an sel with the r line sport appearance package designed to be a competitor to things like the ford edge a jeep grand cherokee a honda passport the upcoming toyota venza it essentially takes the very successful 303 row atlas and shortens it creating a two-row version and kind of gives it a cupified look to kind of make it resemble like an audi q8 or a lamborghini earth so the big question i want to answer is the new atlas cross sport the perfect family vehicle for today's modern family that's over here to find out [Music] so just like the regular three row atlas the cross sport has the newer front fascia which actually volkswagen just put this new fascia on the 2021 atlas so stay tuned for my full review on that video called a later date but as you can see compared to the last one that i drove in vancouver which was a boring silver color this is a very pretty shade of kind of like a greenish blue tint this is the sel with the r line package it's not the full sel premium but you get full led headlights no led fog lights instead you kind of have this sculpted front fascia with a deeper uh blacked out painted lower air dam and you get more of that chrome trim this kind of very subtle r-line badge and this is a very big vehicle remember it goes head-to-head with cars like the honda passport the ford edge the chevrolet blazer and compared to the regular atlas this is about three inches shorter but at 195 inches long overall this is still on the bigger end it's about five inches longer than something like the honda passport now because this one has the r-line sport package you get these 21 inch wheels wrapped in two 65 with tires these are one of the largest wheels that you can get in the industry and just like the regular atlas you still get a fairly decent amount of ground clearance around eight inches total and it shares the same 117 inch long wheelbase obviously when you get back here you can see it's got that sloping coupe like look kind of reminds you of an audi q8 or a porsche cayenne coupe which is also a really stylish looking vehicle now the tail light modules just like the regular atlas are kind of an led combination but they do look slightly different this is the most differentiating angle between this and the regular atlas you have these fake chrome exhaust trim pieces vw and audi have been very guilty of that as well this particular one here also has the towing package which can tell a maximum of 5000 pounds and because it's an suv the trunk capacity is huge you can see with the seats up which this doesn't offer a third row my dog cedar happily kind of jumped right in you get 40.1 cubic feet of space and if you fold down everything you get around 78 cubic feet of space and you also get a very happy puppy now of course on the inside of the atlas cross sport if you guys are pretty familiar with the atlas interior and a lot of other newer volkswagen interiors it's going to look very familiar now first things first as you can see this is the sel with the r-line package it's got this really nice tan interior with the two-tone the seats are just heated if you want cooled seats you have to go for the sel premium which my tester is one notch below it shutting the door it has a relatively solid thunk that you associate with other german cars and this interior at a glance looks fairly nice however if i'm going to be honest here vw really needs to do something about the design of their interiors they just don't really have that wow factor that they used to have a few years ago i mean sure you've got the digital cockpit display over here which is very close to what you find in a lot of audis with their virtual cockpit you have an eight inch touchscreen over here that includes things like android auto and apple carplay it is a very nice easy to use system the screen is bright although i think that at eight inches it's starting to look a little bit small especially considering how expansive and large the dashboard is of this vehicle the materials here have some of that faux stitching with the leatherette there on the upper portion here the door panel here is also a soft touch injection molded plastic you've got some silver painted plastic and some imitation plastic which tries to look like carbon fiber the door handle here is metal at least and it's also slightly padded over here the window controls are one touch up and down for all four so that's all very nice stuff in here really the newest thing that you're gonna notice in the interior is this steering wheel it's the new volkswagen steering wheel with the new volkswagen emblem it definitely looks a lot slimmer a lot more modern it looks a little bit more luxury oriented as well i really like the emblem this is what you're going to start seeing trickle down into other volkswagen products the steering wheel itself tilts and telescopes offers a lot of adjustability and range which is very nice and then over here you can see the dashboard layout design is pretty similar to every other volkswagen that i've seen and i kind of think that's where vw could have done more to differentiate this car from other vehicles i like this little shelf over here where you can store stuff you've got dual zone climate control just heated seats no cooled seats on this particular one here there's a couple of empty buttons over there and then over here down here you can see there is a wireless phone charger two usb ports and then lots of controls over here for your drive mode selector this controls the eight speed automatic which by the way because i don't have the premium package i only have just a standard backup camera if you guys go for the sel premium package um you'll get the full 360 camera with the top down views your cup holders over here electronic parking brake and then of course nice big center core storage over here with a nice padded lid the lid itself however doesn't slide forward and back that's always typically been a volkswagen thing so that's weird to see it missing here the seats are also a little bit boring to look at but i do like the color i wish they were cooled on this trim but you got to step up one more notch and then they feel relatively good this is not a real leather this is the synthetic leather leather that volkswagen offers on the lower trims the premium package gives you a real leather and then the glove compartment here you can see there's two us sd card slots there for the gps it's not lined with felt but it is damped and then above me you can see panoramic roof is included on this trim which lets in a lot of light the back seats as you can see are huge let me show you guys that real quick and as you can see the back seat of the cross sport is actually larger versus the three row atlas because volkswagen said when they took out the third row in this vehicle they were able to kind of push the second row a little bit further back to give passengers more space vw says you get around 40 inches of legroom back here 40 inches and you have a nearly completely flat floor surprise there's actually a little shelf here where there should be something here maybe for like your climate control settings in other parts of the of the world two usb ports over there a household power outlet and then when you shut the door you can see it sounds pretty similar to the front this is a hard touch plastic material here on the upper door panels of the rear door so a little bit of cost cutting there two map pockets which is nice the seats themselves you can see they don't actually slide forward and back which would have been nice but they do offer a little bit of adjustability so you can kind of fold them forward or you can also recline them slightly which is good but i'm surprised that vw didn't allow me to actually slide the seat forward which would have been nice to uh to include on the two-row version so overall if you're looking for one of the largest back scenes in the segment the atlas cross sport definitely will satisfy that and really this is about as big as what you're going to find in the honda passport so the atlas cross sport is volkswagen's entry into the continuously growing two-row mid-size crossover second remember this is a segment for vehicle for people who think that the compact crossover like a tiguan or a rav4 or crv is too small because you want something with more space in the second row and the trunk and you potentially want a six cylinder engine most vehicles a lot of entries in this segment have a six cylinder a v6 or vr6 like this one and honestly when i first drove this car back in british columbia when i was in vancouver i was pretty impressed with it it's a relatively solid entry in the segment it's not the sportiest it's not the most luxurious it's not the sleekest looking but it covers a very nice middle ground volkswagen has priced it well and it also looks relatively handsome on the outside now the one that i tested in vancouver was a very boring silver with black interior but this one here in tourmaline blue with this beige interior combination is really nice this is how i would i would buy this car if i was going to look at one of these and the outside like i said um for 2021 vw is adjusting the regular atlas to have the same front fascia as this but unlike you know the passport and the pilot which have basically just a different grille and slightly different tail lights they look like exactly the same vehicle this however looks you know slightly more different to me i also think that the vw did a good job with the proportions of the rear even though i hate this sloping coupe design i think this particular one looks good at the back now regarding the interior vw has been heavily criticized by consumers and myself for being a little bit too safe on the interior and the cross sport is technically no exception to that rule either so the inside may not be super luxurious or full of all the latest tech it doesn't really wow you but it is comfortable it's easy to use it's also very quiet in here and this car has a really good ride quality despite the fact that it's on 21-inch wheels now a 2-liter turbo engine is the standard engine in the cross sport i actually haven't driven the 2-liter turbo i would probably skip it just because i don't like that engine in the tiguan but it is tuned to make 235 horsepower in this most people who buy a cross sport will probably go for the vr6 and this is vw's 3.6 liter unit with 276 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque it goes out through an 8-speed automatic transmission this one has their hall decks based four motion all-wheel drive system and when you put the vehicle into its sport setting here and put your foot down this definitely has the grunt that i'm expecting for a vehicle that's in the midsize crossover segment i mean the tiguan um which is pretty big for a compact car is just ridiculously sluggish with the two liter this 3.6 has a very nice snarl to it it's very smooth it's very refined it's not the quickest in the segment cars like the honda passport will be faster the subaru outback turbo will be faster the chevrolet blazer with its 3.6 is faster this feels pretty comparable to the last grand cherokee with the 3.6 liter pentastar engine that i drove i also like this has a traditional stepped automatic so for those of you who hate cvts this is going to be a really nice option for you it feels like it gets to 60 in the mid 7 second range which is adequate performance um it's got plenty of power for most people i actually thought it felt underpowered when i was in vancouver now that i have the car back at home at sea level where it's not we're not at elevation i find the power to be adequate um do i wish it had a little bit more power sure do i wish that the crossbar was a little sportier to drive sure absolutely i mean this car feels big and heavy it's very wide you really notice the width of this car which translates to a lot of interior space in the front you know between the two passengers at the back or the front here it's a very smooth refined car but there's a reason obviously why you know the audi q8 gets the turbocharged v6 because it has way more low end torque it feels a little bit more effortless this engine you know you kind of have to rev it out to feel a little bit of power but it's a good engine that you want to rev out that you know is very smooth and quiet so i don't really have a problem doing that the 8-speed automatic in this car also is very smooth it shifts perfectly fine it's very competitive with the segment it's not you know one of the best transmissions in the business but it's a transmission that will just kind of you know fade and fade into the background as you drive this thing daily so i think that's really important uh when you're talking about a daily driver really the cross sport is so middle of the road just good at everything that i have trouble finding faults with this thing i mean sure i could complain about it being boring on uh to drive i can complain about the interior not having that wow factor but really volkswagen knows you know their target audience with this thing and for the people who are looking for a family car that has way more space than most of the competition this is going to do very nicely in that regard now if you guys were planning to actually tow use that 5000 pound towing capacity i would be concerned that this v6 doesn't quite have the grunt but like i said for most everyday usages you get it up to highway speeds it has a very soft controlled ride quality it's very quiet in here this would be a really excellent road trip car just from the sheer amount of space that it has really where i think vw needs to work on is the fuel efficiency for this engine it is rated at 16 in the city and 22 on the highway which in my week's worth of testing i have been averaging around 17 mpg which is not great um on the highway i did get this up to about 23 mpg so it will do a little bit better than the actual epa numbers which seems a little bit conservative to me but you know with the turbocharged engines that everyone's going to in the competition set vw does need to work on the fuel economy and make this thing better it is a product of the fact that this is a heavy car this weighs you know a little over 4 500 pounds so it is pretty heavy and it feels heavy when you're driving it but that heft translates into you know feeling of safety a feeling of quality so i think there's a reason why uh vw did that so overall if you like the way the atlas drives this drives the same way it doesn't feel any smaller to me or any sportier but it's just as every bit as comfortable it's just as quiet it's every bit as smooth and it's also different you don't see you know that many of these on the road like you would see at an edge or in grand cherokee and let's be honest here i don't really particularly like the way the current edge drives i also don't really like the way the grand cherokee drives with the v6 you got to go for the v8 if you want the grand cherokee and then there's the passport of course which i think the passport has a transmission that i don't love the nine-speed auto is not good and then of course the nissan murano is another option which the murano is a very smooth driving car but a lot of you you know hate the cvt and i also am not fans of the looks of the current generation so the crossport definitely has enough high points in here to warrant a look if you guys are looking for something like this size so the 2020 volkswagen atlas crossport may not be the sportiest vehicle in the segment to drive that's not its mission of this car you can't deny how ridiculously practical the atlas cross sport is just like the three row atlas the cross sport offers a lot of space in the second row and the cargo area and the front seats because it's the same width and rides on the same wheelbase it being three inches shorter does give this car a slightly different look in fact unlike the honda passport which always constantly reminds you that it's a pilot uh the crossboard definitely has a unique look at the rear now of course the front will remind you of the regular three row atlas but i think that vw did a good job with making this thing look a little bit more standoutish especially the r-line package that gives you the 21-inch wheels this tourmaline blue exterior color and just the sloping rear roof line of the rear area it reminds me a lot of the lamborghini eras and the audi q8 and keep in mind this is about half the price of something like the audi q8 now of course the cross sport isn't perfect i wish that the interior looked a little bit more special to kind of match the premium look on the outside and i also think that this one here at 46 000 should be the fully loaded version i don't like how i have to go to a premium package to get things like the real leather and the ventilated seats which will push the price a little over 50 000 but this car starts at around 31 550 which is about a thousand dollars more versus the three-row atlas it represents a good deal and it's going to be less expensive versus cars like the jeep grand cherokee and the ford edge but keep in mind that the hyundai santa fe and subaru outback which are smaller vehicles will be less expensive versus this fully loaded atlas but with all that said i hope you guys have enjoyed my full overview on this 2020 atlas cross board with the six cylinder engine if you're also looking to see the latest cars i'm testing be sure to follow me on instagram redline

the next video", "4lLn0PhkakM": "[Music] [Music] hey guys mr. and mrs. Smith here and today we're going to be reviewing the heavy hitters cannabis infused gummies we have strawberry pineapple to try today we're actually very excited to try these uh if you don't know already heavy-hitters is possibly our favorite brand I would definitely say I would say it's also primarily smoke heavy hitters for our everyday cartridge and then when we want to like it up a little bit we'll grab some other stuff but heavy hitters is definitely always on a cartridge for us so we're also going to be trying the heavy hares GSC I say trying we've had it many times but we haven't been able to find it for a while not what you are it kind of it kind of went out of stock just weird it used to be available a lot in like 2018 but it kind of just fell out of favor except for certain places would still carry a guy in town by our main delivery service was no longer carrying it but they had it the other day so I had to pick it up cause it's been too long it seems like they almost haven't had it in stock since the name change so JSC used to be Girl Scout cookies I don't know if they changed it in others stances I'm pretty sure it was part of the laws that happened I'm pretty sure it's part of the laws that happened in 2018 for California that's they weren't allowed to call it they can't call it candy I believe they can't use the term candy and they can't use the term anything that could be marketed yes towards children can't market towards children right Paul any so that's why it says gummies or it'll always seem medical or cannabis like that they never never make yeah that would be appealing to a child exactly it can't be bears or anything like that so I mean it's a good law honestly I totally understand why there's some other laws that happened in 2018 which I will give you a refresher on right now now there was some weird stuff that happened when California passed a recreational marijuana back in 2018 I believe it was one of the things that happen is towards the middle of the year they actually switched it to where edibles could no longer contain more than a hundred milligrams per package now if you work in the medical marijuana industry or if you were a user or anything like that prior you know that there used to be packages up to a thousand milligrams in just one treat and what that used to be really good at is you could like just take a nibble off of a treat throughout the day and just kind of keep yourself dosed and medicated off one treat for a whole week basically but they changed it because there were way too many people who would come into a dispensary have no idea what they were doing by one of those really high potency edibles eat the whole thing and then they have a really bad time and end up going to the emergency room they got sick of dealing with that so they made a law saying you can't have more than a hundred milligrams per package there are certain things you can get around that such as cannabutter tinctures and pills those three items you can definitely get in higher doses than 100 milligrams but for edibles and then kind of cookie or anything like that max you're gonna get in a package is about a hundred so today we're reviewing B's from heavy hitters and the way they went about with these twenty milligrams per piece is you can actually rip the pieces in half so it's actually two servings per piece so it actually comes in two to ten milligram servings which I'm pretty sure is the law is that each piece inside a package can only be ten milligrams or something like that I know five to ten milligrams is a state recommended serving I'm not a hundred percent clear on the laws but it's just an unfortunate thing that happened with edibles in 2018 but I am absolutely dying to try these guns so let's go ahead and open up to the [ __ ] strawberry cuz I'm Joey it's been it's been a long time looking for out that let me grab the a7 r3 with the 70s [Music] [Music] yeah we just won't have us we won't help you all this video it's just not working at the moment six and a half hours Nathan I might open the pineapple real quick to maybe these do not open well I feel like we should show just how much of a struggle these were to open just like a montage of the [ __ ] difficulty this is bad this one opened much easier but that first package it just ripped in such a way that it was really hard to open but this is just like the other one has a really strong smell I figured it's it's really strong artificial pineapple mmm it's it's kind of a a bit herbal but not like too herbal it's not like overly pungent or anything like that like you're not gonna have you're not gonna get in trouble they're just keeping these in your drawer or anything like that like no one's gonna smell it yeah I don't know if this has any actual like pineapple juice or anything in it it doesn't have it listed on the ingredients mm-hmm so we're not sure if this is artificial flavoring or real bad no artificial actual coloring and flavor so is that natural flavors that display really use the natural coloring and flavor like or is it a flavor that's kind of that's kind of weird I don't know if I feel someone from heavy Harry's modified food yeah I don't mind it I mean that's just what I mean the people are heavy hitters you might want to put that it is natural flavoring as well like actually specified natural color and natural flavoring because natural color and flavoring just sounds a bit odd it's it leaves it up to the imagination as to is the flavoring also natural or just natural color you're always a nice flavoring this yeah always alright so let's try the pineapple yeah I'm gonna do a full 20 but I'm gonna show the camera how it splits so this is the gummies from heavy-hitters it's a square and if you look very carefully there's this little seam in the middle that if you pull whoops it starts to come apart yes it does if you start to pull it comes apart very nicely into two perfectly even ten milligram pieces so let's start well I'm actually just gonna eat the whole thing at once wait so where's our list of like criteria so I know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing bring it up go on top down your mouth and just roll around a little okay yeah my hands are all sticky now you know I gotta say I'm a little disappointed I'm a little underwhelmed actually I had I had much higher hopes it could just be the pineapple yeah because I mean the strawberry definitely smells better than the pineapple the pineapple is a little strong it's kind of it's very herbal forward which isn't a bad thing a lot of people enjoy that it's not a bad flavor necessarily but it is definitely herbal forward if you're looking for something that you could just totally mound shun and forget that there's weed in it not that we recommend it's not gonna be that yeah definitely don't recommend that but I mean like if you're if you're a fan of someone who like Eric or someone who likes really really flavorful very liked gummies that don't aren't bitter or plant alike at all this is not for you this is made to be strong and to be potent and it definitely tastes like it so keep that in mind and next up we have the strawberry so let's go ahead and pop these open and yeah will rate them in a second let's try the strawberry and I want to go ahead and split this one yeah because there'll be 30 milligrams each mmm much better much better mm-hmm all right strawberry is actually really good um I would say it's definitely pretty it is still has that herbal flavor but um let me bring up the criteria so we can actually start to break these down aftertaste yeah yeah really bad yeah I would say it's a bit odd I I'm almost feeling a little bit um disappointed I know me too it which it sucks because I'm such a fan of their oils but that's where comes in would we be as disappointed if we hadn't hyping it up so much yeah we did we we've also we've held on to these for about two weeks we've been waiting and waiting and waiting to try these specifically for the on camera experience and you know I think that also kind of built it up the fact that we've been we've been like dying sitting on me dying to try them the whole time and I mean they're they're good [ __ ] effects for sure by new user mm-hmm will probably like would probably really like it however its strong grams each heavy hitters recommends 10 milligrams as a dose the state of California recommends that california recommends that I personally have very low tolerance when it comes to most things so if you're like me I would definitely recommend starting with 5 milligrams when it comes to edibles but I mean you've been doing it you've been using medical using marijuana medically for two years yes so her tolerance is pretty high so we can handle the 30 we just say no problem but the big thing is though from let's let's go ahead and actually break this down but the main thing that I'm getting from these is but from trying both of them it is quite herbal forward the the flavor is there the strawberry is much sweeter and more flavorful I would say than the pineapple pineapple is a little more herbal forward as well but let's actually start talking about our rating categories here and give these are actually solid score each [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we're also gonna open this GSC previously known as Girl Scout cookies for those of you have been in the game a little longer and actually know the OG strings we're gonna be trying that card out today so anyways hope to catch you all later and see you in the next video like and subscribe [Music]", "v6fgHX6u6K4": "[Music] and the fruit loop one [Music] how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new new layer what's up guys welcome back for those of you who are new to this channel my name is elena welcome and for those of you who are already subscribed welcome back um we're going to be doing a video on how to infuse cereal so we're going to be doing it with both tincture and with butter this will work on pretty much any type of cereal i'm going to be showing you guys or like demonstrating it on these three these are just these props um but yeah it'll work it'll work on all of them so let's start with the tincture um because that one is a little bit more simple so i just have a pan here with some parchment paper or wax paper parchment i guess and let's do some of the cinnamon toast crunch [Music] i'm just gonna do a little bit because i already have some of these made and it's not difficult to make more as i need it [Music] and then let's also use this one [Music] which we never had this in canada for the longest time it was only in the states and then we got here and i honestly wanted to try so bad i was so excited for it before it came to canada and when i tried it i'm just like it's not that exciting like [Music] the crunchies don't taste different like so the berries don't taste different than the cap'n crunch crunches dude you know what i mean like it just like tastes the same i really want to try the cotton candy one how is that one we definitely don't have that here i remember in the states you guys had cotton candy oreos back in 2015 because i was there and i bought some of them and they were like the best oreos i've ever had hopefully they'll come back one day okay so starting with the tincture we have our um captain crunch and our cinnamon toast crunch and this would all be easier being done in something like this because partly through this we're going to need to like turn it over and it helps having in here because you can kind of just like shake it and move it around um but the problem is that i personally only have this type of size of one and i want to keep them um like as spacious as possible so i can get um as much airflow so if you have a bigger one of these that would work well or if you're just doing a small batch okay so um so i already put some of my tincture in a little spray bottle i ordered these on amazon um i'll put a link for something similar but you can use this i'm just like one from the dollar store any type of spray bottle or even those little um like ones that are made for olive oil that kind of mist when you repetitively press them um i've used those as well but kind of like this better surprisingly um yeah so i just poured my tincture into a bottle now i'm gonna spray my cereal with my tincture and then see and this is where it's tricky because you have to flip it around and like you can do it one by one which is really easy for the cinnamon toast crunches especially because they're easy to just grab and turn around but that's a lot of work for doing like larger batches but yeah you could just like shake it flip it with a [Music] flippy a cookie a spatula and then i'm just going to turn these over like this [Music] okay so i think it's actually best to spray them close together so that nothing goes on the paper and it mostly goes on the cereal so then we'll now that we've turned them we're going to spray them some more and you can use as much or as little as you want i mean if you're going to add a lot a lot i would definitely um let them dry in between so we're gonna do that anyway so now that like we have them sprayed i'm gonna spread them out so they have good airflow and then we're going to let this dry um and the alcohol will dry pretty fast especially if you have um moving air wherever you are don't put in the fridge something you want to leave it's an open area so the alcohol can evaporate so then we're just going to leave this until they are pretty dry and then we can spray them some more so we can keep repeating this step until i mean you can repeat as much as you want um it's really that easy no need to put them in like the oven or anything like that so that's how you make them a tincture now we're gonna make them with some butter so we're gonna start by melting some butter i am going to be using a microwave you don't have to you can use a double boiler because every time i use a microwave in my videos i get a million people saying not to use a microwave and i just shouldn't use a microwave but i like using the microwave and i've still had good results like yeah maybe if i use the microwave and everything turns out really weak then maybe i wouldn't use it but then maybe i'm wrong maybe using the microwave um is making them weaker and maybe stronger if i didn't use it uh but i don't really see how the microwave would make a difference i don't see heating it up using the microwave versus anadele boiler would make a difference like i don't really i don't get it so somebody wants to explain to me in the comments and give me like actually the proper explanation and not just like this is what i heard and this is why but like i don't know i'm not flipped it i just like i'm lazy [Music] so i like the microwave but i'm open to listening it's just i need some more solid proof before i change my lazy ways you know okay so i'm just cutting up some um these are this is the butter that i have in um they're in half a cup blocks and i don't want too much right now so i'm just cutting um one of mine into like [Music] so i'm going to go and take this maybe i do want a little bit more let's see how much cereal we're going to do so i'm going to be doing this one oh wait no i'm doing this one i'm gonna be mixing it in here and let's start with let's give the cinnamon toast crunch last because i think the cinnamon um coating is gonna get into the butter and we'll transfer onto the other cereal so let's do fruit loops first the colors on these are not as nice to me i feel like it's probably because they're like colored with like natural colors now or something yeah no artificial flavors of colors does it like that mistakes i feel like canada is like more strict with their regular food regulations just like a lot of stuff tastes better in the states [Music] so let's do it cheerios and then we'll do this one next but i'm gonna i'm gonna go microwave this microwave i'll be right back i'm just gonna sneak back in here and add this other half because i feel like we're gonna need it and i like my stuffed buttery okay so i melted it for about i don't know 40 seconds there's still a couple little chunks i'm just waiting for them to melt with the remaining heat in the butter and so i have my um fruit loops [Music] i'm just gonna pour some of this over and i'm gonna take some of my butter and just drizzle it over not all of it you can always add more right and i'm going to put a lid on this and shake it up sounds a little broken but i don't think they are so we put a little bit in there and we shook it up and i feel like we can add a little bit more so let's just drizzle a little more in there [Music] and shake it up again [Music] oh yeah that looks perfect [Music] sorry i just had a little photo shoot here for the thumbnail um uh yeah so i shut up my butter and um [Music] and those are all shaken up and good and actually this the butter kind of hardens a bit probably because i have the air conditioner on so well i'll show you so i have this tyrex container and i had already treated the oven to about 220 degrees i've done this at 200 degrees i've done it at 250 um i kind of just the results are pretty similar either way so then i'm going to pour that into my baking dish and you can see that the butter kind of hardened in here i'll show you [Music] like that so i'm gonna actually put this whole thing in the microwave just to melt kind of that so that i don't have to like scrape and eat it with the spoon by myself after because i don't want to waste it so yeah i'll just melt that down a bit okay so i melted a little bit of butter and now we're gonna do cinnamon toast crunch which is my favorite actually it's not my favorite i love lots of cereals [Music] and then we're going to pour some butter over it yeah see i did make a little bit too much butter but not that much maybe i'll make some popcorn after and pour that on okay and then i'm just gonna um i don't know well let me zoom in okay so i have my uh slimming tools crunch and my butter oh i'm probably screaming into the camera right now um and i'm just gonna pour that over just a little bit to start with and we're gonna shake that oh my god that was so close to spilling that i can't believe i actually saved that okay see you do this in a plastic bag whatever okay uh [Music] i feel oh this one's gonna taste so good with the butter i can already imagine i'm gonna add a little bit more just a little bit i can you guys know like what am i trying to say like have you ever had that chex mix type thing that's made with um butter in the oven and then it just has that i can't even explain how delicious this is going to be this city into a french one it's like this is what it's about like buttered bread buttered cinnamon bread okay so that's how it looks the lighting is kind of weird uh maybe i'll zoom in when it's on the in the pan i'm just gonna put that in there don't worry it's just me eating this getting my little raccoon fingers all over everything now see what should we use this for cause this is like a mix of like cinnamon sugar and butter i feel like this probably tastes good by itself yes that tastes good by itself oh that is tasty it kind of tastes like frosting but anyways we have our butter coated cereal and it kind of has like a uh textures like i don't know how you explain that let's see uh like a butter texture essentially um so i preheat the oven to [Music] 220 degrees like i said and i'm going to put this in there and we're gonna let it cook for about 10-15 minutes so let's go bring that with us from the kitchen [Music] so i'll turn the lights on and what do we have 220 [Music] and we're gonna put this in i'm going to set a timer for about 10 minutes and we're going to come back and flip so it looks like these have dried a bit but not fully um if you're more patient you can just do this for the day and just come back to it every like hour or so and just spray and then um let it dry and then just do that every hour so you can really layer it up but for the purpose of this video i'm just gonna spray it again here and like i said before you can repeat this process as many times as you like i'm just this is gonna be the last time i'm doing it just because um for the video [Music] although like probably off camera i'll probably spray some more but it just depends on how strong you want to be and this isn't a perfect dosing um method like this isn't like some fancy like exact dosage and like it's not guaranteed the same results every time um but it's just a nice way to kind of just have the little snacks on hand so we're just gonna leave this out to dry we're gonna do that so we can get some better air on it and then that is pretty much good to go once it's fully um crunchy again [Music] okay so 10 minute timer went off and bear with me because i have uh i'm doing this one hand here so i'm just gonna pull this out looking good smells good oh very cinnamony um okay and i'm just gonna like if you just had one flavor in here you could uh how do i say this like [Music] flip it you know what i mean but because i have two i want to keep them separated and this would work better if you had it in a bigger dish so that the heat could get to the more evenly these look like halloween colors that's not what fruit loops used to look like like where's the red ones is it isn't it because red food coloring is supposed to be really bad or it comes from like cockroaches or something i don't know it's like why are you bothered by eating a cockroach when people eat like meat they're just like what's the difference so put that back in and let's do another 10 minutes [Music] and then we will come see actually let's do 15 minutes again like it doesn't really matter usually i put this in the oven between anywhere between like 20 and 45 minutes um and just flip it every like 10 or 15 or so um just just try different types and see how you like it it tastes maybe a little bit different if you cook it for you know half an hour instead of 45 minutes or 20 minutes instead of 45 but you could just take um some out at 20 minutes and then takes about a half an hour and kind of just taste each one and see how you like it the best and you can kind of figure out what your favorite way to do it is um from just one round essentially okay 15 minutes is up so it's been there for a total of 25 minutes oh my god that smells so good like i'm pretty sure it's just the cinnamon stuff it smells good but it literally smells like pie something like that i don't know it's really good oh sorry camera i put that can i put that there so yeah we're just mixing that up i think maybe like 10 or a minute should be good so just throw that back in [Music] and then 10 more minutes [Music] okay now our 15 minutes is over i'm going to turn off the oven and pull these out i think these are good to go let's just bring them over i am just going to lay them out on the parchment paper just to dry i mean i'm sure they could dry in the dish as well but i feel like they'll dry a little bit better here yeah so you kind of have them mixed together [Music] the rest of that here so we're just gonna leave these out to dry i'm just gonna separate the pieces that shouldn't be in the piles there kind of annoying um yeah see there they're not like they're not fully dry but they're just about dry it's all ready oh let's try the fruit [Music] lips sorry yeah so just leave that to dry and then i don't know i think it'll be good in like half an hour and then you can pack them all up once they're fully dry and they are ready to use whether you eat them by themselves or were you for milkover obviously i'm interested in eating them by themselves they're really good but thank you guys so much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did um i feel like i need to get a new ending because i feel like i say the exact same thing every time i hope you guys like this video and [Music] thank you guys so much for watching i hope you like this video please let me know if you did don't forget to give it a thumbs up leave a comment tell me what your favorite cereal is and subscribe thank you guys so much i hope you have a wonderful day see you guys next time i'm back because i forgot to taste the tincture ones i guess because they're not fully dry but or are they okay they're pretty much dry they can dry out for a little bit longer um honestly like not as good as the butter because well you can still taste the alcohol in a little bit like it mostly evaporates but you can still taste it a little bit and butter is there anything you can add butter to that doesn't taste good like obviously not dumplings like adding butter fruits actually you know why adding butter to fruit like in the oven is good it's like apple crisp you know but the better one's better and crunchier and buddier okay that's all it tastes kind of like reminds me of pie [Music] because the butter [Music] and the frugal ones how does it taste so much better now like that butter just adds a whole new [Music] layer", "BVeNyeJ2f5s": "direct connection is made by MPT to serve all of our diverse communities and is made possible by the generous support of our members thank you live from Maryland public television this is direct connection with Jeff Salkin welcome to direct connection we are live tonight from the state's largest grower of medical marijuana these plants which it would be illegal to have outside of this building are the beginning of the growing process here at curio wellness joining us is Michael Braun fine curio CEO thanks for having us nice to come in Jeff first question is why am I wearing the bunny suit because this is a plant where we grow raw material to create medicine and so under FDA regimes it has to be hygienic we don't use any type of pesticides insecticides or any other crop control agent except or law of water and fertigation and people may hear this is a noisy environment it's the air purification it's bright LED lights tell me about the business this has been live for over a year now what's happened in that here it's been an exciting time and candidly a lot of time of great learning when you undertake a new disruptive industry you build a theoretical model about what you think it's going to be and then you create an actual operating plan and then you learn you've made plenty of mistakes and I've played it wrong in substance but you had some good ones also and and so we have evolved literally 180 degrees over this first year through a lean management system and some other techniques we use to the point where this is a very well oiled machine now where we're delivering large quantities a product every week with no defects and great customer satisfaction globally we got beyond your company what's happened to medical cannabis in over the last year or two I think it's become more more accepted as a true medicinal product and I think some of the historical negatives or things that people thought they were probably aided by the government with your Falls are starting to clear way so it's kind of dark clouds going away and interestingly the largest cohort of growth for us has been baby boomers and I suspect first of all they probably had some castle experience back in college but more importantly they got a lot of aches and pains and traditional medicines can sometimes be interactive in a way that's not very good and the medicinal cannabis plan is very safe it has very low interaction tolerance so it allows you to use it with many other things at low levels in a very effective way let's explain how the system works in Maryland designed by the legislature there are licenses for growers and retailers essentially and somebody in the middle what what do you have so there are three different licenses there is a cultivation license to grow the plants there is a processing or manufacturing license to create the product that is in some other form you extract the oil from the plant and then you turn it into other pills capsules like and then there's a retail distribution network those are the dispensaries we're fortunate to be one of seven companies that has all three licenses but our primary business is to enable the success of the dispensers across the state by giving them our products on a very regular and consistent basis you're a business guy trail of successful healthcare businesses private equity businesses so you didn't come into this I don't believe as a marijuana expert you've learned something about these plants the things behind us the big ones it looks like a topiary a sort of thing and then we have these little cuttings yes sir these came from that that's correct these are called mother plants we use a cloning process so that we could get the genetics from a particular strain exactly the same from crop the crop plant the plant so we have a proprietary process for picking seeds turning them into the best by winning out the weaker genetics through both growing and testing we have a lab here and then once we get to the prime prop if you will will use one of these mother plants for approximately four months the first thing we do with the new mother is we take cuttings and start creating the new baby that's going to become the next mother because these mothers have a useful life where the quality of the plant is determined by how many cuttings you click that as it gets older they diminish in quality so we focus on measuring certain cannabinoid content and other markers of health and yield and we try to maximize the life of the plant to optimize that yield let me remind our viewers if you have a question about medical cannabis shortly we're going to be talking to the head of the pharmacy the dispensing operation you can send us an email no phone calls tonight but send an email to live questions at mptv.org and we'll try to get your question answered during the program what's your competition like and and how do you do things differently than the rest of the market well one of a very few that are only dedicated to medicinal cannabis we are not in favor of nor do we want adult use because we think Maryland is a place where we can build an ecosystem in an industry that creates exportable intellectual property and products and we'd like to see that happen in fact we've just worked with the legislature on a new bill to allow for academic research here in Maryland and so most of the companies haven't made the investment in the pharmaceutical grade environment and equipment that we've had and they don't have people from big pharma like we have we're working with chemistry and drug discovery and such things there are some very fine companies out there and then there's some companies that really just want to grow cannabis because they think it's a good thing and they think they can make money doing it but they're not dedicated to the investment research and development that we are the trend is moving in the direction as you said of varying degrees of legalization whether recreational becomes law in Maryland at some point or not but federal law has changed Congress passed President signed a bill and I think it was a side item in the bill but it makes CBD and I get that letters mixed up that's correct but it basically legalizes CBD and hemp is that right it legalizes the CBD that's derived from him CBD could come from hemp or it could come from the cannabis plant they're both derivative of an original plant the hemp plant has very very low acid less than 0.03 percent THC the psychoactive agent that's in cannabis in if it were to qualify for his half and so now because of the farm bill which what you're referring to people will be able to on a state-by-state basis decide what level of participation the Hef market they want so they've kind of maybe the state's Rights Act but with a pure go-ahead from the federal government CBD is the stuff that gets all the press lately does it affect your business model if somebody without all of this investment overhead it can grow acres of hemp and refined CBD out of it less expensively potentially yes and no it really doesn't because in our case we could grow at very low costs and in addition we have to have certain levels of purity and we don't know yet if hemp can deliver that because we've never work with it but we know we can get it from cannabis so we now a full flower or hygienic cultivation chambers we call them that's filled with a 18 to 1 CBD to THC ratio plant which we use for our CBD products ultimately I think if it is available and it's pure we'll buy it as a raw material just like we buy other raw materials that we don't create on our own first question in my email how can somebody invest in this industry your privately held but not everybody is there is a about 30 or 40 new

CBS CBS CBS [Music] back live at curieux wellness at an undisclosed location in Baltimore County I'm joined by Brian sanderoff who runs the side of the business that sells things to people how do you describe what you do over there so on the general manager and the clinical director of the dispensary so my job is to make sure that one we're helping patients making sure that they're getting the right products the right way counsel patients all day long also make sure that we're living up to all of the regulatory requirements that we don't do anything wrong what's the last year they've been like for you it's been a whirlwind it's just unbelievable so our dispensary has been open for about 10 months 11 months now and it's just been fantastic surprise after surprise every day I get up excited to go to work seeing what I'm going to learn let me ask you a slightly skeptical question which is what I do I mean clearly a lot of people are being helped by this but you also read increasingly about people smoking this stuff psychoses impaired driving how do you think about the balance between taking the good stuff and and people maybe not knowing what to do with the dangerous parts so the way that I approach to this is that I want people to be able to use this in a guided way and using it in an unguided way it's much more likely to cause problems than if you're using it guided properly so that plant contains hundreds of bioactive compounds and matching the right ones to the right person with the right condition is how you eliminate or real you know lower the chance of having problems the intermediate step that Michael was talking about between grow these things and sell this stuff which we'll talk about right describe the functionality there how does it work and and how is it evolving it's amazing the way it's evolving and especially the way that we occur you go after it making sure that what we're making is reliable it's repeatable we know it's going to be effective for people more like a pharmaceutical than it is an herb more the science than the art of using this medicine we we mind the research we do some research on our own we put together products that we think are going to be effective we test them alright we haven't we haven't talked about this stuff before but but I'll ask it in terms of the most common complaints that people walk in the door with and and how some of this may be able to help me Payne definitely I can't tell you how many patients I have who are no longer on opioids where they were six months ago a year ago sleep is a big issue a lot of autoimmune diseases things like ms neurological problems like Parkinson's or ALS anxiety all right so what might you yeah a whole variety of products that are available here in all sorts of different forms so this is a container that would actually contain the flour the raw flour that someone would grind down and then either smoke or consume with the vaporizer these are packages for the actual vapes that we have and so this is an oil that someone would attach to a battery and vaporize that there are pre-rolled cannabis products I'm sorry we used to call these joints now they're called free rolls right or there's all sorts of ways to consume the medicine in a different way so this is a tincture that somebody would put underneath their tongue and it would absorb through the mucosa in their mouth there's some advantages to doing it that way one of the things as a pharmacist I love about that is that I can be very very specific with the dosage that I'm giving somebody there are topicals there are all sorts of concoctions that people use viewer writes in and says you mentioned not being completely supportive of recreational abuse can you elaborate on that so as I said I want people and it's funny because I don't even think in terms of adult use versus medical anymore I just think in terms of guided versus unguided and what I want to do is make sure that people are using this medicine in the most appropriate way for them and there could be lots of ways that it may be used inappropriately maybe there's interactions with prescription medicines that they're on maybe the combination of cannabinoids that someone uses isn't really good for someone that has anxiety and so I just want people to use it in a guided way how good is the data that the guidance is based on it gets to this email from a viewer for adults over 50 who need to manage pain are there long-term studies concerning short and long term memory loss so yes there are although I have to say that a lot of the studies don't come from the United States because of the constraints that have been put on cannabis here in the in the United States it's been difficult for institutions to do the kind of studies that we're used to but we can look to Israel we can look to Europe we can look to Canada where they've been doing studies and there are the short-term memory thing is completely manageable if we're using the right combination of medicine and if it were to happen to somebody when they stopped using the medicine that problem has a tendency to go away but I can tell you with 11 months of clinical experience I have not seen that problem how does it work in Maryland the nuts and bolts of it somebody can't just walk in off the street to your office and walk out with something correct so the step one is they have to become registered they do that online they go to the MMC C which is the Maryland medical cannabis commission website click on the button for patients and you upload some information and then you become registered that process right now is taking somewhere between two and four weeks assuming all those things are correct you'll get a 16 digit number that starts with the letter P for patient step two is then to become a certified patient which means you have to go to a prescriber or a recommender who will certify that you are a valid patient for using cannabis once that done then you can go into a dispensary and get medicine there was a pretty liberal definition of who the prescribers can be here right you don't have to be an MD well so you could be an MD you can be a nurse practitioner you could be a podiatrist or a dentist if I if I had that correct they all have to be able to prescribe controlled substances right now so you have to have a c.d.s license to be able to recommend this okay viewer wants to know can medical cabinet cannabis alleviate pain from Lyme disease have you seen Lyman I've had several patients that I can think of right away that have had success with that so it's not necessarily the Lyme that it's treating it's the pain part of that cannabis has shown to be has been shown to be anti-inflammatory very very helpful for pain well let's see the question about him and I asked Michael about this this earlier the federal government basically legalizing CBD through the hemp channel that's on that we use it we sell it to our patients they don't have to be members or registered within the Commission to be able to use it basically you can get it over the counter okay see so you can sell some stuff to people who are not registered that's correct so hemp Durai of CBD doesn't really have THC in it and can be very effective although I'll tell you that clinically most of us feel that CBD with at least a little bit of THC is more effective than CBD by itself okay all those letters confuse me a little bit THC is the stuff that people who are into recreationally that's the that's the one where you can feel some euphoria from where has CBD been tested I mean what do we actually know about it other than it's hot at the moment well it has been tested and we do see results with pain for anxiety for energy helping with sleep if that sleep problem is related more to anxiety and pain muscle relaxation seizures immune function all of those issues or conditions have been shown to be helped by CBD CBD from hemp hemp is sort of like a cousin of cannabis so it supplies the CBD which is another can happen I didn't by the way there's I think they've discovered over a hundred different cannabinoids now and so when you and I have this discussion in a year and then another year we'll we'll know so much more how often do people consult dr. Google before they they come see you in other words how much how much research are our people doing how accurate is the stuff that people find online about these products I'd say the accuracy is about the same as in regular medicine when people consult doctor Google you can find some good information and some bad information that's why people come to us that's why I'd like to see people use it in a guided way and use it that guidance from a health professional who understands biochemistry potential interactions with other medicines that someone might be using I would say that a lot of my patients especially the sort of cannabis naive patients they haven't done any research they've heard about it either from their doctor or from a neighbor they get certified and then they come in and then they rely on us to help educate them what's happening in the medical community so you were a long-term licensed pharmacist do you think the establishment the medical establishment is becoming more favorable not to what degree what do you think what do you see yeah there's sort of three camps out there and there's the ones who are the adopters who understand it who see results with their patients and like it there's that camp that says I'm not sure I don't know about it and then there's a camp that says no you can't use it or you shouldn't use it and so I'd say it's changing and it's it's shifting and probably this shift is most responsible for that shift is patients coming in telling their doctors that they're getting results very good Brian sanderoff curio Wellness thank you for

curio wellness Michael Braun fine is the CEO here how many are standing next to a lovely plant by the way how many how many folks have you hired in starting this up so far we've had 105 people and I'm proud to say that over the course of the first 18 months 18 of them have been promoted from an entry-level job to a mid manager from amid to a higher level and we instituted once we passed over break-even a living wage so our minimum wage in this building is $15 what are most of those folks doing I know there's a big production operation here yes what are most of the jobs like so there's really kind of semi skilled and highly skilled so 70 school would be people that do horticulture preparation pruning planning all the things required to tender to the plants and then the trimming curing and packaging lumber those take various levels the skill sets that we've developed trading programs and best practices around all those on the manufacturing side we have chemists we have pharmacologists we have people who are involved in analytical work and so there's a number of advanced degree people who are doing drug discovery formulation and then we have a manufacturing team who takes the oil that we create they purify they separate it and then they create recipes and we create products where do you think there might be misconceptions among regulators among your fellow business people among members of the public about just what has happened since this might live in Maryland and and what the business is all about I think probably the first misconception is that people don't appreciate the level of quality the maryland program has we have an excellent testing protocol here so the public is getting very safe product no medals no pesticides no contaminants of all and and all of us all the growers in this state have to abide by a very very strict regulatory regime for hygienic quality so we're providing cannabis and cannabis derived products that are highly pure where can people get more information well they can go to our website curie wellness.com they can go to the maryland medical cannabis commissioner by the way we call it cannabis not marijuana it's its proper name so well I say can I say marijuana sometimes so people understand what I'm talking about we're trying to change the conversation that's a lot of part of what our strategy's about it talking about science and facts as opposed to other things so but the the Maryland medical cannabis commission website is also a good spot very good Michael Brown find CEO here thanks for the time

wants to warn parents that these marijuana infused treats could easily be confused by kids for the real thing Marcus solace has a story police admit it wasn't the arrest of the century an alleged low-level marijuana dealer busted in Tarrytown this week but it's more than buds that were seized there's THC in liquid form attachments for e-cigarettes and what's most troubling for the police chief edibles in the form of gummy candy I feel very strong that there is no need to put it in the form of something that's very attractive all to young children Chief John barber Len says the issue isn't whether recreational use of marijuana should be legal in New York as it is in several states and most recently in Canada his concern is the marketing of certain products containing THC there's two issues here hey is it an attraction to younger people that really shouldn't be making that decision and B what is the possibility of accidental exposure the chief points to a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found in Colorado the number of children hospitalized due to accidental exposure jumped 34% so could the sugary stuff be mistaken for something harder the similarities are striking down to the same shape and coloring of the products so if I was to put this on my counter with my ten-year-old daughter home what's to say she's not gonna pick it up and he didn't think it's a gummy worm from CBS who was to say the difference a difference he says parents should be aware of", "3Mn2xa0bXgg": "[Music] [Music] well hello there guys girls non-binary people it's read here

butter-picked chocolate-covered almonds new from brookside it's the simply thins chocolate-coated almonds this is the milk chocolate version and we also have a dark chocolate version nothing more addictive than chocolate covered almonds peroxide is trying to make us feel a little less guilty by only adding a thin coat of chocolate so you can enjoy more nut but still have a bit of chocolate too personally i'd probably keep the regular amount of chocolate let's see if a thinner shell changes this up for the better or worse let's check this in that's a bit of a surprise not only is it covered in chocolate it's got cocoa on it too let's check out the milk version actually pretty surprised to see the dusting cocoa i think it's gonna go great with the milk chocolate and a bit of complexity almond milk chocolate and cocoa let's try it almost gives it like a truffle vibe i like the addition of the cocoa it's not too aggressive pairs well with the sweeter milk chocolate not too bitter in that sense the almond tastes great and smoked chocolate guys it's pretty good i'm used to the really thick milk chocolate covered elements but i'm not entirely missing it because the milk chocolate here does taste pretty good definitely down with that dusting and cocoa very truffle-esque ron's giving this one 8 out of 10. and for the dark fan and pretty well the exact same look that nice dusting of cocoa a dark chocolate covered almond i'm a little curious this is going to be too aggressive with the cocoa taste with the darker chocolate usually when they say darker chocolate it's still pretty sweet and not what i consider dark chocolate i love the combination in the last so let's check this one in dark chocolate oh i really like the richness of that chocolate not necessarily less sweet it's just very rich this even has more of a truffle vod not too aggressive with that cocoa and the tasty almond really shines in this one i think i prefer the dark i find the more intense flavor makes up for the actual lack of chocolate it has a strong truffle vibe but at the same time it kind of makes more room for the almond taste to come through ron's given the dark chocolate nine out of ten i'm really down with this one i found these at sobies across canada you should be able to find that sophie's as well another quick round reviews and see you guys next time you", "egNB5MXTmmc": "[Music]

xi\u00e8 elixir there are half and half lemonade NT th C infuse 100 milligrams so I reviewed a lot of drinks here on wheats and I find them to be pretty good there's some really great ones out there cannabis quenchers awesome Jasper's amazing there of course some Dead's out there but on the whole I do like the drinks so I'm really looking forward to this Dixie elixir half and a half a pretty cool little bottle here it's got a wrapper on the outside I kind of like the idea is that the cap there at the top if you want a dose the cap is designed to help you dose appropriately helps you decide like you know oh what's 10 milliliters blah blah blah blah blah what's it what's a dose of course we're going to ignore that and just drink the whole bottle in terms of half and half I love me some Arnold Palmer's which is what a half lemonade half iced tea is love love love them so I'm hoping like this the drinks in terms of taste are all over the map sometimes they're really bad like as Aspen but that means they can produce excellent rewards like zest and sometimes they're not too bad but they often have this really bitter aftertaste and I find that to be pretty often the case with the drinks I'm having trouble getting it off which is you know par for the course for me we're almost there keep peeling this plastic layer off until we eventually get to the goods oh boy there she goes okay there she is all defrocked there's a little cap that you can pour it in so on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition information I sadly don't see any lab and testing results but that's okay we're gonna hope that it has 100 milligrams in here it says shake gently before consuming which is what we shall do I assume this opens like a childproof lid it does handsome looking bottle there down the hatch hmm it's okay definite cannabis taste to it more tea than lemonade taste it's not too bad um it's only eight and a half ounces so I'll be done with it in no time again there is a slight cannabis taste to it it's not as bitter as the cannabis quench reserves ASP but but it is there so if you really hate that cannabis taste you might want to pass on this one but for me I'm uh I'm I'm I'm David it's again it's not as bitter as some of the the other brands out there hopefully it means it's still gonna be nice and strong so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I'm gonna come back to you in two hours like all of our reviews to let you know how this Dixie elixir has landed thanks for watching weeds guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] Dixie elixir half and half and it's pretty good it is in the oh it got me to about a six I'm about a six right now 400 milligram edible that's not bad and one that only costs eleven bucks which I think I neglected to mention the first half I'm pretty pleased with it the taste was good for a drink it wasn't outstanding tasting and it didn't get me crazy high but overall it's a pretty good little product one that I'm pleased with if you pick if you see it at a dispensary near you and you're looking for a drink and they don't and you don't want to get completely [ __ ] up the Dixie elixir might be the product for you I think I might try another one in the future see how it goes for me but overall this is a it's gonna give them my own thumbs up for me not a not a ringing endorsement but but far from uh from a negative review so uh that's gonna do it for this review here guys a nice short and sweet one but before I go and share with you a little cherry on top something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily we'd really did something I just love that I want to express to you guys and hopefully you will dig as well and this week uh it is going to be Silicon Valley yay there's a little Dinesh in a little guilfoyle now normally I'm very much against these little pop vinyls I think that's what they're called these things just seem like capitalism gone amok but well here becomes capitalism run amuck I think I got in flight two for $5.00 at Gamestop and I was like well III have to have a Dinesh and Gilfoyle so Silicon Valley uh-huh on HBO great great show by the legendary Mike judge of beavis and butthead and king of the hill and office space the movie so it's a great show about that Lampoon's Silicon Valley and I just culture hysterical in its fifth season right now on HBO check it out if you haven't I'm sure you've heard about it from people other than just me and that guys is gonna do it from the cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat thank you so much for sticking around to the very end guys and we will see you on the next review peace", "wKX0mVfsrKo": "hello my old school soulful family chef jeffrey back with another video hey y'all today i'm gonna do a quick video i had nothing to do with birthday month had nothing to do with my favorites but something i wouldn't been wanting to try i want to try a mixed berry cobbler here i've seen these before i've never made them before so here i'm going to give it a try here uh the berries here i got is strawberries blueberries blackberries and raspberries so i see i want to give it a try and see how this will come out so we're going to give it a shot here because i love blackberry cobbler i love blueberry cobbler i love raspberries so we're going to see how it is so i already added my and my sugar to this i've added my my pineapple juice that's the secret of my cobblers if y'all been following me long enough y'all probably have seen me make so many couples so i'm just putting this in here let go and i'll let you know what's in it put my butt in here vanilla and this is my cobbler pot y'all a little vanilla here y'all been following me long enough when i make this when i bring this pot out it means it's cobbler nutmeg little cinnamon and i'm gonna put the description of the video here i'm gonna put the recipe in the description of the video y'all and i'm making this just like i do every other couple the same ingredients and everything the only thing i'm changing is the type of fruit it's going to be the same amount as i do with every other every other cobbler so we're going to let this come to a boil like every cobbler once it come to a boil i'm going to tighten it up with some uh cornstarch and then we'll pour it in the pan put the crust on there and we'll have with some cobbler and i do like everything i'll do others i got half the berries in here and i'm gonna leave half and put in there right in directly into the bacon dish that way these berries get mushy i still have some berries that's uh holy shape that's not in actual in the uh in the actual cobbler so we'll be right back once this gets the boiling i'm gonna get my i'm gonna get my dough and gone put the bottom crust into my y'all know i use uh y'all know i don't make potato i don't have time i'm not gonna waste time making pie dough y'all follow me long enough y'all know i use the peel berry rollout crust so easy so simple uh it's a it's a game changer so anyway i'm gonna put the bottom crust in there and i'm gonna come back like in a few minutes and tighten this up with a cornstarch and we'll go from there we'll be right back okay y'all we back here okay y'all i i like for my uh cobbler to come to a complete bar before i add the cornstarch so it doesn't take us too much longer for it to to take effect before they thicken up but you know cornstarch to really get the full activation out of it your liquid needs to be boiling so we're gonna put the cornstarch in here thicken it up see see how quick it got thick if there hadn't been boiling it would have took longer for a little bit more because i'm gonna make it a little extra thicker because i got the frozen berries over here remember that i took some frozen berries and put in here so that that liquid from the frozen berry is going to thin this out a little as is in the oven so let this cook just a second here see how pretty that feeling is and that's why i took some of the frozen berries out y'all and put in there and not in here because see how it broke it up but it did give it a nice pretty color you got the blueberries in here blackberries raspberries and strawberries okay now what i'm gonna do now how quick that was i'm gonna ladle this in here i would pour it but i think i'll make a mess today so i'm gonna take this let me make sure y'all can see what i'm doing here just a little here okay take this and ladle the juice in here y'all make sure you get most of the berries there see that's why i made it so thick because i know when this started cooking and mixing with the other berries it's going to thin out a lot a little bit more and that's it now over here out of the way now all i'm gonna do now i'm gonna put the top crust on here and we'll be ready to put it in the oven the crop crust is very easy very simple move it over here y'all can see and all i did let me hear you you know the recipe is description of the video i took frozen berries pineapple juice butter like every cobbler cinnamon nutmeg vanilla i make the same way every cobbler y'all no difference no matter what fruit i'm using so now all i'm gonna do is just nothing fancy here just put the topping on there like i told people you don't have to be fancy with this just get it on there get it on there any way you can some people try to be fancy with the lattice cut that ain't me that's not me y'all go there we go and you could put it also just cover it up completely with the dough you don't have to make the little strings like i do i just do this kind of give it like my buddy uh jack chaplin you know of uh daddy jax y'all watch his cooking channel like he say i appeal is half the meal i remember that same time he watched his video he said that sometime i appeal is half the meal meaning presentation very important okay now i'm gonna put some butter on here a little butter i had left over i use a little butter y'all see i got some cornbread sitting there i made some homemade butter beans from my neighbor i've already did rest i already did a video on that i didn't show a video but they want some homemade butter beans and and ham hocks today so i made them that with some cornbread about neighbor got seven people seven a family of seven big ol pot of butter beans and ham hawks can't go wrong for that okay now i got the butter on there now i'm gonna sprinkle it with a little sugar a little sugar on there and then that nice crystallization when it come out and that's it i'm gonna put it over 350 degrees by 30 to 35 minutes and this cobbler will be complete and we'll check it out we'll be right back all right y'all we are back here the cobbler is fresh out of the oven and y'all i'm gonna let this thing sit for like three hours i'm never definitely gonna let it set up and cool off so when i do scoop it it's not uh running all over the place a lot of times i do that and people say oh it's too loose too no it's once it cool off believe me it thickens up so i'm gonna come back in about three hours and we're gonna uh taste a little this the rest of this going to my neighbor like i say tonight i'm cooking them some butter beans and ham hawks and cornbread and this dessert is uh old school mixed berry cobbler i'm gonna take a bowl out of this and give them the rest and let them enjoy so anyway uh we'll be back in about about uh three hours we'll check this out and we'll see how good it is we'll be right back okay y'all we back it's been about a couple hours i let this thing kind of set up and cool off now we're going to cut into this thing it makes a big difference when you let it set up see that man look at all that fruit in there it's also easy to eat easier to eat y'all okay now let's try this out see how this tastes here oh wow the berries they work so well together you got you can taste the blackberries coming through i think that's the dominant fruit in it blackberry and then the raspberry the blueberry custardy the blueberries and the strawberries didn't break down but the raspberry and the blackberry definitely breaks down and definitely the dominant uh flavor coming through but it's awesome my neighbors gonna love this cause i'm gonna get a good melon scoop here and i'm gonna let them have it but yeah try this recipe first time i ever did the fort berry cobbler i did every bird cobbler separately but i never did the four berry cobbler so try this out try this recipe and i'm gonna close this recipe out

remember doing a review actually a couple of reviews on their fruit series back in the day this one here is very good now I don't remember it doesn't sound familiar to me even though I've done like 500 videos on a juice ha's so doesn't sound like it rings a bell or doesn't ring a bell so I will say that I haven't reviewed it so we're gonna go ahead and do it today if you guys can go ahead and check that [ __ ] out right there pick this [ __ ] up I don't why keep calling everything in everybody [ __ ] I gotta stop at the [ __ ] this one up a tea juice that deals you guys already know where I get my eliquid from use the code flavor 15 get yourself 15% off your tidy juice deals courtesy of went over to e juice deals this one is $14.99 for a hundred ml comes in zero three and six milligrams up yeah okay hey it doesn't say anything for the full favorite description as you guys know kilo is never on that childlike appealing bandwagon that is classy as [ __ ] that's the way old labels should be nicotine warning Cali prop 65 they're good to go on that packaging I like the way they do their packaging and kilo I will commend them for doing such a good job on their boxes and their labels that's just the way it should be okay so this one here are the [ __ ] you fairies are coming out in swaths of [ __ ] why where are you going with that anyway I'm getting these are old bottles but yet their labels are new nicotine warning Cali prop 65 everything is good to go and you guys can see when they're flat getting a visit from their fat fan give this [ __ ] a good shake turn this one up right here put cap down and let's have a little Stacy seeing you in like three videos guess what I don't really like you and I keep mugga I don't like your father I don't like any part of your family gets wood but [Music] all right so I'm guessing this is a pari juice since it's very good ooh that smells nice see if we do mmm fresh air now back in the day when I first started vaping I remember I was looking for a really good pair a juice cuz I love to eat pears plain and simple and I couldn't find one that actually matched my tastes taste like a pear like a fresh pear you guys already know what what's gonna happen yeah you guys already know what's going on so I'm gonna go ahead and saturate damn a whole week to not see you [ __ ] in a minute Oh bought a choice small ant beater box with the pulse v2 by Tony B I totally forgot I'm an idiot I'm sorry smells like a pair like a fresh pair nothing else to say there oh I'm a poet and I didn't even know it do tears in a bucket [ __ ] it let's take it to stage [ __ ] smells like a fresh pair hopefully this doesn't have that aftertaste that most pear juice is do so tap catbag only out air holes adjusted I'm not even gonna bother this thing is giving me issue all right yeah you get that intense pear flavor with this even like when I just did that this one's Perry goodbye fruit series kilo 100 watts let's give this [ __ ] a Bri definitely get a pair and a fresh one at that and I don't know how to describe that it you could it tastes exactly like a pair like after you bite into the pair you get like that after tone pay air taste that's exactly what I'm tasting here I don't know if that made sense I'm just winging it here with the taste descriptions so give it another read tastes like a pari juice nothing else no harsh taste nicotine is good not making me wheezes this is three three milligram another hit I'll let you guys go that's a weird taste now I'm thinking about it at the end he's like a real good fresh air in the beginning but on the end I don't know maybe a little little harshness other than that I think it's pretty good so if you guys are into pear ejuice is I'll say pick it up [ __ ] one might I say no anyway thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video you know what to do slap a thumbs up on it you have not subscribed to this channel go ahead and do somebody so

own restaurant pastry chef she's sort of well you know people know who she is she's written a cookbook and Wow she's like doing cannabis when we set out to create a brand for edibles we wanted it to be sort of sheffy under the Cresco brand we're looking at Mindy's artisanal a little bit more high-end that's where our chocolates and baked goods come in they're made with a distillate oil when we sat down and we talked about like I want to do my Brittles I've been making these brittles for years I want to see what it's like to make my brittles have THC in it what starts with good quality chocolate really she likes to blend so our flavors are a little bit of mix mixes of this chocolate that chocolates our specificity and then we add on the crunchies and the gooeys as we like to call them so she loves rich dead decadent caramel or peanut butter and then we'll make a toffee or brittle that will chop up and kind of mix into the bar I kind of feel like we have a really wide variety of edibles and I kind of feel like there is something for everybody and they're really really accurately goes on our more confectionery base and our sugar products I guess is Mindy's kitchen so that's where our gummies fall under we have Fruit Chews under that line as well as hard sweets so you know you're sucking candy is sugar base just kind of quick little bites I'm ahead of the game you know and I know there's gonna be a lot of other people are gonna get into industry hopefully my brand will be established and I mean it's gonna be like it's the craziest thing it's gonna be like you know like the Wild West I'm very excited about the future of this industry I'm glad that I'm in it and I'm glad that I'm a part of it that I've like sort of almost laid a foundation for other people like me [Music]", "l5CnT3CzYMM": "hi there bugs in my last video i showed you guys how to make can of butter in the magic potter 2.0 machine if you don't know how to make magical butter click up here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "_Fe5kw49NTo": "now i'm just going to wing this okay i'm just

help people", "T1tj62nRWf4": "waters up everybody and welcome back to another product review for today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining

hey are we salad clouds around", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "sl-pKOg1gso": "today Kevin and I are going to be reviewing the sugar-free Hawaiian Punch singles together these were $2.99 at Walgreens that you get 46 inside but there are four flavors of fruit juicy red wild purple smash buried bunkers and berry blue - so I'm gonna let you get them already while i read what's on the box okay now when you open them up they're not color coded they're all blue so I'm assuming that's downward reformer okay where do you see that oh yeah okay that one's okay so that would be an immediate compliant is easily identification right because for example we reviewed a 40 pack of the skittles the skittles are very clearly there is a purple one there is a yellow one there's a purple one there's an orange when there's a red one and there's a grey one the berry - it could be almost dark in the room and I can get in the box and look oh it's purple and pull it out so this you're actually having to take this out and read it which I just I think they could have made that easier they could have color-coded it like they did on the box so what did you go got buried bunkers here's wild purple smash blueberries - and a dip say these terribly you need a fruit juicy red there's a pretty juicy Brad okay it says now you can take the refreshing taste of sugar bring the wine touch anywhere you go with 40 packets in each box you can enjoy a quick and delicious drink at the gym during market pull in your car or wherever you go [Applause] yeah that is a pain because anytime I'm very trim comes in the box I don't I don't want to start like this just like with the skittles I liked all this fit they were all good but my favorite was the purple so I went through and I picked out all the purple ones so this one as unique as I was you know this one I would literally have to take them all out of the box if I didn't like certain ones and divide them up yeah what makes it easier on them to print them but still it would have been nice but it's easy for the customer so they just need to know that these are the fruit juicy red and wild purple smash are five calories these berry bunkers and berry blue typhoon are 10 calories so and these are the I would think these little skittles are primates out the same company they're made by its mods it's the gel cert company in Chicago Illinois it's probably the same company it's easy to make take a sip from a full bottle of water to make room for powder pour one packet into a 16.9 points bought fluid ounce bottle which we did shake the bottle bottle until the pilot resolves listen they both kills the gel circa that's it same company so yeah so the skittles is decided here but is this and I like all of these girls but I prefer like the purple one knowing it all everyone's first I've been drinking all the green ones first right so it's just it's just easier to identify them if there's a color-coded like that so or you want to trauma in this order no I just tell I don't care let's do the wild purple smash this one yes exactly that firm on the purple or the same one is a little bit wider person that's very cool mm-hmm um I mean it's uh bad it's not bad but it's also not overly sweet no I have been drinking a lot of skittles yeah so we're expert school yeah this is not near as Swift as the skittles well it's got oh my god it's a horse like in my column just bitter or anything like that it's just that I don't know yeah yeah smooth sweet yeah it's just not as good it's oh yeah it's okay but it would not be one that like that one out I wouldn't necessarily want to pick that one yeah that was pretty much great I think it was great yeah it was mainly grape it just wasn't an overly sweet right right so now this is the berry bunkers who knows once again it's not a sweet it's that same flavor the same level of sweetness as the one before it does have a very vibrant that's a very flavor the flavor is okay it's just as it has that underlying well because there are harshness like a roughness to it yeah no III understand what you're saying it's hard to explain this is very blue type thing well Scratchy when you're drinking it I mean that seems crazy but it is that would have liked more than any at home um it did have that it's sweeter I think that's why it this is so far has been the sweetest one there and it does taste like it does have a berry flavor to it so that one I would I would pick out of the box I mean I probably won't throw it wouldn't you not throw it but I really wouldn't give away any of these there's just something that I would choose before others so then this one is the fruit juicy bread and that Brian like that one the best that one in the berry blue typhoon are probably my very favorite in there is that fruit juice it does yes it tastes for me it's more like a tropical kind of I got a punch like why imagine I think is the best yeah like and it's also on the sweeter side so I do like both of these and I know just because they're sugar-free doesn't mean they weren't didn't have the ability to put the sweetness in there because the skittles or sugar-free as well and they're like over-the-top sweet so those first two they just weren't as sweet as the other ones this one you said tropical punch is this wine punch for ants I'd say this yeah why this is quite like the original red wine yeah um this though this box because I only like half of the flavors really a watch I would not buy this box again no worries like the skittles I was by the skittles over and over again I could drink any of them yes there are something I like more than others but I like them all these I just I wouldn't care if I ever had those first two in this frame would don't be a mix that I was right and the skittles me and Amy complimented each other because once she really liked it I was okay with the ones I would like she was okay with so we could split the box yeah with these neither one of us would really pick the Purple's out for us right exactly what's rubbing Riddler yeah exactly that's it that's probably the back side that's a personal preference I wouldn't buy this video I'm not sure I have the skills because they're just so good right yeah that quick drink of liquid Cavey yeah it really is yeah if you see only you need to get on we're still only seeing them at Walgreens so that's just where you have to look for these things for now hopefully they'll get them in Walmart soon and they'll be a little bit cheaper so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "bipyjjv3Uz0": "200 ml condensed milk warm it in low heat for 3

have one we have this is real sugar-free peach and blueberry pie so this is actually a nectarine so i'll update the name nectarine i have one for four days so i'm going to chop these up a little more finely before i put it in the saucepan and i'll just use a whole pint of blueberries so my dates will be my sweetener natural sugar and these are the dates and um my peaches this peach was really ripe

and push down into each segment okay make okay okay guys now we're ready for our pie filling you want to just continue to stir throughout you'll see the blueberries start to turn colors that's good it's like you're making a jam almost the dates are really soft i don't know if you can see this but these are the dates they're really small soft that's what we want and we're just going to keep

Phil via a general practitioner and writer and this is Africa where health where we provide you with direction and clarity about everything medical the measures to manage cycle cell anemia the inherited condition that affects hemoglobin in the blood which can cause significant illness have evolved over several years in this video we're looking at the current that is the most recent updates for potential cures we have available in 2020 now for several years a cure for sickle cell anemia has been largely elusive in places like Nigeria and West Africa the country that has the highest burden for sickle cell anemia people hardly talk about a cure for the disease and people who suffer with sickle cell anemia resigned themselves with prevention as much as they can sickle cell crisis and taking treatments that can promote their health as much as possible however for some years now there has been a cure but it has been mostly available in high-income countries where there are adequate facilities and effective health came from structure to manage the process of delivering the cure and maintaining people's health afterwards what kyoto called stem cell transplant has developed challenges in terms of its use and administration and so a lot more recently within the last six months a new alternative has developed known as gene therapy we're going to talk about both of them but start with stem cell therapy stem cell therapy in sickle cell anemia requires that the individual with sickle cell anemia who is going to undergo treatment has a healthy brother or sister from whom stem cells can be taken or harvested in order for the procedure to be carried out now stem cells are particular types of human cells that can develop into many other types of human cells for example muscle cells or brain cells or bone cells how do we get them cells there are two main sources first human embryos some human stem cells are produced from the embryos that is immature fetuses during in-vitro fertilization and donated to science other stem cells can be formed from fully developed adult cells the critical thing about stem cell is their ability to develop into other types of cells inside the body so essentially in stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia it is thought that the healthy cells taken from the donors bone marrow will be transplanted into the recipient and developed into non sickle cells red cells within the recipient the person who's suffering from sickle cell anemia the like I mentioned earlier there are some challenges with stem cell therapy one of the problems is that many people with sickle cell anemia do not have a healthy relative or healthy sibling brother sister who can act as a donor for normal or healthy stem cells to be harvested from the other problem that could happen is that they may develop serious complications following the transplant assuming they're able to get his sibling donor there may be serious complications after the chance but all the transplants may fail and the finished stem cells stem cell science is still evolving is still developing they still in lots for scientists to learn about techniques which with which the stem cells can be controlled and used appropriately the way you want to for the benefits of of science of medicine and there's also also the issue that some people find it troubling use stem cells obtained from embryos that are not used after cycles of IVF but an alternative solution has come up and this is gene therapy in gene therapy for sickle cell anemia it is the patient the person who suffers from sickle cell anemia it's their own stem cell that I used so removing the need for a compatible donor now to understand how this works we need to digress a little bit and talk about the role of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease now fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin efforts we also call it is unique for quite a few reasons number one it appears to be very well-suited for supporting or maintaining the baby within the wounds low oxygen environment compared to normal or healthy adult hemoglobin researchers have also found that the presence of fetal hemoglobin prevents the formation of the cold red blood cells now after birth and as they developed infants or young babies gradually stop producing this fetal hemoglobin and instead start to develop what is MV an adult hemoglobin the hemoglobin that they will eventually continue with us and all the children and as adults for the rest of their lives now this process where they stop producing hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin starts or tends to happen from about four to six months age so what you find is that from about forty six months of age in children with normal immigrating genotype the hemoglobin F will be replaced by hemoglobin a but in a child with the SS genotype the hemoglobin F is going to be replaced by hemoglobin s that causes the cleaner of the red blood cells now the crux of gene therapy and this is research that's still ongoing with clinical trials that are presently going on at the Boston Children's Hospital in the United States this research has shown that the production of fetal hemoglobin can be reactivated which in the case of an individual with sickle-cell disease will be first the condition now the scientists working on this belief that this process can be reversed by the activity or or suppressing or preventing the activity of the of a protein called be the L 11a and so what they do is they use an inactive virus to deliver instructions genetic instructions to the RNA of the red blood cell of the person the individual with sickle-cell disease and these instructions are meant to drastically reduce the production of this protein bcl11a in the individuals red blood cells and this is what allows the reversal from the adult hemoglobin in that individual to the feats of hemoglobin okay so it's a lot more complicated than what I've just said and clinical trials are going on the process is underway there are if they're described as promising they're individuals who have received these treatments and they're promising resource and if you want to read more about sage and find out more details I will put a link to the Pape and E and research studies in the description box below so please are the measures available for people who ask what is they care is their care for sickle cell anemia these are the measures available to consider in terms of cost accessibility availability they are technical highly specialized procedures that have still been looked into in high-income countries and the United States so the feasibility of having them performed in lower middle-income countries of course can be quite challenging but they are fair as an option and possibly in the next decade or less maybe more available to other parts of the world so let's watch this faith now if you are interested in a 7-point checklist for what people with the a s genetic short considered when the ancient relationship is all generally should be aware of about their health care status make sure you check the link in the description below because I got a free II leaflets on that particular topic now next time in this series are going to be looking at the treatment available for sickle cell anemia understanding the treatment of sickle cell anemia so what drugs to people the sickle cell anemia need and when they are having a crisis or just to maintain their health generally and why do they need this medication so make sure you check out that video could put the link
