{"N2rKR9IMdFQ": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another alpine live resin cart they gave me three strains so there will be three videos you know what i'm saying so in this video we're gonna be smoking on the gmo and you guys already know what that is someone said is garlic mushroom onions or whatever i don't know what it stands for the acronym but we just know that gmo is usually good most of the time you know so we have the alpine limited edition gmo cannabis live resin or cannabis oil or live resin cannabis as well okay [ __ ] it up you could pause it from going too fast also check the sides so this is the second alpine live resin card that i've tried and the first one was phenomenal towards the end it kind of did get clogged but you know with every cartridge that has ever been made it clogs mostly towards the end so you can't really fault him for that but very enjoyable experience from the skittles punch so i'm excited to try this and i did feel like maybe i didn't give this uh its fair share of the battery because 2.6 didn't really do much we're gonna just start it at three and see just you know do the battery so with the alpine you got your manual got the cartridge itself i like this color i love it so let's just smell this doesn't really smell like anything but here is the cartridge itself i'm going too fast i'm sorry you could pause but very nice so we're going to be using it on obviously the alpine battery at first but we're also going to be using on a third-party battery the shiv so but cheers guys see the battery didn't really hit that well so generally with live resins especially new cartridges start on the lowest um but you know from my previous video i did do 2.6 nothing really came out so i'm gonna try it again i'm gonna do a half a one and a half so i like how this tastes drastically different than the skittles punch it does not taste the same at all but it has its own unique taste it's very enjoyable i would say maybe my favorite out of the two is the skittles punch because it did have a sweetness towards it or towards the end and i really enjoyed but this is not bad i'm taking another hit see the hits aren't all that there with these batteries but luckily i do have this we can just uh maybe it's just i don't know i don't know what it is but i'm actually gonna up the ante we're gonna put 2.8 [ __ ] it right so cheers guys oh so you're not gonna get the fattest hits from these alpine cartridges and i i feel like it's because we're starting it at a low voltage we're not really putting it on the highest voltage to get that vapor because you'll burn off the terps that way but just smoke a little bit more than usual you know i'm saying take a little few more extra hits than usual and it should get you just as high i really enjoy it the experience is pretty pretty phenomenal especially for these cartridges that aren't even out yet this is their first run of cartridges in the live resin market good good stuff so take another hit cheers let's let's let's go into eight [ __ ] it all right eight let's go to three so cheers so far i'm enjoying the alpine live resin cartridges very enjoyable i wouldn't be able to compare to the first one because i've never tried their first cartridges that they've had but if i had to compare this live resin to other live resin cartridges on the market it's definitely up there among the top five so yeah i'm gonna take one more here for you guys and pull it towards the light to show you guys that you know maybe it's just the light that doesn't show the cloudage but cheers peace out guys [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned something please tap to have that like button if you really enjoyed it hit subscribe in that little Bell to stay up to date on all of our latest if you think I've missed anything if you have a differing opinion than me please throw it down in the comments below until next time my name is Alex for TV TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep baby", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters

excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get

"U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "mEmbfpPDltg": "oh it's not a plot to make me change like a castaway you know you page that you bought the color today k you know your boy did it your boy [ __ ] did it boy so we just got out of the damn dispensary right now and they didn't have actually anything that I was looking for I was I came to get the cannabis dr terpenes pots firm steady because i like those are some of my favorite ones and i thought i would treat myself to one but then i have anything so I went for the live resin I went for the GMO cookies half gram and it's everything verified man you know well you know I could get this all for free if I hit up city but honestly I would rather support them and support your businesses especially during these times in the crisis man especially they've done a lot of supporting to me and I'm support them back so we ended up coming to strange right here let me go ahead and turn down the freakin I so this is in Paris if you guys didn't know so yeah man if you guys are ever in the area this is the one that I usually come to they have the most reliable stuff there I'm licensed everything there they have fresh stuff all the time so that's pretty cool man so yeah man I'm gonna go ahead and head back to my house and go ahead and try this out for us and Brandon you haven't even opened it none of that stuff so a few guys can get a little I love that I love getting that little satisfaction when opening a brand-new package man so let's see if you guys feel the same way Oh baby so first things first you guys saw before I even did man I can't not see it at all let me know how it looks in the comments below is it does it look like it's gonna smack oh yeah oh yeah it looks like it's gonna smack guys so right here like I said we got GMO cookies take that sucker out take this one out and if your stitch does n't have this California weed sticker on it man you're probably smoking a fake guys so go ahead and pop it on my silver battery I was actually just charging this before I brought it along with me so you know it's gonna give some nice fat milky hits guys let me know in the comments below which live resin you've tried from City let me know if you guys have ever tried the cannabis drive terpenes pods because that personally is my favorite man I think the last time that I tried one was sour gorilla or something like that or gorillas gasp gorilla gasp I think it was a sour girl then one of those two men but either way it's the living hell out of me and this is my first time hitting a live residents dizzy since the moment they came out so I'm kind of excited for this man go ahead and leave a like if you're as excited as I am in and if you're over the age of 18 and 21 man let me know in the comments what you're smoking cheers guys [Music] oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah boys off of that first hit dude that tastes so freakin good hold on GMO cookies that taste so freakin bomb I'm talking about that initial hit just smacked me it just straight-up like came up to me grabbed me by my collar and just smacked me oh man and what is this an indica yes this is an indica man I feel the indica right away I feel it rushing through my head trying to go down to my body to just automatically put me in a couch lock boys oh man I'm gonna have to go ahead and hit this one more time for you guys right away Cheers mmm oh yeah man they're so freakin good dude yeah that is so freakin good like I'm be honest I keep about opening the windows because it's such a nice day outside so I'm trying to get some fresh air if you know what I mean but like this live resin pod guys it has this right here is live resin this right here is true live resin you know this is what I'm talking about when I think of like resin this is what I'm thinking about that taste that I'm getting and just search an earthy sweet freakin just just a conjunction of flavors man that just fills your taste buds your lungs and it just smacks you man getting you high as heck cuz that's what it does for me man I'm just sitting here just in love right now I'm I'm happy that I got this man I'm really really happy that I got this because this was this was $50 this was $50 for a half gram guys so for me to actually go out there and spend $50 on something that is even a full gram um you know that means a lot that means a lot dizzi you guys are killing it man with these libraries and poets please though please hook your boy up with some CDP some County by cannabis Drive terpene pods because you guys know man that's my favorite one so I'm so I'm not not superstar but I am just at a relaxed stone right now you know so let's go ahead and keep taking it taking you guys on the it's man i'ma try I'm trying to tell you guys what I get out of this because honestly I I'm not getting any GMO cookies it's more of like just a full spectrum light resin taste that just like that most live resins taste like I'm trying to pinpoint get the pinpoint accurate flavor profiles on this alright right yep oh yeah like with GMO it gives off a very very like like gassy but it's not normal gassy it's like kind of like a gassy that garlic gives out and if you guys have ever like if you guys know GMO it has that that reputation of giving off like a garlicky smell and you know when you're chopping up garlic that initial aroma that comes out that spews out of the garlic itself that's what it kind of like tastes like and some of you probably what the hell that cannot taste good but the thing is it's just so distinct right it's not exactly garlic but just like the gas enos of it you guys would have to try it out yourselves man honestly this light resin pod is just doing its job and it's doing the work I am super happy I'm not complaining at all about this like Stiggy you guys are doing your theme and I love you guys so much thank you guys I think that's why stacy is one of the is one of the best if not the best brand out right now because the things that they're doing men is just insane man I just the one thing that I just want to do is just go out by like 1500 of the live resin in cannabis drive turn bean pods and just you never go out and buy another pod again man that's it like if I had to choose a pod system for the rest of my life I would probably choose librarian's disease or CDP's disease for sure one thing though I want to try before before anything is the which which one was it that caught my attention the ice cream cake I think that's what it's called the ice cream cake flavor caught my attention but they didn't have it in stock right that they had all my weed maps patient but they didn't have it in stock so I was kind of bummed out you know I cuz first I went in there to get this the cannabis Drive terpenes ones they didn't have them I wanted the ice cream cake they didn't have it so I had to settle for this one and I'm not even and all because GMO cookies is phenomenal every single time that I've ever tried a GMO cookies whether it's from you know connected California or jungle boys whether they have such amazing strains that they just every single time I try one it just blows me away how many different varieties of GMO cookies are really are so man and this one right here in a live residents dizzy pod is definitely a whole different experience like you get that lat GMO in a sense but it's not it's not all the way there you get that more of that live resin taste man I could probably sit here and just smoke this all day it's it's not harsh at all on the throat it's just it gives you super fat clouds and it feels like you're taking a fat dab you know it feels like you're taking a fat dab and no other pod really gives you like that I like the only one that really tastes like a dab dab it's kind of I would probably have to say the most similar one that I remember would probably friendly farms that one is the most pinpoint accurate one they taste kind of around the same guy and they're both full spectrum light resins so yeah man that's definitely the taste that you want to be getting when when you know consuming a live resin pod guys just remember that and you want it to be like a little ambarish color like this you do not want it to be like clear you don't want to look like like super super dark either you kind of have to know how it's gonna look like man and I think steezy they got this one really really good man because the color on this it's almost see-through but it has that ambarish dark color that you want to that you want to see in the light resin so yeah man I am I like I keep saying this man but I'm just happy that I went out of my way to go get this food so I'm gonna go ahead and out at the video here if you guys enjoyed today's um you know ride along with me to go get this dizzy make sure to leave a like and make sure to leave a comment and most importantly make sure to hit that subscribe button guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day I will catch you guys in the next one jzuk Greg function on the ground bloody knuckles I've been super buddy I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now because I'm post on", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional

like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "DGgLALjkyLs": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respect my region.com here today with a quick west coast week 2 review featuring alpine vapor and their gmo times bp9 hybrid live resin cannabis oil it's a vape cartridge it's a one gram 1000 milligram vape cartridge and my oh my i'm excited to try this i vape live resin every day i dab live resin about every other day and this is a limited edition run um from from alpine one of california's premier cannabis uh extraction companies and so i'm going to read a little bit about the packaging and kind of share some information i've got a battery here um we're going to dive right in so it says here our limited edition cartridges are craft candidates at its finest they're made using only pure live resin from sun grown cannabis these small batch releases are true to the natural aroma of the plant and are an exploration and taste outside the norm instructions you our cartridges are designed for use with 510 batteries inhale for two to four seconds for maximum flavor use at the lowest voltage setting on your alpine bakery now unfortunately on a previous review video i did use the battery at the lowest setting and it wasn't powerful enough to really really give the car what i would consider as the best representation of itself so i'm going to honestly move it up one twist on the voltage here for the battery so that way i can get slightly slightly warmer than the lowest temperature to make this really rip in terms of the gmo times the bp9 i do have a little bit of information it says gmo times banana punch number nine a true hybrid cut with cannabis cup lineage of purple punch banana og and gmo so this is going to be punchy og and gmo it says this cultivator yeah this cultivator is a great blend of sweet and sour with undertones of gas tropical fruit and curried spice that's a big claim so we're gonna see if i get that earthy spicy punchiness here we go how do i wanna i don't really wanna i don't really want to open it up from the top and ruin that beautiful stickers oh came right out there we go check it out all right so we've got we've got some terps in the jar here and the two i like it when it comes to the cartridge we've got a white ceramic and glass cart i love it we've got some nice chunky holes on the bottom right here that's where that pull is going to come through and be kind of sucking in the oil for lack of a better way to put it 510 thread brand new battery here literally brand new not even using the one that i used the other day this one is quite literally unopened all right beautiful packaging nice chunky battery here all right so one two three four five hits to turn it on branded it's on the lowest setting now i'll rip it just to show them that i just don't believe this battery is the right one at the lowest setting for this cartridge so i'm gonna do it it's not on too tight but it is sealed here we go chris you ready moment of truth absolutely nothing yet one two three four five try it again all right that's a five second rip right there kind of light in terms of the vapor and the flavor although it was there i didn't actually get enough of an inhale to really taste that much terps and so i'm going to go a seven second rip again on the lowest temperature try to give it another chance at 2.6 volts here we go all right so on that one a little bit more turks a little bit bigger cloud and what i'm really tasting is this light floral spice i'm getting a little bit of pine and a little bit of berry flavor the fact that i can get some actual good flavor on this lowest setting without a major cloud i think it's impressive um i am going to twist this over to let's call it one line two lines we're gonna go up to three volts here and we're going to see what that does maybe it maybe it burns it maybe it doesn't here we go it's definitely a different flavor and taste experience in terms of how it ends up in your mouth i feel like at a slightly higher temperature it gets a little bit more on the earthy spicy side comparatively to the light and floral so we've done three hits here i talked about that on the first hit you i gave it a second chance with the seven second uh blinker right there and then on this last one we turn it up to three volts three hits let's see what i'm thinking here for a score out of ten presentation appeal color taste potency i think this is really coming through and hitting nice um what i what i'd really like to see is some of the genetics information that's on you know the piece of paper need to make it on this i want to see the terpene profile i want to see some of that strain lineage and information it helps the consumer know what kind of high we're about to experience um in this box the presentation is very attractive i like i like the sticker i like the label i like the black and the shiny metallic i'm really attracted to this the color of the oil looks great um is this the best battery for this cartridge i don't believe so um the big my least favorite thing is the battery it doesn't match i don't think it powers this vape cartridge the right way um i've had better experiences with c cells classic just draw and pull on it um and so all things considered um would i recommend it yes more information there's solid information on here i'd like to know more about the genetics and the lineage and the terps um but with all that said i'm sitting here thinking this is an 8.75 it's a very solid high score i definitely believe that this is 100 sun grown flower cannabis you know pure live resin there's no distillate there's no popcorny experience to this no taste no that kind of flavor um but yeah the battery in my opinion is just really holding this experience back and so um we'll use this we'll use this battery again for the next review and i'm going to bring another battery on again to see if i get a better or different experience but for now let me know what you guys think 8.75 is my score big thank you to alpine vapor for working with this on the respect my region west coast we tour and don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel y'all i'll see you all down the road appreciate you guys peace", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically

body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here

smart the great way to check", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their

cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you found this video helpful and leave us a comment with your feedback take care everyone", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got

anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't

vaporizer out for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos

just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another this is what it looks like when you open it up a bit tight when you first get it because you want these to last for a long time cylinder filler you could use a toothpick if you have one [Music] put that in there and now what i'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight and connected and then put this right on [Music] here [Music] now we have it connected just flip this over and that is how that is set up right now and then just watch it go down so you can either leave it there for a while if you leave it there for a few hours depends on how your oil is sometimes they are a little thicker than others and it might just take time so you could either heat up the oil by putting it next to a heat source or you could just let it sit there and eventually all that oil will go down you", "wGsPh51K65M": "[Music] hey it's mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you

it's just it's different you know and like always everybody we're using the regular select universal battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you

all new cool jars 810 hotshot 1500 are top-of-the-line lightning fast kart filling system capable of filling 12,000 cartridges in an eight-hour day with next to zero waste an absolute minimal clean-out required for the next minute or so we're going to give you a very quick look at this remarkable new system to include its speed precision and flexibility you probably have questions and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a 10 hot shop tart filling systems

you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape

have a wonderful day thanks so much for tuning in we'll see you next time this has been John I'm just a tea connoisseurs piece", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an

oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank

like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a

button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ]

the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you

probably just a barbeque that day tomorrow you know drink some beers and [ __ ] watch the game that's on this Saturday morning he has plans which you guys smoking on but I'm gonna hit this guy before I cut the video short guys and I'm I'm gonna be coming up with the for-sure for-sure this week I'm gonna do like a strain review you know hotbox I have my barn with me as well gonna be doing some bond ribs for you guys you guys stay tuned you know maybe later on today or tomorrow morning I'll be coming up with the new videos so guys I'm a end the video imma gonna hit this again and I'm going sad because it's cold as [ __ ] these things rip like a [ __ ] rock garden as well [ __ ] alright guys but thanks for watching guys you guys stay tuned I'm gonna be coming up with a new beat as I said and yeah", "BjQcbPAd884": "welcome welcome welcome to another stream I'm your host as always Justin this one's gonna be a fun one hi this is this is one of those episodes that has been heavily heavily heavily requested so I think this is one that y'all are going to enjoy a whole lot today we're going to be talking with my good friend Kevin Chen he runs a very fascinating company that is engineering yeast to produce all sorts of interesting things we've talked about yeast engineering many times on the streams and in videos and generally a lot and so it's I think this is gonna be really cool to talk to someone who is doing this sort of professionally and and commercially and also just making a really interesting compound so without further ado let me introduce right your life my life okay oh there we go knocking okay cool ah I'm on TV hi everybody tonight today I introduce myself first or how do you want to yeah just start cool so yeah pleasure to be here and pleasure to a see you all I guess on this nice Saturday afternoon you know it's it's a this I guess just asked me to do this a while ago and that to think about it a bit just because like I got my own obligations with my my company and it's a some professional that I do so there'll be a bunch of stuff that I won't necessarily get into and of course you know opinions are my own when it comes to talking about a lot of the stuff that we'll get into here but yeah we're a company were called hyacinths we've been around for a while now since 2014 working on this particular pathway and doing a lot of yeast engineering we've done some really really interesting stuff with this pathway which we'll talk a little bit about but otherwise you know the whole cannabis industry has been amazing to kind of watch it grow with the past six years and watch the science of it grow and watch the companies kind of develop and being in Canada and watching belts happen it's been super interesting just coz it's like weird yeah that nationwide like legalization or regulation in progress kind of a thing do you remember daddy has been do remember getting the little little card in the mail like saying like it's officially gonna be legal soon oh really I don't know I don't wanna get in that car no oh my god I I don't know if I saved mine but I wanted to frame it yeah and that's like one I mean it's super super interesting to kind of watch all this happen and and we'll talk more about the science stuff but the whole policy around this stuff and and everything is is also huge and it's you know interesting for Canada as a country you know nationwide to kind of create this stuff and kind of force it out in some ways like a lot of people you know we're pretty reluctant about the whole topic and want things to go longer you're not go so fast or whatever else but I guess the the government at the time then he wanted to push it out and for many you know for many reasons it makes a lot of sense to legalize cannabis but anyways yeah so so pleasure to be here you know we I thought this was like a nice thing to do just cuz like it's it's an interesting and fun for me a lot of the reason why I do what I do is because like I like to talk and share and promote science and stuff my my day job as the CEO of hyacinth involves a lot of more like business development in finance related stuff unless so like technology stuff so you know if there's any deep technical questions then I probably won't be able to answer those necessarily anyways it's cuz I haven't been in the lab in a while but I do follow all the tech very closely and watch how everything develops but anyways I think I think that was kind of like you know how how I first met you Justin as well we're like we just we just people who like to do science and people who would like to share what we do and in science and and that's why it's like super fun to kind of be here and and spend a Saturday afternoon with all 411 people I can probably be more by the end of all this cool but yes I mean so so in Kevin Kevin's a very cool guy he does very cool stuff and I like so I mean especially because I'm also working on engineering yeast he has been a fantastic resource just to just to like Santa Santa D Chuck stuff and and just be like hey you know am I am I going crazy am I doing this right he's like and so you know that's been that's been really great so I've got a hyacinth page open write a link to it in the description if you want to check it out it's a really cool company they make so let's talk about the the obvious thing the you know the the stream title says THC but as THC the only thing that you guys are working on no definitely not I mean we like THC is one of a hundred different cannabinoids that exist in cannabis over hundred I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there finding more to like every every time we're like we know all the cannabinoids and they were like no wait there's a new functional group on that one yeah yeah and there's yeah it's all the time new stuff so I mean it's almost I think what we work on is a good reflection of it's maybe a reflection of like how much interest there is around different cannabinoids so you know of course we read all the papers about new ones coming out and and those ones might be you know years away from the market but it's still something that we kind of put on our radar as like hey you know we'll have some development in that maybe one way or another depending on you know how we're broke those all come together you know there's a lot of that's like we're having a bit of a yes dream for use here we can get back in good okay so before the the stream went to [ __ ] we were talking about there are you know all sorts of different cannabinoids and also lots of other things that you guys were working on so let's let's say we can pick it up up from there and I'm just gonna try and keep my eye on the the thing and see if it freezes again hopefully we're good alright so you're saying so so are you are you just mostly working on the different cannabinoids and things in that pathway or are you also looking at compounds from other organisms as well no I'd say we're pretty much set on the cannabinoid pathway other things they look at in my spare time just for fun but or business business-wise that cannabinoids are yeah I mean and that's more than enough of like industry and and market to kind of you know develop and and to work on so it's huge okay fair enough so cool I'm gonna just bring up my notes and and see what the next topic is oh okay so let's talk about the the legality of derivative products in Canada so that we know that the the plant is now legal I mean there's literally a store down the street where you could just walk in and buy stuff yeah but talking about the derivative products specifically because I remember you were you were working on this before the derivative products were legal for sale so like you know you you could still work on them from like a research perspective but I remember there was like a time when you know you were still kind of waiting for the government to catch up before the things that you're making would be sellable basically so how is how has that changed and like it do you know how does that you know affect your your business now and yeah yeah indeed block these comments I'm reading too many of them they're funny anyways so so yeah with the where we sit with respect to regulations yeah it's been dishing to kind of watch things evolve over the years the derivative products that you're talking about is is it pretty so I guess in the history of Canadian legalization first it was like hey you're allowed to use cannabis and cannabis oils for medical purposes only and under prescription stuff and then in October twenty twenty eighteen it was like okay you're allowed to now buy cannabis and stuff in a store and there's like all nine ways to buy it as well just for consumers and then that evolved recently into you like you're allowed to now sell like you know chocolates that have like you know cannabis stuff in them too and things beverages and like a more broad category of things that that contain cannabis for the work that we do you know in general where we're interested in making THC CBD and other cannabinoids as ingredients so we're not gonna grow anything that would be so Keable necessarily but we might you know do something that or it could end up in like a pill or in like a cannabis oil of some sort or canet have been like you know other consumer product areas depending on you know where we get the most amount of interest but I hope that kind of explains like water derivative product is when we're talking about that stuff it's like anything that's that's not a cannabis flower almost and and I'd be like from a consumer standpoint where we fit the most we hit best okay but I would I would have like one one slight caveat to that which is that we might not necessarily see ourselves as a company going you know having a big role in that direction it really depends on who else we work with and how we decide to go to market in different areas and you know the area where we definitely have like a huge you know edge in is in like pharmaceutical manufacturing where you have to have like really strict call a standards really strict like you know supply chain and it has to be really robust to kind of supply people who are actually like using this as medicine and that's where like of course these production versus planned production start to make a lot more a lot more sense that you're going to be from a genetically modified organism I think we're I think they might be like me again damn it some people were saying it's because of my website yeah I mean I scrolled down that okay yeah the little animation thing was was slowing it down right hold the whole website runs out these little animation things that's what I mean you might wanna okay well Celeste open this page although in a bit like now the freaking site hub thing is gonna have little animation do so alright [Music] yeah okay it's still very present well this is definitely gonna hurt the concurrence but that's okay I'm gonna just you know what I'm just gonna pull up your face [Music] yeah I mean it's kind of frozen hopefully the so it says screen froze audio okay so we're just gonna we're just gonna keep chatting and hopefully that'll eventually the video will catch up or something yeah yes the screen froze audio is okay I don't know what the deal with that [ __ ] is but well we'll figure it out okay so um speaking of so speaking of legality waiting for the streamed video to catch up but as long as the audios fine we can still talk about this so the the thing comes from a genetically modified organism so is there extra restrictions oh there is there like extra paperwork that you have to do and like testing before you're able to sell your product because of that or is it still relatively straightforward I mean it's it you know always like kind of it's it it's complicated it's so complicated and and yeah having a GMO thing doesn't nationally make it that much more complicated than there wasn't a moment I would say it you know we've we've had to go through a lot of different regulatory changes over the years and let me think I feel like when we first started out it was actually easier for us to do it this way then it was for us like you know trying grow cannabis plants and now maybe it's a bit more reversed I guess from a regulatory standpoint and in the end it kind of varies from every every country to country that you're thinking about and this is like you know I think I think in the old regulations it actually took a bigger level of permit to grow cannabis plants for research than it did for like chemical synthesis or for biological synthesis of THC website nowadays I think it's all in the same okay and almost so it's actually being a bit easier to work with plants and and as easy it is to work with like a synthesis and stuff but then so in that sense it was maybe easier over here but I guess when I talk about the game over again they get regulations that usually comes into play more when we're looking at you know manufacturing and sales and and what you're actually selling and you know where you're shipping your strains and stuff and where you're doing all the manufacturing stuff like that and then it gets a bit more hairy city life you know if you wanted to do so yeah so like if you're selling the because I guess you're not selling the the organism itself you're selling one of the products so like chemically it's the same thing there's no difference right like GM like organic sugar and not organic sugar it's just it's just [ __ ] Chuck but so like if you were selling like a genetically modified corn for example that seems like it would be more of a regulatory hurdle than if you're just selling a product from a modified yeast cuz I guess there's a lot of precedent for selling modified yeast because like insulin and all the other and a lot of other pharmaceuticals are made through modified products I mean even even like rennet is made through like genetically modified organisms so yeah I guess I guess that would be a little easier like it there is that that precedent and precedent already kind of yeah and there's even like I mean there's ways a complexity that go beyond that of course and this is where like it's it's been a it's part of what makes the job fun you know here every time you look at a new regulation it's always a bit different or every time you look at a new different country it's a bit different as far as how they weight might classify one thing another thing but you know I guess one day people will figure it out and there'll be like more clear regulations for everything but for now I guess it's a you know we're paving that road you know all right that make sense so so so moving on and I guess the one of one of the big question is when do you when do you expect to see the stuff that you're making in in stores for the first time like are you are you getting closer is it still away a while away or like you know on a scale of like one to ten ten being like it comes out tomorrow one being like in ten years like where do you where do you figure you are on that somewhere between one and ten oh great okay I mean it's it's actually it's funny it depends it turns very much on the product that we were working with and how we which market we end up going on first and of course like you know I would say there's a reasonably good chance that we'll end up having products available in like Canada before we end up in the US for example and and there is like a pretty you know clear route to market in you know that we can take and then have our products coming out here you know soon soonish and by soonish I mean like maybe within the next like 1/2 years kind of thing but I get to some extent again it depends a bit on our depends a lot of different things that might like you know get is there and also depends on which product we end up wanting to you know push that route just cuz each you know each can I mode is different and do we want to like you know have you know do we want to partner with somebody else or do you want to do this ourselves or how do we do manufacturing and it's always different as of things I sort of come together have to come together in order to make this all work so so that's the the long long answer to that question by the way as far as like you know what we're able to do now is already like quite good in terms of producing something that you could put to market so technology wise things like are really working and we're really happy with how how we being able to progress you know on that topic like so I guess the big question have you actually managed because I know there's a lot of like theoretical technical stuff of like you know this is how it could be done or you know there will be companies where you know they will kind of pretend that they've managed to do it and then get all bunch of funding and then proceeded to do nothing so like happiness so have you actually done it like do you have a yeah of course yeah yeah yeah so like you've you've got a you've got a yeast that makes that like makes the compound right yeah cool very very cool so moving moving on this let's talk about why yeast is preferred over say just growing the plants specifically like it so kind of from a couple different different avenues like why why I mean like why why yeast versus just you know a factory full of plants like what what is the the just like most obvious benefit intersect I think it I'm thinking like there's a lot of benefits but like what's the biggest one right because I mean there's been something if you if you went down this route right like what was the what was the thing that really made you think that like yes this is the the way to go yeah I mean the biggest thing I would say is just having control over you know what exactly you're making and all of the processes that are happening like in that system to to do manufacturing is the biggest thing there's other advantages in terms of like scale and efficiency and how you can of course like put yeast in a big steel tank anywhere in the world and they'll don't know how to grow it and stuff there's there's a lot of reasons why why used to make sense but I think having having the ability to turn off on and off certain genes to be able to produce one compound or another compound or to discover new ones all of those you know things are are maybe the one of the most interesting things for right now in terms of growing growing a yeast over going a cannabis plant or trying to breed and you guys plan to do something different yeah okay and also it's so I think it's one thing that's that's kind of interesting like when we think about growing the the plants like there's sort of a bit of a misconception that it's this like super green that I mean you know pardon the pun but it's this like green technology where you know all you need is just sunshine and dirt and you can just grow these things but like the reality is most cannabis is grown inside which means that it's grown primarily using grow lights which is actually really energy intensive like I was I was reading a little while ago about the energy requirements of this specifically the the use case was in Seattle and as they were they were moving towards legalization like the amount of energy that the city was consuming I almost doubled just to like power all the lights whereas if you're doing the yeast thing like there's no there's very minimal in the way of power requirements like it's put yeast in a tank you know keep it mixed at a bubbler like you're not you're not you know burning thousands and thousands and thousand of watts on just keeping the freaking lights on so there is that little bit of a misconception and also like all that power generally I mean because most places are dumb and don't have nuclear so it's not like you're if you relieve you like you know if you're running all those grow lights off a nuclear reactor then yeah sure it's very it you know it's carbon neutral but or even carbon negative but like it's that's an almost not the case like it's almost always like natural gas like generators that are powering all of this stuff so like it's very energy intensive so I guess I guess in that regard like the the East thing is kind of good because you can also rely on the like tried-and-tested technology of essentially it's making beer basically like that's like it's making beer except the the end product isn't the liquid it's the you know the stuff that settles out to the bottom like that's that's really the the difference and like we've spent a lot of yeah like a lot of like thousands of years basically making like perfecting the art of making beer so it's like there's that there's that you know president of like we know what we like we know how that works like you get a big tank and you do the thing and you know and also like you know depending on so we were we were talking briefly before we before we got started about what you're actually using to grow the yeast and so something that you'd mentioned was that right now you're using kind of like the ideal growth media but potentially in the future you can use things that are less ideal but maybe cheaper or more environmentally friendly or you know maybe like offshoots from other production of stuff so so can you tell me a little bit more about that like what are you using I mean I know you probably can't get into like super super specific the secret sauce yes yeah yeah I know you probably can't tell me the secret sauce but like it in essence it's basically sugar water yeah it's like sugar water with some nutrients yeah I mean it's it's a there's there's all kinds of different ways to grow yeast on different kinds of media and and you can have been fine control of all the different components in like your your media composition and part of that is what will give you like more or less maybe yield a product too and so it's all it becomes part of like that the game is to figure out how all these different things and do the science into the research to figure out what the best thing is and and get there I guess but yeah you're absolutely right about like you know growing cannabis being like kind of more expensive process it's not growing like the same way that a lot of other agricultural crops are growing that are that are a lot cheaper to grow of course and and as far as future goes I mean yeah we were I guess but yeah we gotta talk about this but for the sake of the audience yeah once I mean once you have a yeast that does this you know yeast can continually be engineered and optimized in different ways and that could lead to a lot of improvements when it comes to the efficiency or environmental friendliness or sustainability whatever costs of of the whole thing and yeah that's part of the you know among the many reasons why this is like an interesting technology and why why we're doing this is that you can you know actually have these futures exist whereas you can't just kind of like you know suddenly get a kind of as plan to start you know consuming a different substrate you know overnight where like you plants or plants like they kind of they're sort of set in their ways like like engineering a whole plant to do something different is I mean it's much more difficult than like tweaking a gene or two and some yeast yeah so actually speaking of that so the idea of like okay so being able to grow THC in a tank obviously has its benefits and it has its immediate scalability so so why couldn't you say because like suspension culture for example exists for for plants right where you can take a little tissue sample and then grow the plant essentially in a liquid where it sits it doesn't grow as like plant it grows as like you know tank of weird green sooo so so why couldn't you do that for cannabis for example I guess I mean I'll never say I won't say never like somebody might be a figured as I would somehow and get to work properly but generally speaking like we like to use because it grows fast it that you can replicate it quickly plant cells are you're taking them out of like the preneur mole growth environment and trying to grow them in these fermenters and then that's where like you had you have to do a lot of special things to the playa cells to make them grow that way and then is expensive like really expensive yeah I mean I'm not like a plant cell culture expert but it's you know you can look at different products that are made from plant cell culture and I think they end up being like you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilo gram versus like you know tens of thousands of dollars a kilogram for example or millions of dollars a kilogram kind of thing you also so I've done a little bit of plant cell culture and like the the plant media usually is composed of what's called more chic and Scoob base because biologists are [ __ ] at naming things but also it's a lot of sugar so like you still need sugar like it it's instead of just yeast where it's like you know sugar and a nitrogen source and some air basically I mean like wine like a tube a wide nutrient for example for like growing what yeast like you need like the tiniest little bit per gallon of liquid whereas for plants like you need the more chickens cook and then you need the buffer and then you still need the sucrose so like it seems like you're kind of cutting out a lot of the the middleman with the the yeast versus trying to do it with with plants yeah and I guess the other idea that's important is that when you're growing like the canvas plant grows and it produces teach seeing this trichomes and that's where the kind of accumulates you know the thing reading right student put these big flowers on the plant that that's where the product accumulates and that's like a physiological property of the plant that's like super super interesting but to get a plant cell to do that exact same like effect in the cell culture then you end up with like a much Carter situation because you know clientele culture you got like at just sugar or sells they're all like flit around there and it's not the same environment as like of course you know a cannabis flower right yeah from some of the reading of it's doing like they don't like when you grow cannabis in suspension culture it doesn't even produce THC so you'd have to engineer the thing anyway to get it to be producing the compound in an organelle like in like in an organ of the plant that it normally doesn't in cells that it normally doesn't so it's like a huge engineering challenge more expensive media and it's finicky er like if something gets in there it like it gets contaminated the whole batch is [ __ ] and then you get to start again and it's like so it really does seem like when it comes to if you're like if you really want to grow THC in a tank like yeast really does seem to kind of be the way for it although I mean then there is a the question of like why yeast right like if you just need a microorganism why yeast versus say bacteria or algae yeah so it's there's a whole interesting interesting bunch of questions that come along with that and it really depends on maybe the product that you're making and that's where like I can I could argue that for some products plant cell culture makes perfect sense to manufacture the thing but it really depends on the the product and the cost of it and the complexity of the the actual pathway and everything like that but this is also like you know part of the reasons why you can choose you can choose which organism you want to do in in many ways yeast is great because it's easy to engineer it grows fast you has a lot of different kind of metabolic parts you can play with and and you don't see as much of that in like other kinds of bacteria or in in algae or whatever else you know you have to you might have to fight harder to get it to like take up different genes you might have to fight harder to get some of the genes to actually make function properly in different cell types and or you might have to like do more engineering with the metabolism to get it to like you know do the right thing that you wanted to do right there's more questions beyond this but like yeah growth growth rate and how they react to different products being made and how well it makes different ya can get into this like fun and complicated science of yeah metabolic engineering and I mean I think there was something important that you mentioned in there where it's like you know basically like yes you could express the genes in sort of whatever organism you want but it's not enough to just have the genes there like there's like all pathways require feedstock so if you can't also mess with the genes that control the feedstock you might like have great expression of the the couple of genes you want in like e.coli but if they don't have the ability to produce enough feedstock it kind of becomes a moot point where like you're just you're just not gonna get a very good yield even if you can express the genes just fine like like e.coli are very easy to get genes into but if they're missing the the like basement and metabolism to get you the the stuff that you need for them to even work like your yield is gonna suck yeah yeah and that's like I mean so many that's where it gets to be like yeah pretty complicated interesting science I mean it's why it it's part of the fun of the scientific job I guess and you can you can have a whole two hour session just on that or something like that right so there's there's been a couple of questions asking about the pathway so we'll get into actually talking about the pathway in a little bit I just wait I've got like a list of questions that I'm just kind of working my way through so once we've kind of talked about all the the background we'll talk a little bit about the pathway closer to the end because I mean it is a very interesting pathway there's some like really really interesting chemistry in there that I'm excited to talk about and also I'm gonna be showing there were some comments about the side link like I've you you provided a paper that from a different group that is doing this and and you know one potential pathway that they're using and because I think one thing that it'll be important to talk about later is that you know there's there's there's many ways to skin a cat right like you can you can get to the same end product chemically through very different rats like their might and and you know one route that might be easier to engineer might not necessarily have the best yield and and that kind of thing so we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's just kind of keeping to the the you know talking about the the industry and the like kind of business aspects of this cuz I mean really like at the at the end of the day the only thing that makes any of this work is the fact that like you've got the you know money and backing to do two thing so where do you see the the industry going like this I mean this is a very new interesting take on the the thing that the industry I mean in in Canada within the first like weeks of them opening the industry up made millions and millions and millions of dollars so like where do you where do you see the the industry going now that things are becoming more legal and and more products are available and all this kind of stuff well yeah for starters all the products gonna be made by yeast one day there won't be any kind of this production going on anymore very soon people will still want to go cannabis in the future someday but a there's I think that I mean the industry as a whole where do I start so one of the interesting ways to think about the industry is you know looking at the alcohol industry you are the tobacco industry and see how those have gone or are going and see where cannabis like could head eventually and you can draw all these like interesting cultural comparisons between like all these different things that exist I mean as a whole it's like a lot of interesting questions that like you know everyone has to ask for themselves culturally and also black politicians have to figure out like how do they see this unfolding and and how do you see you know legalization existing or continuing just kissed or do you see it going or not and what else you know it's it's I think one of the cooler and more interesting ideas about this stuff is that you know it's this industry that's coming from this very like taboo black market into like this legalized market and if you think about like you know the way these compounds actually work and and how beneficial they are or how not beneficial they are for different you know cases and compare that to like you know alcohol for example then you know you could argue that the the health impact of alcohol is a lot worse than the health impact of like you know cannabis related stuff or those compounds that are there that are interesting well I mean like alcohol kills literally millions of people per year whereas I think cannabis is killed zero yeah I think that that's like and also like the only the only reason that like cannabis was illegal in the first place was racism Oh like like yeah back I mean was it was it Nixon I remember but the whole the whole war on drugs started as a way to basically shut down like government dissent because they knew they had nothing on the protesters so they're like well if we can just make there right so it's been it's been really you've been watching at one of the Netflix the 13th cuz that the documentary where they they really I haven't seen owe us that ones no I haven't seen okay you talked about about this stuff which is secret it's actually super cool but I recommend watching it you're gonna happen but but yeah you're right you're right it's this interesting set of laws I can devote which didn't necessarily have a solid basis of like reasoning why or it's just like general you know fear of stuff that people wanted it to go one way or another right yeah I mean I remember back in it what like while I was in university just having like casual conversations with people who were like really against cannabis like they're just like no it's evil and we shouldn't enema like I wish but at the time I didn't know that the whole reason it was illegal was because of racism so like I I'd had that like a little bit of tidbit to be like so so oh you don't like it why well you know it's illegal yes but why was it illegal like well cuz it's bad for you know cuz of racism so you know that's yeah I mean personally I'm and this is totally just my opinion I think the war on drugs is really [ __ ] stupid like just it's dumb like it's it's it exists basically as a way to funnel people into prison and then use them as slave labor like it's really [ __ ] for and it doesn't hurt anybody like like someone smoking some pot is not gonna hurt anybody like there's definitely a conversation to be had of like it's not the like magical cure-all that people pretend that it is and like it definitely has health effects like it can totally [ __ ] your lungs up and that kind of thing but it's also not the like evil boogeyman that that it's it's often made out to be especially by what's the best way to put this older you know politicians in the 70s or something like that right 70s it's still all right like like earlier yeah like politicians still think like love to demonize it as this awful like horrifying thing when it's like it's just a [ __ ] it's just a plant chill and it's cool I mean the cool thing is like how many people maybe are being convinced now of the opposite and the way that this is all being reconsidered where it's like you know you can actually ask the question like how dangerous is this really and and actually have you know science back up some of these things and that's part of you know the cool cool things that are happens in this industry and and now that is even being like you know the the leading edge of these kinds of thinkers are starting to do stuff like oh we can do like clinical trials with like MDMA or without science and treat PTSD and start to push things in that direction too which is really really cool because you can you know it started to see these new medicines that are being considered which whereas in history they would not have been considered at all because it was in the legal taboo around them and seeing this like yeah nice way of stuff in cannabis and even more like newer waves coming in like other areas too which is which is exciting too yeah and I mean as and I mean on that topic like there's other plant or well organism derivatives because I wouldn't I mean a fungus is not a plant but like you know there's all this fantastic research on how like psychedelics can be you used for like like really serious benefit for people with depression and all this other stuff and obviously like I I always like to you know put the little asterisk on that one where people get a little bit too excited about this and then less that becomes their only thing it's like okay like you you still probably could use some antidepressants but the fungi are good too but or you look at the opioid the opioid crisis has a can either case example where like that's something that was you know pushed legitimately by like industry and then turned out to be like the worst thing ever right like you can put them in prison for us yeah yeah it's really crazy right so it's this funny so it's nice to kind of see these stories come out and be be open and be like popping the stories and people can kind of like a look at those and say like oh yeah we did that wrong very obviously and and now we can think differently about things which is nice also there have been some really interesting research on in areas where they've made cannabis legal like the use of opioids goes down because you know people have other methods of I mean because it's not magic like it doesn't just like make pain go away perfectly like that's it's not how biology works but I mean when it does make it better and more tolerable and so like there isn't necessarily as much of that like need for like narcotics so you know that's that's been really interesting and I'm and I'm excited to see kind of how that continues to develop especially I mean especially in Canada where we were essentially becoming this like really fascinating use case although I do find it also very funny when like so in Quebec for example like they tried to make it illegal to grow the plants yourself like you could only get it from and you know they always make the same stupid justifications like we need to protect the children what if the children get into the plants I'm like well then you're with the fight then you can make first of all what child goes around just like chewing on the plants like if your kid does that you have bigger problems because it like if they're doing that with like a cannabis plant oh they're gonna have real exciting time when they tried that with anything that's outside they're going to die yeah but you know so for people who are not familiar with this the federal government set it so that each individual province could set how many plants you're allowed to grow and Quebec being [ __ ] Quebec decided to be dicks about this and decided to set that your the the number at zero but this was struck down by the Quebec Supreme Court where they're basically attempting to make something illegal which the federal government has explicitly said is legal so because they've tried to be dicks when the law got like undone and it got set to the federal maximum so instead of just like being you know kind of conservative about it'd be like you can have one plant they tried to be dicks and now it's four so like I just I find that deeply entertaining like because I mean the the people who are in and I mean this is getting into all the politics and chick which is not particularly interesting but the people who are in charge in Quebec are you know they're they're very you know that you know they're they've got that like old-school stance of like all drugs are bad and and also they're fairly racist but that's another problem for another day but yeah so that's that's been very interesting and it also it like you know they'll make the excuse of like we're trying to protect the children when in reality it's like no they just want to have a monopoly on the sales it's most of what it is but anyway so that's that's that so let's let's move on from the the kind of like politics and vitriol because as entertaining as I find it it's it's probably not super interesting to listen to it yeah you know different guests different Channel just for that yeah right I could have all sorts of people just to like you know [ __ ] on the government that's it's my favorite thing to do moving on so so actually well speaking of the government are you preparing for the eventual legalization in the US and are there are there other countries that you're also lying because I know there's like in like the Netherlands like there's some amount of it's it's some somewhat legal like so are you looking at other markets outside of Canada or like you know what's you know what's it what's your take on that yeah short answer is yes definitely looking at at its South out of Canada and and that's one of the nice things about the East system is that there are many vacuums so inside of Canada that you can leverage to do this very quickly it really like everyone Dreier like everybody well I guess we'll talk to me we'll get any more into that later and then why is different a bit but are there either wait that does the air side there is many packing facilities that you just like around the world that do this kind of stuff with with yeast and the production so yeah a lot of different uh versus we go a lot of different regulatory considerations for each different country and definitely yeah I don't know what will happen in the u.s. like we'll see how that goes I think I haven't heard too much recently about who's the next one pushing for like cannabis related legalization and stuff but there's been a lot of activity there and of course now I think the majority of states have at least some like you know legal access to cannabis and maybe that's the way that'll go will just be that all the states legalize and then eventually a federal you know government has to make a decision but it's all yeah interesting exciting stuff to see see who will do what and there's even some like finer differences between like whether you're looking at like THC at the product or as like CBD is the product and then whether you're going like hemp or whether you're going like cannabis and then it's also gets a bit funny but yeah a lot of a lot of interesting lot of doors that are that are opening very cool very very cool I mean I personally I look very forward to seeing it it all get legalized in the States just because it's I mean kind of getting back into politics it's like it's just funny watching the like old stupid politicians being like there's Brad whereas like I think it's it's the like a significant majority of Americans are like no this is fine the [ __ ] you talking about like so you know that's that's been very interesting okay so let's get into some of the the more technical aspects of this and you know fingers crossed that as soon as I tap off of Skype that the stream doesn't just [ __ ] the bed but okay let's let's start with the the simplest cuz it was something that you sort of just mentioned um when it comes to actually growing the yeast like what does that look like like so I mean it's it's some flavor of bioreactor I assume but like what what does that look like is it a big steel tank is it you know smaller little reactors like how is it is and like do you is it gonna be grown in like a large batch that you then harvest or is it something that you're kind of constantly pulling off you know small amounts of the yeast and media like howhow are you looking at that like what's the because i mean like you said it like you said that it's not like growing beer so growing beer you do it is as big batches so I guess you're doing kind of constant systems no not necessarily and that that's something I'll defer to like you know we it's it's pasta development it's like a workflow that you try to figure out like what's the best way to make something and and maybe it is by doing a batch maybe it's by doing a continuous like extraction process there are different ways to to go about it and and it's a lot of stuff that you know might become like trade secret stuff will become patentable stuff one day someone get too much into exactly what we're what we're doing but it is fundamentally different than like growing a beer yeast where you're trying to get it to produce like you know ethanol and and you have like these you know maybe somewhat similar kinds of feedstocks that are always being used there so you know I wouldn't say we could I would say like our manufacturing will look a lot more like insulin manufacturing right where it's like a big steel tank very sterile conditions very controlled environments very controlled like media and all this other stuff and and less like a like a beer fermentation and that's like a yeah and the students we really want to go that way but I don't think I don't consult I'm just just really quickly we just had a donation from mon stead he says I couldn't afford 420 like 420 and for four dollars and twenty cents seemed a little bit too low so he donated $42 so thank you very much Mon stead greatly appreciate it so so getting back on do it I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna see if I can pull up some images of what an insulin bioreactor looks like I am very sorry if this bricks the scream and if it does we're gonna we'll switch back to the Skype view so bear with me if this if there's bricks but assuming that it doesn't then it'll actually let us look at some more images you know not not that also I just noticed that you've got a Spira card thing in background yeah which [ __ ] yeah shout-out to to Elliott Spira and Elliott both - very cool [ __ ] we talked about him on the last stream actually so okay let's let's pull some stuff up so this is the so this is the the paper that you linked to me and it says the complete so the name of the paper for those who want to follow along is called the complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in East so I mean it's exactly what it sounds like it's using yeast to make cannabinoids and included is a wonderful little biosynthetic pathway and it might I mean it's definitely complicated like it's not a you know one enzyme and then it just happens kind of thing like there's a lot of different enzymes in here I mean you can even see that on the you know some of the unlike one one side there's like one two three four five six one eight like there's like nine different enzymes just to get to like one of the initial feedstocks so like it it definitely has its its quirks but I mean the main thing here is basically it's it you get two two different products so GPP and oay and we'll talk about those second I'm just trying to keep out of the corner mud and see if the stream is lagging and it doesn't seem to be so I think we're I think we're good okay so obviously the route that your company is going down is potentially different than this like we said earlier there's lots of ways to skin a cat so which it's a very weird expression but I think about it but don't don't skin your cats leave them as they're cuter that way but you know so this isn't necessarily the pathway that you're going for but it's one example pathway so to me the things that they really stand out here are first off GP p so GP p is actually something that we've talked about in many streams before because it is sort of it's it's one of like two compounds that basically act as the the feedstock for most are not most but many many different metabolites so I've got a window pulled up over here so this is hopefully not gonna break the streaming empty but so for example I'm just gonna I'm gonna move your your floating head here so GP p is geranyl pyrophosphate basically the way that like yeast and plants and and this sort of thing will go about making compounds is very different than the way like we would do this in like a flask in a chemistry lab right so just just the thing that I've got pulled up here I'm starting with this one initial compound like you can make literally hundreds of different compounds depending on which enzymes act on it so the fact that THC is made from GPP is actually I find fascinating because it like I said it's it's something that is you know extremely ubiquitous in in biology um so in this case it's GPP inouye and so the Oh a is a little bit tonic but I'll live tall olive italic acid [ __ ] biology it's hard to browse thanks but so again this is another really interesting example of there is absolutely no reason that we would ever do this this way at a flask but like in a biological system it makes a lot of sense so you can see that it's this really weird long poly key tide this being that the ketone unit polyketide that gets cyclized into the the aromatic group so in this case you've got one long weird compound that ends up with you know aromatic on one end and a dangly hydrophobic bit on the other end and then when you combine these two so like once you've got GPP inouye like a suit is just off the top of your head do you know if away is present in yeast normally or is that something you've got to add so Oh way is not present in this normally yeah definitely at that that's that's the first first recombinant step I guess okay so that makes sense because I know GBP definitely is so okay cool so you'd have to so I guess that the orange is probably stuff that is already in the yeast whereas blue is stuff you have to add and you can see that it all starts from acetyl co a like it's it and or like hexanoic acid these are both like fairly basic simple things we actually looked at hexanol in stream very recently I think was the last week week before so you know all but just to be able to get to this end product because you need this thing you've got to make this whole pathway work which I mean that's a lot of enzymes potentially so I mean I'd like you'd like we said like obviously you can't comment on the exact way that you're going about it but like already just just to get the process going this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 enzymes just to get this first feedstock here like that's a lot of engineering just to get to this point so it's I I'm I just want to convey like how potentially difficult the thing that you guys are doing is like there's a lot of work that's got to go into making these things work and function and just just to make the end product and so I mean it seems like a fairly simple step once you get to this point like you've got your GPP you've got your Oh a and it just looks like it's too in like two enzymes basically just to get to either THC or CBD and this is this is also kind of cool like you can start with these same two feedstocks and just changing one gene dictates what your end product is which so I think that kind of leads into or harkens back to something that you mentioned earlier where you know changing one or two genes lets you tweak the the end product and so you can get these two very different very valuable products using only a small amount of modification like once you've got the like initial stuff set up which I find that very cool and I mean by the by the looks of this this is these are both the THC or CBD a and you can see that it I'm gonna make this little bigger so this is obvious you can see that there's a little T here this is not an enzyme this is just Heat okay good old-fashioned heat so yeah there's just just kind of interesting into it which to me I find this interesting because that's the exact same thing that happens in the plant like when you like it's if somebody is like smoking the plant for example that's where that heat is coming from so it's like the the it becomes the active form when you heat it not necessarily in advance so I just find that interesting so I guess actually that's I mean that that raises an interesting point are you gonna have is one step in your process like say you decide to make your product into a pill or you get is is you gonna have to like roast it at some point like is like to do that that conversion like is there gonna be a like a cooking step and like do you do you expect that to mess with your yield a little bit like cuz I mean as soon as you're heating something like you're definitely gonna destroy it a little bit so like is that something that you're you're already kind of trying to account for yeah it's part of the process overall I'd say and something that also needs to be looked at yeah you're gonna have to deal with that one way or another okay no I think there's something else that we've got going on that's like mainly gonna like you know kind of find an interesting way to cut around that but I won't get into that but basically yeah I mean when people make like cannabis oils for example like you you're extracting from the cannabis plant and then you're ending up with like you know a THC a in this like oil or whatever and then you you have to heat that to to get it to be like decarboxylated and then you actually have the active ingredient in the oil because normally you normally use smoked cannabis right that's where I get me carboxylated but like I'm making an edible like it gets decarboxylated I mean a lot of people will do it before they even start the cooking process but a lot of the time it just happens in the cooking process so it's like at some point you got to put that that energy in there to like knock the blonde off yeah yeah I guess so and there's a lot of actually interesting things beyond that when it comes to like using just see th CA and CB da in their original forms as like more like therapeutic products but you know usually when people talk about these compounds are talking about THC and CBD as being the ones that are the active you know things that that people really want to use that will have like kind of an impact right but you might even go to find more things beyond that so actually speaking of this light so and I mean of course you're you're free not to answer if this is but is there a like because I mean THC and CBD are they like really famous cannabinoids but is there another cannabinoid that you find particularly interesting like something that you're thinking of maybe pursuing one day or has interesting properties like are there any that stand out is basically what I'm asking let me think there there are many best and it would actually maybe I'll think for a second and then come up with something that ferno's maybe more specific but let's see I mean one of the if gonna look at something interesting that's what we're talking about is like a recent publication with a compound called THC they gave it a name which is a bit silly but THC P I guess which most everybody things cuz you never know what's gonna come up yeah hopefully you'll get this paper which is which is talks about this compound just a slightly different variation on th see that that apparently had some kind of like higher affinity for like the receptors which doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be like better or worse than then THC originally was its but it was like kind of a funny headline to see that come out and then like be like oh that might be like an interesting thing and and then but in reality if you know you're gonna file chemistry you'll be like oh cool that's nice to see that they've proven that and like cell lines and stuff maybe you got on transit to humans then it could be an interesting target but do we actually need a stronger form of THC like maybe not really okay with the regular form of THC that's right that's really interesting kinda like they're like it's it does the same thing it's just stronger like yeah and actually if you want to get into like the history of this whole like industry and it's the the perspective of like you know compounds that are stronger or weaker or whatever it's all said this is you is this found in the plant like as far as this synthetic as this found in the plant so you could I think this is one that the recent so we've seen minor camino it discoveries so like you could breed the I mean this would be a shitload of work but like in theory you could you could breed plants for this cuz I know that like the actual biochemistry of the plant itself like you kid there's a there is a hard threshold of like how much THC you can actually get in the plant before it just dots so like I think it's about 24 or 25 percent it just it plant gets real sad at that point like it does it doesn't like it yeah so I guess that that that raises a really interesting possibility of if you could breed this stuff and select for this rather than the traditional THC you could get more potency in the same amount of like gram for gram worth of stuff and and kind of surpass that strength threshold which sounds kind of [ __ ] like 25 percent cannabis is already very strong thank you you'd have to be like have a heroic tolerance to be able to even like deal with that casually without it just knocking you on your ass for a week but you know hyperbole obviously but like it's that's a really acting concept as as people like especially now that it's legal and people are able to study this more that it'll open up these like new discoveries of like hey you know maybe we've been selecting for this the wrong cannabinoid all these years maybe there's you know maybe there's something better so that's that's really interesting and I think it's yeah I mean it's like one difference of bond-like it's a trans instead of a syst bond or something like that's that's yeah wild you could get into actually I had two things to say on that one is that it's it's a fun thought experiment think about like why why wasn't this compound not already selected for in the book history historical of like you know use of cannabis like people say like oh yeah you know kind of busy be so much weaker like years ago and then people selected for it now you have like these high THC strains or whatever but why why wasn't why it was THC P not the high you know high THC strain or whatever and I guess I'd ties back to like you know some fun name is a evolutionary geneticist watching and who can dig into this and sugar and seven or something like that but I guess like Brussels sprouts like how Brussels sprouts used to suck and then people kind of went back through all the old heirloom varieties and found ones that were not gross and so like those became suddenly this is why like there's been this weird Renaissance and Brussels sprouts so I almost wonder if that would happen with this compound like if people start going back through the old like weaker strains finding one that's much higher THC P content and then just like using that as a new breed stock like that could be fascinating maybe but this is a this is my other point there's a there's a big big asterisk there which is which is that you don't you don't want to mess with this system almost in that and that in that in that way and if you look at the history of of the endocannabinoid system I guess and you can you can google around like all the the drugs that came up for the system and basically long story short there was a compound that people try to develop which is for when you've lost them for obesity and it did hit like the same receptors that THC hits and hit them pretty hard and it's kind of like optimized for that almost like it's one ease designer you know when when you look at the the structural biology of it and you designs things right and what ended up happening is that that drug got to mark it and then got recalled and eventually cut out I think altogether just cuz it was one of the big side effects was like really hard depression suicidal thoughts okay so you can look at the story it's the park is called Ramona bunt and think it was Sanofi that that was the one working on it and I don't get into the too much of the complications of how big firmer works but basically yeah you don't you know they want to have this compound exist and and have it you know be the main driver this industry because you might start to see those kinds of things and that also gets into the argument of like you know the term like synthetic cannabinoids which are like you know chemically synthesized compounds that are hitting the same receptors but they're not TV and also you need enough coming from plants and just these new compounds and that's where like yeah you have these stories of like I think it was the bath salts stuff that was a huge controversial in these new black market drugs that are coming out and causing all these problems so I mean THC is good because of the history of it like there's literally thousands of years of safety data in the sense that like people have been using it for thousands and thousands of years whereas all this new stuff you don't have that like historical precedent so yeah maybe THC P is way stronger but like like you say it could have horrifying side effects that maybe that's not what you want necessarily so that's that's really a thing that but I mean you could say yeah but I I look forward to those clinical trials like yes like but this is also the most fascinating so interesting things about this the endocannabinoid system thing right it's like this this system of receptors that you know does it seems like it has its hand in a lot of different things related to like human development related to like psychosis and all this other stuff obviously but there's there's it's still people are still trying to piece together these different receptors and how they all work together and whatever else it's not like a super simple system and for example like CBD people like CBD doesn't hit these two yeah you're looking at I guess looking at the live stream but I know this is like a few seconds behind so I'm like I don't know where we're at now see you on CB t receptors if you look at those receptors in like what hits them that's not like it's not like if you hit the cb1 and cb2 receptors harder you're gonna get more or higher or whatever you might just have like you know worse things happen is sometimes it breaks yeah yeah and then that then you had like these yeah stories that people using cannabis for things and so it's like this weird all those like weird backwards stuff happening with this this plant and what people are using it for and how that might one day become like mapped out from like a receptor standpoint but for now you know it's still a lot of science that's being done a lot of figuring out like how each compound works with which parts of the you know I like the biology and humans that it's hitting and it's one of the big challenges and I think if it was a simpler system than like you might not even have a as much attention towards this this stuff but because it would be solved to kind of cook the meeting but anyways right I mean it's fascinating I yeah and I mean this is this also like that that really does touch on the like I mean so I took a like a pharmacology like pharmacokinetics course at one point also just we've had a couple of donations that are like 4/20 themed so we just somebody donated four hundred and twenty rubles that was so thank you but you know so it and it was it was really interesting that like you know there's a few main like targets for for drugs generally but it's these tiny little changes can be like the difference between something working really really well and also having a horrible side effects and especially like when you get into the like generic versus like the original thing like sometimes they'll just like stick a functional group on a on a compound and technically it is equivalent and so you know they can there's basically like these these weird examples where if you stick specific functional groups on things like you can just barely shift it enough that it's not patent-protected anymore and you know because it's so similar you have their amount of clinical trial that you need to get it approved is way lower but because you've added this functional group there is the chance that like it might have been really important and then like it can have wildly different effects and so like that can be really really tricky and that's why some people will have [Music] like you know really unpleasant side effects when they switch from like the the name brand to a generic so that's really interesting I'm sorry that we just had a question it says all trips down is this more cool than economical so what do you think is this is this more cool than economical I don't I don't think so I think it's I think it's well you know I mean it's not really cool any cool pretty cool but I also think like it's very economic like my drawings also very very cool like Hank of THC and like swimming around in it sounds entertaining but like also it sounds very valuable yeah I mean I mean very quickly it starts to get a yeah sometimes my depends on my my days like sometimes it feels more cool but but it is still very very cool we got her yeah like I mean the number of days that I've been working on the spider silk thing and I just want to like light everything on fire just you know switch to gardening well I think it's a thing it happens but no okay cool so I mean that's no sort of what I expected like no but one thing just to quickly come back I'll correct you on this that the generic generic versions of a pharmaceutical product are supposed to be identical like factually identical I think what you're talking about is something called biosimilars where it is like a slightly different modification and gets around these like patents and then you end up with like maybe different different effects and but I don't want people to start buying brand-name drugs and that's really changing the economy but that direction is not like a good thing necessarily for like the the main compound isn't necessarily the difference like some sometimes in a generic like the the main compound is the same but they might have added a different like filler or something that [ __ ] with the exact behavior of the hill in the person not that not but I mean that's not to say that a generic is worse than a brand name I mean it is I mean I'm like I'm on a generic and it works just fine but there definitely have been cases of just I mean it's it's biology as soon as you [ __ ] with one thing like somebody's system is gonna respond to it differently so yeah and I guess there's a there's another interesting area of like experimentation that's just around like hey like can we take like yeah again I used to keep these apples DTC is available in like as a pill you can get like THC pills under prescription and so it's a product that exists it's usually used for helping people with appetite and symptom management when they're going through chemotherapy you can also get something that's called Sativex which is a product from a company called GW Pharmaceuticals and that's like a it's actually a cannabis extract that's I think CBD and THC together also available under prescription for the similar kinds of situations and then just recently there's a newer one that came out which is actually a liquid form of of THC essentially which is just like I guess it again it'll get absorbed differently it'll it'll maybe react a bit differently but it's you know all variations on the same same sort of thing and maybe in the end this is better for consumers because you just have like all these nice options that you can choose from and if you if you can't swallow pills and great and take a liquid option right and also I mean either with like speaking of THC specifically like I know lots of people who are totally fine to smoke it but as soon as you put it into an edible they're like nope I'm I'm done like they'll they'll have like you know heart palpitations or whatever whatever the case may be like wildly different effects even though it's exactly the same compound like that that delivery mechanism really can radically change just the way your system responds to things and I find that fascinating I mean it's it's totally not necessarily fun to experience it firsthand but but from like a detached scientist perspective like no this is fascinating apparently if you deliver through one organ it goes this and you know that kind of thing so like that's a find that fascinating totally yeah and this I mean the crazy thing about the cannabis industry specifically when you think about that stuff is that you have so much experimentation already happening when it comes to like you know the different edibles different oils different ways people are dosing themselves at the stuff like both illegally and and legally I guess and that's that's what I mean where things start to yeah it's a little bit backwards where you have a lot of first-hand experience that's coming back and being put into like the pharmaceutical industry maybe and then people developing products like has a reaction almost but yeah I mean like especially because it was illegal first like yeah and and that whole the whole culture of it developed whilst it was illegal and now they're trying to like you know back propagate that essentially like I mean I remember when like concentrates were first becoming a thing and I mean cuz like hashish has been around forever but like the the like the butane extractions and now the the co2 extractions and all this kind of stuff like we have lots of data on what happens when you interact with the plant but we don't have a whole lot of data what of what happens when you're like literally just taking in the pure thing so you know that's that's been very interesting that now there I mean know that it's legal they can actually study this [ __ ] properly which really is what they've needed to do the whole time and like I still think it was done that was illegal the first place but like it's I I hope that now especially now that they're looking at other things like MDMA ketamine all those kinds of things and looking at them for pharmaceutical or like from a pharmaceutical standpoint like I think it's I think people are kind of learning their lesson from cannabis and that like you really do need to like get as much studies done as you can but because I mean inevitably it's gonna be applied to millions and millions and millions of people so you know getting getting as much of that info in advance before you have to find [ __ ] out the hard way is definitely definitely valuable so I think that's yeah yeah so like everybody's learning a bit from how this is uh this whole industry is developing and you know what and this is like why legalization is also such a complicated thing we're like yeah sure it's a you know statistically or whatever else economically you can think of all different reasons but also like you know the hope and dream was that you legalize cannabis nobody gets hurt right but then in reality maybe some people do get hurt and then you have to you know deal with that I guess and I don't know I'm not an epidemiologist or like a policy analyst or whatever else so I kind of can talk about these things and not feel like I'm trimmers are supposed to do anybody I guess yeah and I mean that's the rest the responsible thing like I mean there's there's nothing worse than somebody pretending they're an expert and then being wrong yeah or like I mean there's actually funny if you everything so it's it's all it's all super cool it's all really interesting biochemistry if you want to like you know think another funny thing about you know cannabis legalization stuff I think one of the points that I remember being a the age at which you're allowed to start buying cannabis in Canada was one of the ones that maybe was the gay bigger conflicting point when people had more flexibility on how they wanted to do that and that was like very much a on one hand I think the science was saying like not until you're 25 or like there's like a task force out coming together with within Canada it kind of said like yeah we should set the age here but then the federal government decided that actually should be kind of either 18 or 19 and then of course Quebec I think is 18 and then other provinces are 19 it depends on how they how they match it I mean Quebec is trying to push into the 19 actually I think they wanted to put out like 21 like they really wanted to push it back yeah and actually legitimately that could be the right thing to do of course and that's that's why I like the task force recommended to 25 or whatever something higher and then but I think that might have been I think one of the main arguments against that was that actually you know a lot of the use cases of illegal cannabis end up being that age smaller age range anyway you kind of want to be able to address that with like the legal market and then it becomes an economic decision rather than like a health care one but and also like if you try and restrict it to 25 then you end up with the exact same problems that you have with alcohol or cigarettes or any of the other things it's like yes technically it's illegal but if it's available people are still gonna get it regardless and like I mean it was and that's the thing it was illegal for a very long time and it's not like people in who are like 15 or 16 have any real trouble getting it like it's a thing so you know that's I suspect that they probably took that into account as well like it's like from a science standpoint like yes you should avoid it until at least 25 so because then it can sit as you know interactions brain development and all this other stuff but then from like an economic standpoint and also just a legal standpoint and a like functional standpoint like how do you actually keep it out of people's hands and like because if you make it illegal and people are just gonna get it anyway like now you're just running right like headfirst right back into the same problems you had when it was legal where now you're gonna criminalize people for having it when you know like it's a kind of a personal responsibility thing and also like they're gonna do it anyway so like I think it's one of those like yes you can put out the recommendations of like but you really shouldn't but people are going to anyway like it's yeah yep so it's super interesting super complicated but a part of what it boils down to and this is I mean it's a nice thing to say cuz we have like a big audience here I guess I can say like hey you know when it comes to using this kind of stuff or anything in general in life just like try to be healthy you know you know like you've got you'd be probably everybody has friends or heard of different kinds of people and how they use even like the more psychedelic drugs and you can hear people using those things like really responsibly and having like you know experiences that make sense but of course if you don't do that responsibility responsibly then you're gonna have problems or they're obvious like you know situations that you really want to stay away from like you know you could you could easily argue that you know maybe actually I don't think stupidly like I would say actually a good thing the point that I can point to is like difference between like the culture around maybe alcohol and in different countries yeah where in the u.s. it's a lot higher drinking age in Canada it's a bit lower and in Europe it's even lower and then you have to think about you know which nation that has the most sensible policy and it might be more of a cultural thing where like the people in you know grow up with the right kinds of education and the right kinds of like understanding culturally of how to use alcohol safely or or how to enjoy it I rather than like abused it obviously and the same thing to some extent applies to the the Canada some use a whole and I think that was one of the you know dreading dreaded things about people you know legalization happening is like how many people are going to end up abusing this reason it's the wrong way and having a really bad you know effect and then and then they have to repeal everything which is you're fortunate things happen like that all sorts of problems also sorry not not to cut you off we just had a really big donation so I just need to say a huge thank you to Jack for you we've we've actually just hit our fundraising goal so that's super cool so on the on the next stream we'll be starting the next one thank you so much greatly appreciated I'm glad you enjoy the channel okay so it's back to the back to the discussion at hand sorry I was really exciting I've been so I don't I don't know if you I mean you can see it in the thing the donation goals are I've finally decided that I need a new editing computer because I've been using the same laptop for like five years and it makes very angry noises when I'm editing it doesn't like it so I'm building myself a like a proper tower so just I'm like doing I'm just doing the fundraising like piecemeal cuz you know I want to get good components and I want to make sure that I don't have to do this again for hopefully five or six years yeah you know doing that is greatly appreciated all the people who've been donating by the way super awesome so yeah very very cool so I'm just I'm gonna have just a quick peek into the end of the comments cuz I mean I think we've we'd actually gone through my whole list of stuff that I liked you know we've pre-prepared I don't I don't actually yeah I think we I think we've basically covered all that so I'm gonna just go through the comments and see if there have been any interesting and and also guys if you if you have comments or questions that you want to ask Kevin now is the time so yeah this so let's let's see what we go [Music] this is as soon as you do that like the like comments flood in faster so like as I'm trying to like read one it just the thing keeps moving on its own and [Music] [Music] I mean it's been a lot of like bickering I'm not actually seeing any any good questions yet hey come on like you know now is your opportunity opportunity of a lifetime asked asked the the magical east man some questions I you know I the thing is I saw some some earlier so I'm kind of like scroll up to it to see if I can find them I mean there's there's definitely been some some questions about like you know could other drugs be made this way and I mean the answer is is sort of a resounding yes but it also depends like you can't make LSD just because that's a weird like weird chemistry it just doesn't work but you can make psilocybin and there's been some very interesting papers we were talking about this a little bit before we got the the stream started where there you could totally make psilocybin with yeast you can you can take the genes out of the fungus and express them in yeast and works just fine but you know then it gets into the difficulty of the engineering process and a lot of that stuff oh actually there was one thing it was so you know you're you're selling or you're looking to sell the derivative products so the actual like oil itself but have you considered just sourdough well because I mean then the yeast is dead like you're no one's gonna be you know stealing your intellectual property if you're selling it it's like toast but but is that something that you've considered like or is it I think there's I think there's a some some of the articles that we get featured and had like a picture of bread and then has a quiche or the marijuana leaves on there something like that until I kind of it's just as like a header for like a article or something anyways yeah thought about this I think you don't end up with enough yeast in your dough or in your bread in the end that it actually be interesting in any in any way that's sorry what about like Marmite I mean barbecue grubs but it would do the J like it's not to say that like you know we'd concentrate is any better like yeah I mean if that's something you're looking at like rather than going through that like whole much more difficult process of like purifying the compound like would it be potentially easier to just like make some weird THC Vegemite technically yeah it might be easier to produce a yeast that way but I think you know coming back to like the different processes to use things I don't think you might get enough actually do you think for a second anyway the triceps we thought about this a bit and and but I think it starts to not work actually it starts to break down when it comes to like maybe which yeast is actually used for these different things and like you know do we actually want to try and you know will that Marmite that we might make with our yeast still tastes as good as the Marmite that because I mean because you play so much with the metabolism of the East and the types of yeast that you're using then you might actually end up in this spot where like it really doesn't make any sense to try and do that and and it might be even like fundamentally impossible to like have the metabolisms work you know in such a way that you do end up with both scenario as possible actually and and this is why also like you can't just throw this into like a beer fermenter and get the same amount of product out you but you need some maybe some fire control or different kind of conditions that are gonna really turn up those yields okay so here's an interesting question I've been seeing some questions on like a like a biosecurity standpoint like are you worried about the yeast ever getting out like how are you gonna be controlling to make sure that like nobody accidentally because like if somebody else got a sample of your yeast like they could totally make some but like do you have I mean obviously you're not gonna have to comment on like the specific what are the security features of your warehouse and yes yeah is this something I mean I assume this is something that you you take fairly seriously and this is something that is is on your mind so it is it is something that is on our minds definitely thought about before you know if it were to get out then I think there's it's just get more technically difficult to grow this kind of yeast and that's where I would be like less worried if somebody on the street like happen to get it you there's different this room I could argue different reasons like why it's like make sense or not in the end we're just very careful with how we handle westerns at least and I'm just not gonna let it happen okay but I mean that's that we're only one of a bunch of companies working on this stuff so maybe eventually there will be somebody who does who does get the Jews released and I think I think that's it's a common question in like biosecurity in general is like how does this work and what happens here or there and and maybe hmm I mean have you heard of the the case of the the phage theft but I think we might have talked about this at some point in you know months ago but so there's this with and obviously this is not a one-to-one comparison with yeast because they don't they're not a virus they don't just get on everything but there's this really famous example of there was a lab that was working on a phage that killed a particular type of bacteria and another lab wanted it and you know had sent them an email be like hey would you set share and they're like no so they sent them a physical letter like I'd like an actual like written like please can we have a sample of your phage and so because it was a written letter they had to respond with a written lit written letter so somebody from the lab that had the phage wrote them a letter and was like no sorry we can't give you a phage and then the the lab that wanted it took the letter like sterile e blended it and just plated it and got the phage because there was a little bit like just from the being in the lab like it was just all neatly present and they managed to isolate it off of the piece of paper so like it's a file right like is so is that something that you might be concerned about like are like that may be someone in your production plant might get some on them and like you know so it was like hey man I'll pay you 10 bucks if I could swab your face or whatever like is because I mean that that seems like it could be terrifying from from like a security point of view so yes I guess you but but then again it's also with the yeast so let's someone's like sticking their hand in the VAT like this isn't really like a problem and you wouldn't do that anyway because it's got to be super sterile and all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah basically yes yeah you know it's not it's not so easy to just like get it and then grow it and then you're off to the races you know there's if you are really really smart biotechnologists that maybe you could try and like do something bad but I think we we just it's just part of being a company and having really good security protocols for handling all this stuff and getting gun situations and through it properly so it's not like something we haven't thought of or something that we're like you know particularly susceptible to and yeah you can almost you can also imagine it sort of like the same case where like like Humira or whatever is like this 11 billion dollar revenue drug or something like that imagine if somebody stole the strain that produces Humira and tried to produce that you know on their own probably the company that makes you mad will find out and then also sue the [ __ ] and then you get into trouble yeah but also you might you might have just have like a much does not grow the way that it grows the when we wrote it and then then you end up it's like just it doesn't snot feasible to actually like get a strain that way I mean and I guess like they'd have to be intimately familiar with your process because I assume it's on some weird selection agent with weird media and all this kinda [ __ ] so like unless it was like an ex-employee who like stole a sample and do the recipe and like we're getting into like Willy Wonka territory it's like I will pay you $10,000 for a never-ending Gobstopper kind of thing like yeah the park is like that isn't it yeah right exactly yeah well we all know what happened to the guy in dress the park right yeah I mean the thing is might have not actually seen Jurassic Park so oh really uh which I feel very stupid because like I'm I for all the [ __ ] that I do I really should but I I think it was one of those like it was the best way to put this I have a very low suspension of disbelief threshold and that one does in like it's like the concept doesn't work so like I it's it's hard for me to enjoy it because I'm like that's not that's not that's not how that works that's not how a anything works also like the like then there's the and this this has nothing to do with anything but like the the dinosaurs do not look like that like all of the which admittedly was an older it like especially the original one was an older movie so like some of the newer research where like most dinosaurs had feathers like hadn't been found yet but I just I wish they'd had a big feathery t-rex that would have been so much more fun like so yeah that's that's the thing but I know I'm gonna take a lot of [ __ ] for not saying Jurassic Park so now I'm gonna have to go from now I'm gonna have to go watch it but yeah anyway okay so let's let's see what other what other questions we've got I saw it because I saw a couple interesting ones goodbye I mean there's so there was also a couple of questions from the like offhand and you can't make LSD thing and the reason is that it like LSD is not a biological part like the the precursor is so either like the ergot derivatives or LSA or all these other things like those things can be made bio synthetically they are made by lots of different organisms it's it's that last step where you like take the precursor and actually like chemically transform it into LSD that you can't do by I mean as far as I know I could be wrong maybe somebody's made some weird freaky enzyme thing that does it but like as far as I know there's no enzyme that does that that last switcheroo so you make the precursors be like I mean you could totally make a yeast that makes her got her got amine or LSA it's just the the that is that last step that you just can't do [Music] [Music] oh so so what a question why yeast over algae because algae is also something that's that's typically thought of as you know being grown is the in these huge facts so is there any particular reason why you would go for for yeast over algae like what are their like are there any specifics uh yeah I mean we talked about a bit about earlier but it's kind of depends very much on like process metrics and also like the science going into like how you actually can engineer that organism so for example like the yeast metabolism is fundamentally different from like a holiday metabolism and you could argue that the yeast metabolism is more suited to producing these particular compounds because it has look you know that active you know this was precursors that are need to go into this pathway for example I assume you could get an algae to do this stuff which again there's differences in how you how a yeast will react with like you know being recombinant and having DNA in it versus how in algae would and that's where like this is pretty reliable the so after you've engineered the algae let's say then you can think about how you're gonna grow that and how you're gonna separate out your end product and you know if you think about algae you're more likely thinking about like white and co2 getting into to make it grow faster or better or whatever and that's where like you start to hit some hard like physical limitations you can't get more more light into an algae tank like you can't add more sugar and add more water and that's like even really fast and get it to high density cultures that are really efficient but the algae situation can be more complicated and then you could get it argument like oh but you can grow algae off of sugar too and then right I'll leave it at that like yeah it's processed yeah it is the process in the end and you know yeast is a pretty familiar process and very efficient process and a very vigorous process and then algae you may be like West less so okay I mean I and that makes sense also from from what I know like just the actual engineering of algae is more difficult like it's there I mean they're just kind of they're picky organisms and there just hasn't been like yeast has been extremely well studied because it's used for pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff like there's literally textbooks on all these different kinds of yeast strains on how to and how to engineer them and how to work with them and how to grow them whereas algae like we're good at growing it but actually like messing with its genetics is hard and just things don't don't necessarily cooperate so oh so have you looked at all at terpenes because you you know you've got the the THC have you have you thought about growing the you know the the flavor to go with it or is or are you more focused on the actual like pharmaceutically active compounds definitely more on the the active compounds there although some of the terpenes are starting to let me show some promise of in terms of being actual pharmaceuticals - okay but it that also like those are different pathways that are going to be different you know it could be made more easily by chemistry or extracted from another natural source and then it becomes there's already a process that exists for some of these ones as well like I think women even is it maybe is one of these ones that like limiting this kind of becomes by its industrial chemical it's also forget it yeah yeah we have lemons there's yeah so you know you don't need a yeast that can produce eliminating maybe where you could argue that and work at the economic I have that does that actually okay I got the only reason I haven't tried it is because there's no I think it uses uracil dropout media as the selection or like dropout media with with Europe no yeah it's you're still drop of media so it's it's missing uracil and I just don't have that like I don't I don't have drop up media so it's the only reason I've tried it because like oh my oh my yeast engineering tends to be using gee for Nate just because it's easy and g418 is cheap and drop OBD is expensive and annoying although actually so I bought some tryptophan dropout media I didn't even I didn't even want it I wanted the I came as a I got it as a kit from Carolina they sell the their bio builder kits one of them is a keratin yeast kit and I just wanted it I thought the kit came with this is actually really frustrating that so the kit was supposed to come with pre-engineered keratin producing yeast and that was the only thing of the kid I wanted they don't sell it separately you have to buy it as the kit so i bought the kit and the one thing that was missing that they forgot to pack was the pre-engineered yeast I was so annoyed but it came with a bottle of tryptophan dropout media so I'm like alright well now if I've got anything so I found a plasmid that that's Curie recombinants and the keratin plasmid that I currently have has loxp sites next to every single gene so if I take my pre-engineered yeast that I've already managed to make and I'm you know throw in the the creep plasmid which is on tryptophan selection I can now use that media to make like an integrated version of the thing and then I should actually get like really weird like color differences because depending on which one of the genes is running and in what quantity like you'll get different colors like if the if the keratin synthase stops working but the lycopene synthase is still working you get a red colony whereas if you've got both they look orange whereas if you know you get really low lycopene and really high kara didn't looks yellow so it's all this kind of stuff so that was just something that happened recently but like all so it's it's a very interesting thing of like you know when you've got all in like when you're trying to make a product that requires more than one enzyme like it's very interesting to see the dynamics between them so like especially with something like THC where you've got anywhere from four to eight to ten enzymes that you all need running at the same time like your your yield can vary wildly just in in small changes in the expression and like tweaking the individual enzyme so I think that's what the fascinating if you want to violations an interesting one I think that's another one of these a proof of concept kind of pathways that people like to play with because it makes a purple color and if you if you mess it up and it makes black instead then you play with the enzymes a bit yeah cool and so I'm not really gonna get into like talking about the specifics of Endre enzyme engineering but I suspect that you have had to do a little bit of that like the natural enzymes maybe aren't as active necessarily especially in yeast right like they're the plant enzymes for a lot of them so I assume you've had to do some work and I mean you don't need to go into the specifics but like what what does that process been like like how how do you go about that like what how do you decide like this is the enzyme that we're gonna mess with like you know do you is it done rationally or is it done randomly like do you just kind of like start messing with aminos and seeing like which ones like which end up with an enzyme that works better or is it something that like you find in research and you just try and replicate that so it's it's more like the I guess rational and and irrational approaches on I'm doing is I'm engineering stuff I would say like you know we have done is build like a really efficient way of going about doing that and that we're pretty pretty happy with I would say like our like our genome engineering or and the hydrating platform is really nice the and that's like that's what I get that's all I could save we're good but yeah I mean that's the that's the it's it's an interesting topic to kind of get into like different techniques events and some engineering that you can look at and and how I think if there's any good publications on this clear pathway in general or if anybody's really dug deep into that but anyways yeah getting a bit more technical there but yeah enzyme engineering is fun we do it do it pretty well okay yeah so and and I mean you can you can not answer if this is you know something that you shouldn't talk about but do you spend more or equal time messing with the enzymes in the pathway or have you also started looking at messing with the metabolism of the yeast generally and I this is definitely something we've touched on a little bit but like is like like is it a lot like do you really have to go in and seriously tweak the metabolism or do you more focus on just trying to make the enzymes themselves in in the pathway you care about better it's it's a bit of both and and a lot of like maybe crossover between the different teams that are working on this stuff I suppose yeah what should I say about this so actually I mean that do you have different teams in your company that like focus on the different aspects so like you know one group or some okay so you've got like a metabolism engineering group an enzyme engineering group that kind of thing and then presumably like process engineers and that sort of thing yeah yeah total okay cool how many people do you yeah how many people do you have working at your your company now like because I mean I know when it started there was like three or four you but like it's it's grown quite a bit yeah we were at about over 20 people leading into the month of March and then business is where I stood shut down and stuff and then we've made some like changes to our team since then I guess but that's uh yeah okay so but about about 30 people yeah actually that that brings up an interesting question how has the the the ye old plague affected your ability to do the thing like is it as it like interfere do the research has it interfered with production like how are you how are you handling that because this is I mean your your business is very different than like your average retail business but like it's got to have been affected so like how how has that been handled it's uh it's been okay actually I would say like so so I just thinking about something else for a second we it's been hard because like we're yeah we're kind of a smaller company that's funded from like investors and stuff like that and so a lot of like the support and a lot of like the the way the government was like funding things like you know sporting stuff wouldn't leave applied to us right away in the end you know we we we deal with money in the bank to kind of like lead through the stuff and still make some like really interesting achievements over the course of the past past few months but so I would say you know some hard stuff to deal with being a CEO at this time is like a pretty challenging kind of stressful thing anyway anyone yeah anyone be anyone beating companies through this this period is like under a lot of pressure but but as a whole I would say like we've handled things like reasonably well and and we're doing okay okay fair so actually I think this this actually leads into another interesting question you know let's let's fast forward a few years let's say you're already at at the point of scale and production and you know you've got a product on the market how differently would your company hold up in the case of you know a plague event or serious [ __ ] happening compared to like a more traditional farm like would you have an easier or more difficult time easier okay I would say I mean if you depending on them yeah hypothetical plague in the future like what the next one yeah how's it gonna transfer but I guess you if you think about like you know managing a production plant that does like he's manufacturing versus having to like you know trim cannabis flowers like there's there's interactions at that like you know you don't never have to touch the east if you're ever if you're doing this kind of manufacturing ever when it comes to doing doing this at large scales and so in that sense yeah any also doing you know need to as many staff to kind of run it like a big facility like that compared to you know the number of staff that need to like watch over the plants and make sure that they're all growing the right height and everything like that right so they I can think of all these different reasons why it might make more sense to in the future how's it become more automated right like I mean if you're if you're just processing yeast it's just liquid handling basically like yeah and so that's like right right I mean it's you're handling liquids and goo whereas if it's a if it's a traditional farm like someone has to harvest all the plants someone has to trim all the plants someone has to package all the plants and so it's also more hands-on especially in a the age of hey maybe you don't want to be touching things so you know maybe like at the end of your process it can be mostly automated and you just get like a 55-gallon drum worth of concentrate at the end versus when it's plants you still might get a 55-gallon drum and concentrate but there's a lot more people involved potentially right so that about sum that up yeah basically okay I mean one day we'll have robots that will farm all of our plants too and they maybe it doesn't matter anymore although yeah but farming robots are hard firming a robot very difficult and they're it's very expensive and I mean when you compare the the difficulty of a liquid handling robot on an industrial scale versus you know some robot that has to want like understand and interpret the shape of the plant as its trimming it and harvesting it and working that you know getting it's it's you know hokey bets up and up in the plants space like that is a much more difficult engineering challenge and and like even just computer science chomps like how do you teach a plant what a plant teach a [ __ ] teacher a robot what a plant is supposed to look like and all this kind of stuff and then you know properly interpret all the signals so that it handles it properly and have you know whatever grabby arm thing that you know it's it's a it's a more difficult challenge and it's more expensive and it's probably more parts whereas with your stuff because it's all just liquids like it's just you know turning valves and [ __ ] on and off they tank us up yeah yeah drains fast right like drain every drain into the ground we're being you to go right you know have that tank get hot that that tank is cold you know you know spin that one's a centrifuge that one's solvent you know whatever the case may be yeah that's very interesting so it's theoretically more robust so I think that's also an interesting prospect for both I mean other pharmaceuticals but also just whatever other end products and and cannabinoids and other things they end up making like it adds a layer of robustness in this in the face of the world shutting down which yeah and this is this is the heavy hitters of this in bio hype circle are all in favor of this kind of thing right we're like going good yeah grow yeast in space and then you can do it that way too right and then you have to that's just anything you want uses very true right plants do you look forward to one day sending some stuff up to the space station see if you can t need like a little like petite like you know you know they like the rackmount units they've got on the ISS you know it's like and this is our stove or oh yeah yeah you know do you imagine just having like an itty-bitty one and just like astronauts vaping in space like maybe nothing Esperanza vaping in space or something I don't know what the relevance of bad to you okay I wonder if there might be something there too if you ever wait six months you know in the void of space going to Mars yeah yeah that's something to do yeah somebody is somebody's butt actually bone bone development and degeneration maybe there's something related to the endocannabinoid system there so you might actually have a a therapeutic use okay but for science I like it no no it's your safety babe I mean maybe maybe the astronauts whether you want the video do they do they want this kind of thing up there do they even I don't know what it's like to anyways well cuz I mean they get like weird issues like co2 pockets so it's like if you'd end up like if you if you like hot box your corridor as quarters it just might just hang there okay that's so have you I mean this has really nothing to do with anything but like have you thought about the like the physics of growing pharmaceuticals in space cuz like you're like you know it's fine what it's a tank of liquid on earth like you've got gravity to hold your [ __ ] in place but like I feel like that would be a huge engineering challenge to make that work in in space like things would would slosh around and just float in weird like you'd have to like get the tube into like at the center of the liquid somehow it just did like I don't know it's just I think geometrically it would just be a very interesting a very interesting challenge to like deal with the fact that your liquids don't sink yeah I haven't I haven't really thought about it actually yeah yeah I mean that's fair although although there was I came pretty close to actually this it was a competition that that was gonna be related to some like getting our yeast strains into space as like a research experiment somehow anyway that was like a years ago that I'd tried to do this thing but there there is some interesting stuff when it comes to microgravity and yeast and other microbes and how they grow when else other stuff and I guess there's work to be done and interesting things that I guess all organisms kind of change whether you end up in that environment you know humans I mean it's a trash it also the radiation environment too so you'd have like this is something I've been thinking about like if you try and grow your pharmaceuticals in space like it's a heavier radiation environment you have a mutation it's gonna [ __ ] with your product so bad like it could like it could wreck your batch really really easily I mean there's been a lot of experiments where they try and grow bacteria in space and they get angry like they do not like it why they just they Butte ate really hard and have really nasty products are being produced and it's just it's very strange it's entertaining yeah it from like a from a science perspective it's fascinating but like I would not want to be the guy in charge of that oh man I have they done slime mold in space I feel like they did but also if they haven't they need to because that would be such an interest in your experiment yeah I wonder I haven't I haven't looked into it what else yeah space is weird space is weird stuff it's very weird I like the idea but I'll get there eventually but like yeah yeah I guess you gotta figure out I think so I still frozen at her waist I think moon is probably where a lot of this stuff is gonna end up happening uh yeah anyway cuz I mean that's that's like sorry like [ __ ] Mars thank you the the moon is where it's at and like I'm like I think Mars bases are stupid but I'm a huge fan of moon bases just because it's close and it's it's just a very fascinating thing but I I think you know I mean also there's enough gravity that like your liquids would still probably slosh around in really weird ways but there is still enough gravity that like a tank of liquid will settle and so like I think being able to grow pharmaceuticals in the way that you are will probably be very valuable technology on the moon I almost wonder if that's like because I know there's grants and stuff for for moon project I almost wonder if that's something that would be worth like you considering like if I need a grant all that means I'd be entertaining just like she very fun but III think like long-term like being able to because the only time like that sort of base would really be stable and viable long-term is when you can produce all your own stuff and like pharmaceuticals I think is gonna be one of the most difficult to produce because you know each pharmaceutical has its own quirks but I think you know if you had like a hundred tanks each one produced you had a yeast that produce some different useful thing like that seems like a really viable way of overcoming that problem in this because just cuz it'd be like technically easier than trying to do chemistry interface like well there was there was that I think it was craig Venter that was the one that kind of suggested like oh why don't you put like a DNA synthesis robot on the moon that just like spits out DNA and then you don't even have to have a yeast collection of these various type of DNA being synthesized in here yeah the presumably although that works [Laughter] I guess you could imagine that giving a a you know basic yeast strain and then you transfer me with different pieces of DNA and then depending on what you give it and then it'll it'll make a different public right and then you have to have a right in theory that sounds good but as someone who's actually done like a lot of you know toiled away at yeast transformations like it's not that easy it sounds really good on paper in practice you know but this is this is later in the future when we have a synthetic version of yeast and that actually takes a teenager yeah we yes sure first that and then make that you strain now can can I have it please I want magic yeast that makes my life easy [ __ ] I mean it like forget growing THC that would be way more valuable just magic east yeah make anything that'd be fun okay so let's let's see if there's if there's any other questions but and we've been going for two hours so like if you want to if you're ready to wrap it up we can do that let's just let's just see if there's any other interesting the question was really quick I'm just gonna like skim through so yeah you know it's if anybody's got like a you know a pressing question you know speak now or forever hold your peace we have you a minute or two just cuz I know there's lag on the stream so yeah if you've got some questions leave them in the comments and we will try and dress them but otherwise it's been fun I'm glad we finally I'm glad we finally did this this is things has been a really interesting conversation we got to cover some really interesting ground it seems people have been enjoying it so that's been good yeah I think it was I think there's a pretty significant lag on the stream so it's gonna take them a second to actually start sending some questions if they do that otherwise they're probably just gonna continue bickering amongst themselves as usually goes [Music] okay so there was one question on the stability and reproducibility versus like a cannabis monoculture it's like how's that comparable I mean I don't know that much about cannabis monoculture I would say but like I think like for yeast it's no problem that's easy you do it all the time like it's it's just part of the game for cannabis I think there's a more specific things that you have to do in order to get it - yeah grow consistently and to do that like you know for I guess you think you might be think about like 20 years that you're using this like it's same exact plant in the same exact way to make the same exact compounds for somebody to use for therapeutic whatever and that's I think you know some companies that are doing more the pharmaceutical aspect of this stuff are like you're working towards that or have spent a lot of time like mastering that one aspect of it like for in cannabis consistently and then but that was like I think that's a big challenge earlier on in Canada's industry and still is hard to get like you know uniformity across like every cannabis plant that you grow just about different different conditions that might tweak it a little bit I mean that makes sense Oh will you be doing an IP out like at some point are you looking at taking the company public are you gonna stay private for the foreseeable future yeah good question we'll see who's fair good yeah well when you do that is the question oh yeah yeah of course right a lot of I mean that's like the the whole sort of story right like what do you end up in future and it's like you know hopefully you you find a way to to keep to make the company exist and actually take it like in tests huge a successful thing and then you can decide if you want to sell it or if you want to be doing they don't want to take it public or whatever else right right yeah that's possible fair enough and this I I assume this is something that you'll only be able to be like yes or no but do you do computational analysis to predict the structure of better and more efficient enzymes I think when we talked on that we talked about this a little bit but like short answer is yes yeah but I guess generally speaking you know I did that did this work in my undergrad about like how to use computers to predict stuff with enzymes and it gets to be pretty I like despite many years of computational enzyme discovery in prediction and design whatever else I'll say that the results from computational predictions are like pretty limited yeah so so you know even the best people in the world at this science technology of like particularly protein structures are still still having a hard time with a lot of different cases right I mean that's that's sort of what I expected like do anyways yeah it's a cool topic I love it I love the topic of computation with that prediction that's super cool it is super cool it's just also enzymes are hard yeah and and all the things that we think will work don't often so like a lot of the time it's it's you know you know I've got this great idea and what if we just tweaked is one thing and or you but then you just like mutated randomly change something that makes no obvious sense to you and it just ends up working way better than like okay what right so it's like okay cool there's been a lot of questions like do you are there are there internship possibilities of your company and also like just asking about your hiring practices like are they mostly like PhD and master's student like or people with PhDs masters all sort of thing or do you have kind of more of a like a open range more more open range actually I think we've we've got like a good mix of things and and we don't necessarily you know I mean we have some philosophy where it's like we don't necessary want to hire a PhD to fill like an entry-level role of course that's gonna be more like a bachelor's or master's student that will fill those kinds of roles so you know every rule has its place and person has its place that accompany so I mean yeah that's fair enough but so you're more looking for like talent and skill set rather than like magical piece of paper I say it generally yes yeah I know that's where I'm all about it that's that's good [ __ ] okay that questions already been answered like a hundred times [Music] no okay I've not seen anything particularly interesting so I think we'll probably wrap it up there well either way thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun I know we were we've been trying to set this up for a little while so I'm glad we finally finally got it done it seems like people really enjoyed it and I mean I think we got to cover some really interesting ground I mean I learned some things this was this was really great so yeah thanks for thanks for hanging out cool yeah this is this as fun as a pleasure hopefully people learned something from this exchange here otherwise people if people have questions is there a spot that they can contact you or and do you have any other I mean there's the the hyacinth link in the description but is there anything else that you want to plug while you have the opportunity good question I don't think so I think just follow that link if you want to hang out with other people who like to do DIY bio stuff and and you can go check out Rico bio I guess that's pretty good bio and we'll I think the websites out of date now but he'll updated maybe and then even the future when people watch this they'll realize like oh yeah this is cool otherwise yeah nobody can send questions to you and I'll answer them through you maybe is it also another approach to that fair enough is there is there a contact page run on Python or is it there is but we're usually pretty slow to answer that just cuz like okay that's that's totally fair alright well thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun for the the regular viewers and the next stream should be on Monday I think we're just", "F6LdulejAbM": "up close cannabis bay boil looks a lot like honey but it's actually a potent mix of THC the chemical that gets people high diluted with additives and topped with flavorings to give it that taste and smell newly regulated cannabis oils are required to list all chemical ingredients inside and their amounts but health experts say one major safety check is missing we don't really understand that this is a different mode of delivery when cannabis vape oils are heated or vaporized they produce new chemicals so what goes in isn't necessarily what comes out Health Canada admits there has been no analysis done on those chemicals that means that they'll be going into people's lungs before they're tested in a in a vaping machine we asked leading cannabis companies if they're testing emissions from their products the answer was basically no it's not something Health Canada required them to do we work in partnership with Health Canada to meet or exceed all the safety regulations that they put out but at least one company is holding back hexo acknowledges common chemicals found in cannabis vape oils are under scrutiny for having potential negative health impacts it's testing different formulations in search of a safer product American doctors are now treating hundreds of patients with vaping related illnesses many of them linked to an additive called vitamin E acetate given all the unknowns doctors can't understand why Canada has rushed to legalize these products I am surprised that they're allowing that to happen I think that's where the jury's out as to how dangerous that can be that's why some provinces have said hang on a minute let's wait at least until the US CDC can finish their investigation so that we can have a better list of what should and shouldn't go in these oils his advice until the science is settled Canadians should consider sticking with dry leafy cannabis Kristine barracks CBC News Waterloo Ontario also as of today cannabis edibles are now legally available across most of Canada as well but people in three of the largest provinces will have to wait a little longer cannabis infused products from beverages to baked goods to gummy bears are now good to go everywhere except Alberta Ontario and Quebec which have their own distribution systems and some stricter regulations edibles in those provinces likely won't be available until mid-january at the earliest and there's no guarantee providers elsewhere will be able to meet demand right away retailers from BC to Saskatchewan to Nova Scotia say they will be lucky to have stock by the weekend due to some supply chain issues one likely

tied to one of the biggest black-market vaping bust ever in the United States state of Wisconsin versus Tyler Teja finds a confidential informant told police that Tyler Huff Heinz was the mastermind behind a THC vaping operation that started at the beginning of 2018 this is a very large criminal enterprise that this defendant began basically he began it with a hundred cartridges that he began to sell court records show 100 cartridges quickly turned into thousands every day when authorities raided Huff Hines condo in Bristol they found more than 30 thousand illegal vape cartridges filled with THC ready to sell another ninety eight thousand cartridges were ready to be filled with 57 mason jars worth of liquid THC that's where prosecutors say Jacob ha finds comes into the equation Jacob Huff Heinz did go to California with his brother brother Tyler Huff Heinz I'm with a three hundred thousand dollars in cash in order to purchase the THC distillate that was found at the condominium Tyler ha finds is accused of having 10 employees work out of his condo making 30 cents per cartridge to have them fill it and package the facts are my client got caught with a substantial amount of marijuana he did not get caught killing somebody he didn't get caught with harming someone but that's what they want you to believe Tyler Hans is being held on a half million dollar bond his brother

it's arrived in Northeast Ohio an old drug with a new twist the feds now seeing a lot more of it on streets across Northeast Ohio and Tracy Carlos live in the newsroom with another story you will only see on News 5 Tracy Frank tanita its THC an active ingredient in marijuana and it is now being used for vaping we're seeing a lot of it a lot of THC cartridges for vape pens cartridges similar to these that we found on the internet are now in the hands of DEA agents here in Cleveland it's illegal its THC it's marijuana the vape cartridges are filled with THC oil it's a chemical out of marijuana from marijuana from the plant it's extracted and it's mixed in with another substance and then placed into a cartridge and ultimately sold on the street recently DEA agent seized more than 15 thousand of them that will not make it onto the streets I would say we were surprised at the amount you know that's a lot when you're seeing you know thousands of those on the streets there have been seizures like this in neighboring states as well Indiana Pennsylvania and now here in Northeast Ohio assistant Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin told me once out of the box the drug is nearly impossible to detect can be smoking it and it's it may not be present in other words we wouldn't know you could be sitting next to somebody who's smoking a THC cartridge and you might not even know it

and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're available for

channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a

about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give

"dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "qrSDFZNt-to": "there is no denying the growing popularity of vaping pot in fact it's so popular the sales of marijuana oil cartridges used for vaping they've soared 400 percent between 2015-2016 so in one year quadrupled vaping has made marijuana use more discreet it's more convenient and it's free from the STONER stigma attached to smoking weed but and this is why we're talking about the jury's still out when it comes to the safety of vaping marijuana some studies suggest doing so may be toxic dr. sue Sisley the president of Scottsdale research institute they do conduct clinical trials on marijuana she joins us now on these findings and I'm glad we're talking about this because I will openly may I don't know about the three of you but the whole concept of vaping with cigarettes we understand but I am oblivious to the health consequences benefit whatever it may be when it comes to this so people think it's healthier but maybe not so fast you're right we don't have any data about the safety of using or vaping these marijuana oils and those cartridges up there are great exact Emma Colette when exposed to heat these chemicals can turn into formaldehyde so you talk about propylene glycol yes so you're more concerned about the additives then the marijuana oil itself exactly right yeah these chemical additives have never really been tested for safety the FDA has confirmed that they're safe for consumption but just because it's safe to eat doesn't mean that it's safe to heat up and inhale it's a different story and the fact is if there's all these flavoring chemicals in there as well you know these they try to add flavors to the cartridges to make them more palatable but what happens is that those flavoring chemicals have also never been tested and for heating this is part of the concern as well is that they look more glamorous so again it really reduces that stigma it makes it seem like it's a really fun kind of upscale thing to do right safe um and it popularizes it which i think is part of the problem right until we get more data I mean what's the take-home here for for people that are that are vaping on a regular basis the good thing is you have all kinds of other options now in these regulated markets we have the opportunity to vape natural flower so if you can find you know the the actual plant material that's not been grown with pesticides which is a common now because we have the the newly legalized states I'll have you know required lab testing so they don't allow products to the shelf with with pesticides or other chemicals but the problem we have is these older states you know the states like California Arizona Michigan that legalized marijuana years ago they did not require lab testing that's why it's so important that you're notifying your viewers about this issue because they can still find these vape cartridges so I just so I understand this if you're in say Colorado and you are a recreational marijuana user where you can go into a store in virtually any city and purchase it vaping there is in your opinion probably safer because they've actually tested the chemical additives that's right yeah and that's what we're trying to do with all these legal medical cannabis states is force them to lab test all of their products so that we can make sure to protect patient safety because you know the issue is that they could be picking up a product that does have these chemicals and and so I'm grateful that you're alerting your your viewers to this because they can avoid this they can pick up a vape cartridge that contains nothing but the what nature put in the plant now that would be the ideal situation pick up current and eventually these cartridges will not be bought by people when consumers get smart about this they'll bypass those products and eventually they'll go away I want to ask you this off the cuff because marijuana legalization is so new people who are naive to it maybe they go to one of these states where it's legal and like you know what I want to try it and they have the option between smoking marijuana the old-fashioned way they have edibles of a whole host of different types of edibles they now have vaping as an option in your opinion what would be the safest method well you touch on you know two big public health problems right are the overuse of edibles and the excessive vaping of these oils I mean the truth is these oils are hyper potent some of them contain 70 to 90 percent THC so people can easily get intoxicated on them so the key is always start low and go slow yeah - and that is buyer beware", "wnUT4-HbKog": "what's up guys this is Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products available for purchase you can check us out at discount vape pen com [Music] [Applause] you", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "5wVWXw_sawY": "hi my name's Peter with air vapor systems and today we're gonna focus on how to properly fill the C cell m60 cartridge now it's available in a 0.5 ml or a 1 ml a cartridge size we internally refer to it as the c6 cartridge so if for any reason you give us a call and you are looking for this cartridge you can refer to it as the m60 or the c6 cartridge however it is very tricky to fill there are a number of small details that you must pay attention to to properly fill this cartridge without any issues so I'm going to separate this video into two different portions the first portion we're going to identify the proper technique to fill this cartridge as well as the tools and techniques used to cap it now in the second part of this video what we're going to go into is more of a troubleshooting mode when we show you some of the common mistakes that can happen why they happen and how to prevent them so without any further ado let's begin [Music] so to begin explaining how to fill the m60 cartridge we will first review all the parts and identify each piece of the m60 so you know how they all fit together and what order they should be put together that's very important to note these should be placed together in a particular order number two I'm going to identify the tools that you'll need to put them together two of these tools are a blunt tip syringe as well as an arbor press now this Arbor press is maybe something that you have not seen or you may not have however it is available from air vapor for under $300 and it helps greatly with consistently and reliably capping these cartridges in fact it's recommended by the factory again we have these arbor presses for sale but it's highly recommended that you use an arbor press to cap these cartridges so that you can consistently cap them properly now to begin let's identify the pieces here of the m60 cartridge it actually consists of four pieces the two main pieces are here the cartridge body as well as the cartridge tip now the cartridge tip is available in two styles you have a round or a flat mouthpiece tip available these other two pieces that you see out here to the side this piece here is the mouthpiece cover it goes on after the mouthpiece has been mated to the cartridge body and this other piece over here is the bottom thread cover for the cartridge body this also goes on after you have maded the tip and the body together so these pieces last these pieces first to begin filling the cartridge properly you will first notice that the m60 here is a side fill cartridge meaning that you're not going to fill the center post in the middle although it may be tempting what you're going to do is you're actually going to take your blunt tip needle and insert it into the side of the cartridge between the center post and the the inner rim you're gonna want to use a blunt tip needle for this because blunt tip needles are not sharp and it will prevent you from injury once you have your material loaded inside of your blunt tip syringe you will fully insert it all the way into the cartridge and for this syringe I am using a 15 gauge blunt tip needle that a 15 gauge needle is somewhat wide and allows me to easily fill this using thick material I will push my material into the cartridge and begin slowly raising the needle as it fills taping taking proper care not to fill this past the bottom edge of the metal top metal collar that is the fill line for this cartridge the bottom edge of this metal collar is really where you should fill this too and not above the explanation for that will be later in this video then you're going to take the mouthpiece and place it onto the cartridge and you won't have to press it in hard all you need to do is place it onto the cartridge so that it seats it self partially and then you're gonna take this cartridge and put it into the jig for this Arbor press then all you'll do is take the handle for the arbor press and push the tip all the way down until it fully seats into the cartridge body you want to make sure that this kind of bottom edge here of the tip makes fully to the top edge of the cartridge once that is done you now have a fully filled and capped cartridge and then you're just basically going to add the two other portions onto it which is the mouthpiece cover as well as the bottom thread cover to complete your cartridge and there you have it a full m60 C cell cartridge okay now that you have seen how to properly fill in cap the m60 cartridge we're going to move into the second portion of this video where I describe to you some troubleshooting scenarios and explain the actual physics of how the m60 cartridge fits into itself so that you can see in diagnose any issue that may arise during filling now the m60 cartridge has a very unique capping system what it features is a tip that pushes down into the body and remains in place through friction the way it creates this friction is by having a reinforced rim around the top of the cartridge body and then a tapered plastic tip at the bottom of the tip so that when you place this taper tip into the cartridge body and push it together friction causes it to mate to itself and hold it in place much the same way that friction acts to keep these two plastic cups connected together now if you've ever pulled two plastic cups out of the dishwasher or maybe out of your cupboard you might notice sometimes these things can get really hard to separate well this action where two plastic cups fit together and don't come apart is the exact same way that the m60 cartridge fits to itself you have a bottom cup here with a reinforced rim this top cup has a tapered bottom to it and as I insert the first cup into the second you have this tapered bottom eventually widening out all the way until it meets this reinforced rim and with just a slight press down further friction begins to engage around the tip holding the two together now the two ways in which you can counteract that friction is by either a over filling this cup or by be getting material on the inside rim of it let me show you how this can occur so as you can see on this cup I have a fill line drawn on it this fill line is meant to resemble the bottom edge of this metal collar the top collar around the m60 that is the filled line for the m60 cartridge whether it's in a point 5 ml size or a 1 ml size the bottom of the metal collar at the top that bottom edge is your fill line do not fill past that edge or what I'm about to describe to you will occur however I'm going to explain it just so you can see it just a little bit better and see it in action using these two cups now to represent the material that I'm going to use I'm just gonna have this right here this is basically vegetable glycerin with a little bit orange food coloring in it I'm using it solely so that you can just see what's happening in these plastic cups now I have drawn a fill line on this Cup as I mentioned before and that is to represent the fill line on the m60 or the bottom edge of the top metal collar now when I take my material and I pour it into this cup and I do not pour it past the fill line making sure to not overfill what happens is I get a great seal because there's nothing preventing me from or nothing preventing the cup from grabbing itself and from friction engaging around the rim in the taper tip and you can see because the I only filled up to the fill line the material did not start creeping up the sides nor did it overfill however let's see what happens when you do overfill so I'm going to take this out here it's dripping a bit but let's overfill this just attach shall we now this situation here is meant to basically replicate what would happen if you were to fill the m60 cartridge past the bottom edge of the top collar basically essentially over filling it what happens when you overfill it let's insert this cup down again and see what happens hopefully you can see there that the liquid starts to rise up the sides as the cup is placed into this overfilled vessel here displaces the oil forcing it to go up the side so when that happens what you don't see is the oil starts actually pushing back in wanting to raise this cup up right now that is essentially what happens if you overfill the m60 what will happen is the oil or the liquid that you have placed in there will begin to push back against the tip as you push the tip down pushing the tip which will then force the tip to pop back up on you now if you really try to force the tip down this is what's gonna happen hopefully you can see all of this material starting to pour out the sides of the cup what happens now is basically this this VG juice does two things number one it's providing pressure against the cup so it's pushing the top cup out but because I've now displaced so much oil that is pouring out at the top what happens is it prevents friction from engaging around the rim to hold the cups in place essentially what the this juice has done is it's overflowed and it started lubricating the rim when it lubricates the wim there's no way that it's gonna hold you see it just comes right out because there's no way for friction to engage this is what happens on the m60 cartridge when you overfill it you either have the oil pushing back against the tip or you drive oil up the sides thus lubricating the entire rim and preventing friction from engaging to lock down that tip that's the tip pushes up and out or it easily comes out during use in order to properly seat the m60 cartridge you have to first ensure basically three things happen number one don't overfill it because if you overfill it this is what will happen you're going to drive oil up the sides or you're going to set the oil or liquid against the tip and it's gonna push it out number two try not to get while you're filling even if you can have if you avoid over filling what you're gonna want to do is avoid getting any material around the inner edge of the m60 so what that means is when you're coming in here with your syringe and you're filling this cartridge what you want to do is when you pull out your syringe do it cleanly try not to get any oil trailing into the inner rim of this cartridge or else that oil or that liquid will act as a lubricant against the rim and prevent the top from completely seating inside there and holding together that's the tip will pop out and third the most important thing which we reviewed in our vision previously in this video is to use an arbor press an arbor press will allow you to fully seat that tip all the way down and you're gonna want to make sure that the bottom edge of your tip is seated fully to the top edge of the cartridge body this is usually only consistently achievable if you use an arbor press I've heard of people with strong hands pushing them together I think hands get tired after a while and a press like this is going to be a much more reliable way for you to see if those cartridges there you have it if you have any questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail which will be reflected below and you can always drop a comment on this video and we will respond as

question what is a box behind fate this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can get a free gift with a code rough two on any product you purchased there including the Steam Cloud box mod like we used in the video today so what is a box mod vape box mod vapes are essentially vaporizers with advanced features and high-capacity batteries you get extra long life for those batteries and the extended power range that it needs to accommodate large tanks for ecig juice and also for the large puffs that many serious vapors chase after it was actually the ecig market that first popularized box mod vaporizers but because they're also great for travel with their big batteries and because they're powerful and will operate the numerous attachments for cannabis they're also growing in popularity with marijuana users as well you could find attachments for using dry herb wax as well as the THC and CBD oils and they're also compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges so why would you choose a box mod vape for one of the big removable batteries make it easy to replace or upgrade the batteries you can also keep a spare battery charged making it great for long trips and for extended use the ability to have such a wide variable wattage range allows you to use the large tanks with the custom wrapped coils the things that the serious papers and the cloud chasers go after but it also allows you to lower down the wattage to use it with the smaller cartridges and coils so you have really maximum compatibility box mods really offer maximum compatibility with attachments when it's compared directly with other types of vaporizers and not only are many attachments made exclusively for box mods but most of the others that are not made exclusively for them will work with them if you adjust the settings of the box mod appropriately and so what kind of attachments do work with the box mods so you have dry herb attachments where basically usually just a ceramic oven that's inside of the attachments for the Box mod you have the wax atomizers which are the coil atomizers that you would use if your atomizing wax or shatters crumbles and things of that nature then you have the big tanks or the ecig or ejuice tanks and these can be infused with cannabis but also they could just be your regular nicotine or just standard flavored juices and then what really makes them great is that they're compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges and so those are your prefilled THC or CBD type oil cartridges and those are really the rage these days and means that they work with those it's really great but there are some things you have to be careful of and that brings us to the drawbacks so what are the drawbacks of box mods well one is that they can be expensive compared with your standard single-use vaporizers that could be quite a bit more expensive but to most of us it's worth the cost another drawback is that there can be a little bit of a learning curve to use them because they allow you to use a really high wattage or a low wattage but if you use high wattage on devices that aren't used intended for it you can hurt your devices and so that's the last drawback that I'm going to point out is that you can burn up your atomizers if you use too high a wattage and that is specifically or particularly true when it comes to the 510 thread cartridges most of those want wattages down into two to eight watt range but you know if you put your papers up on 25 and 30 Watts you'll burn up your cartridge really quickly so that's one of the drawbacks of it okay well I hope you enjoyed this video on what is a box mod again this video was sponsored by a New York vape shop so thanks to those guys be sure you use the code rough -

special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "6cmI6BwLog8": "hey guys Logan here from o2 V gonna show you today how to fix a connection plate we get a lot of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "bXJfXSECsZ4": "[Music] as

vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market in California you can please check out Steve's EECOM that's st III is UI comm and you can find out where you can purchase those and you

cartridge a felony there's a big difference between marijuana and marijuana resins marijuana is a plant it grows in nature and while it can be intentionally grown and genetically engineered still it's not considered man-made on the other hand resins weather ink oil dabs wax shad or whatever you want to call them they are man-made Albea from a plant and marijuana resins are almost always designed to be significantly more potent than any natural marijuana plant could ever be in florida possession of under 20 grams of marijuana in plant form is a misdemeanor yet possession of any amount of resin is generally treated as a felony the way that the laws applied is clear but the law itself at present is not without getting too technical as of today and I'm sure this is going to change FS 893 point 13 the statute designating marijuana as a controlled substance in Florida does not identify THC resins so there's no statutory distinction between marijuana and resin however our florida standard jury instructions do differentiate THC resins are specifically excluded from any in all marijuana instructions thus the different treatment by cops and prosecutors setting these technical issues aside a clever defense attorney may be able to get your THC resin charge dropped from a felony down to a more manageable misdemeanor and thereby reducing your exposure from 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine to a mere 364 days and $1,000 fine just hire the right lawyer and you'll likely get the best result by the way never forget to question how it was in the first place that the cops came upon your cartridge there may well be a Fourth Amendment challenge in your case for an illegal search and seizure that said I thank you for your question I appreciate your having asked it and I invite you to ask me more please remember that at Haber PA it's all about reasonable doubt and if you like this video then subscribe we'll be putting out more sin [Music] [Applause]", "Iv_gPNVA4Os": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is my top five cartridges but not of 2020 to start off 2021 because [ __ ] 2020 i don't even want to care about that [ __ ] anymore you know so i titled this the top five cartridges to start 2021 with before i start this video any further let's take a [ __ ] hit i got this bougie on a budget cart i i was just fresh off doing that video so i may look pretty [ __ ] high because i am but let's take a [ __ ] another hit here cheers and i might i say that this is a sleeper cartridge i just found out about this not too long ago i just bought it a few days ago and tried it today uh it's not going to be on the list but definitely an honorable mention like this is the only strain i've tried that's why i like i don't really want to like put it in the top five because i had my top five already set uh before making this video but this cartridge man this is this should definitely get some praise for what the price is and for what the quality is bougie on a budget um but i digress let's get started so uh let's just get done with the honorable mentions first uh we got raw garden i know a lot of people don't consider it live resin but i still do because it has the live resin terps which is what makes live resin live resin right the terps the initial terpenes from actually freezing the plants and all that stuff but they give the higher percentage of thc that comes with distillate as well so it's kind of like the best of both worlds but that is an honorable mention also i would say maybe select i've tried a few of them i've tried one personally myself that i bought and it was pretty good uh just it was all right uh you know nothing to really that blew my mind but i've tried another one from flynn it was pretty good you know um but let's get on to it we got number five we got buddies and i wouldn't be like mad if it was a little bit higher on the list because buddies has just been the brand of the year for me but in terms of cartridges i have to put it there because they do seem to like okay well first before i start getting into the list i should mention the things that i consider when it comes to cartridges is the hardware itself the oil the vapor production uh the price not so much because that's all based on location and you know buddies for me is cheap and sometimes it's cheap for other people too but it's more expensive for other people too so price even though i consider that one of the most important factors i won't consider it for the sake of this video um and also i'd like to mention that this is my [ __ ] list right so it's just me you know i'm not the cartridge god or some [ __ ] you know it's just some guy on the internet okay so like if i don't have a certain brand or whatever cartridge in your in the list like there's no reason to get upset put your opinions down below your top five and let's get started buddies brand of the year for me but uh unfortunately they just seem to really run out quick you know but they're priced so good but like i said price in this list doesn't really uh for the sake of this this video isn't really uh as important but yes buddies is there it has that cdt cartridges it has the live resin cartridges and they have a lot of strains to this day they have a lot of strains you know and to this day peach flambe upside down cake and orange eight are [ __ ] just phenomenal the green box ones just great uh and then we got coming in at four and uh three and four can be switched i mean actually no okay no it's a clear cut so four would be nug just enjoyable it's everything you would get from a green box buddies uh just last a lot longer than buddies buddy seems for me it just lasts like two or three days you know and uh i don't know it's just i don't know but nug just enjoyable i've tried a few of their stuff i think i've tried like three i don't have these cartridges on me but i will put videos on the screen as i'm talking about them because i've tried them and uh yeah nug was uh enjoyable cartridge lasted really really long compared to buddies and just the taste was phenomenal the live resin was true to the train uh but yes that will be number four number three uh like i said uh initially that i wouldn't be mad if you switched three and four is the jetties extracts their unrefined live resin just hit you can take a look at the classiest way to smoke a cartridge video or use a cartridge video money and me were just surprised at the wedding cake that i got from them it was just fat hits tasty phenomenal hits and this [ __ ] got me faded so uh yes coming in at three will be jenny's extracts and uh number two and number one can also be switched but based on just you know people being in the game longer than the other one you know i'll just i'll leave number one as it is and but for number two is alpine and uh i mean uh say what you want about it being a new live resident into the market they initially did you know this lit and other stuff it's fire like they have a ceramic car as well it's [ __ ] phenomenal the phenomenal taste it's true to the strain as well and it's just an all-around tasty experience the ceramic heart really makes it a difference when it comes to the taste and uh obviously you know the variety of whatever voltage used to uh changes the taste as well but they recommend it maybe 2 to 2.6 i would say but yes alpine live resin second in my book let's just take a hit before i reveal number one but i'm sure you guys still know what number one is i mean it's on my old list right so cheers good stuff number one is urza to this day urza has been established as the number one you know they're the first ones to really just come through with that ceramic i could be wrong but to my knowledge they had the ceramic cards uh i know walks has it now i haven't tried walks but i've heard walks and urza are like kind of the same company so um but yeah urzah to this day had just the most dab like experience from a cartridge the taste was there the smoothness of the hit was there you know a low temp dab obviously and it was just all around a great experience you know got me high um and yeah it was just it was just good they did have a few hiccups you know they had to switch back to the non-ceramic hearts but uh i think they're uh using dental grade ceramic now so all everything is good but yes there you have it for my list i know you guys have been waiting for this and it's been a long time overdue you know so i will take one lasting hit before i end this video let me know your opinions down below on my list and give me your list as well you know you know if you want to put mario karts in there and all that stuff for jokes as well because i know that's going to happen as well so cheers so oh okay all right there you go peace out guys [Music] you", "25ZPhrmHCNs": "holy [ __ ] that one that one was hot I'm excited to have my hands on this so I can finally give it a try this is the 710 labs life resin pod I've had a lot of 7-10 labs concentrate to my day but this is totally new to me I haven't even opened the box yet yeah comes with a little instruction manual and the pot got a live little peek C logo they put it on all the cartridges I always just pull it off I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if you enjoyed the video make sure you click like subscribe for more video it's got a lot more on the way leave a comment let me know a Q&A question for a future video but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace I'll hit you with a goodbye rip", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "nwoAEQjtS1k": "Pass is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house in paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seize THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars and focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20-year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids", "tRBv42DgLsM": "hello everybody welcome back to the next episode of canada smokes my name is cody and i'm going to be your host on this journey as we check out some canadian legal cannabis products today i have another vape cartridge for you it's an interesting uh cartridge i've got it before uh it's called purple monkey it's made by a company called good supply this has around 79 percent thc it's got a fair amount of flavoring inside of it so if you're someone who likes to vape for the flavor you're really going to like one of these vapes here now the worst part about these is trying to get inside of these things these little boxes are kind of awkward so they've got a seal up top that you can bust with your fingernail you know or if you have a key or perhaps a knife if you're a redneck you might have a knife on you or if you're you have a kitty you can that has the shoots lasers out of its palms you can have it blast it run away like all the people on the beach here so and then there are these little plastic tabs on the side you push them in and then you can slide the box through all right here's our little cartridge inside once again this is the 510 cartridge the standard kind of thing you can buy 510 cartridges and batteries uh at any of the cannabis shops and they they work quite well you know these batteries will run you quite a few cartridges before they start to kind of lose their capacity they don't cost very much the batteries are only about 12 15 bucks and this cartridge was uh 35 that's canadian that's not a whole lot of cash and so anyway um here you can see the the color it's a nice light color it's an indica so it's pretty light in color for the indica in all honesty a lot of them are a little darker in color now uh all you gotta do is thread it on there just like i showed you once you put it on you don't have to screw it on too tight once it's once it's seated it's just just finger tight it's good enough you don't have to crank on it real hard or anything like that and uh these like i said before these have quite a bit of flavor and so just smelling it you can you can tell already that this is going to be a a pretty nice treat so let's go ahead and let's have a pull on it here and we'll see what we think here yep very nice flavor they uh very smooth these pens they're not too bad um you don't want to blow this stuff out your nose too much it kind of burns the nose and i definitely did a little bit of that you may have noticed that i just spliced two videos together and that is true i did the reason why is well it's halfway through no october in alberta and uh it's starting to get cold in my 600 square foot rickety 10 box house that i live in i've got a 60s mobile home that i live in and the walls are about as thick as a modern day hard wall trailer without the insulation so my furnace comes on a lot and uh it wrecked my previous video it did it sounded like absolute crap as it was blasting through so i decided that i would uh re-record hey canada so anyway these things are nice i like these cartridges and these pens these vape pens um they're a good little unit they don't make a lot of smell you can smoke these kind of more discreetly than you you could a joint if you're to burn up a big fatty and combust some flour that makes quite a bit of smell your fingers smell and all that now the worst thing is just try to get away from the red eyes no obviously you can use a lot of visine but i don't know how good that is for you either so that's kind of the telltale sign is some squinty eyes anyway um yeah you know if you're you're traveling through and you're curious about picking up one of these pens i highly recommend that you can rate yourself up for about fifty dollars and you've got a nice little little smoking pen there and um that'll last you for you know let's say a day and a half maybe two days depending on how much you smoke i know people that can make them last longer won't name any names of course um so yeah they're decent that's about all i have to say about that uh if you have any recommendations as to what you'd like to see me try please drop them there in the comments hit like maybe a sub that'd be cool check me out this is the third video going big time here maybe going to do a fourth video right away so appreciate everyone following me checking me out here um it's a lot of fun to be able to go down to the store and just pick up some some products off the shelf without having to try and find someone you know and uh make sketchy connections and sketchy places just for a little bit of chronic you know it's it's quite nice so it's one thing i'll give a little bit of credit to our prime minister for is uh the man has pretty much given us this market here that i don't think would have existed under uh a different government so there you go it's what as political as all i'm willing to

you will join me again and we'll check out some other products in this legal market that's all i think i have for now thank you very much take care", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works perfect for you for lots of cool products

some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "1vjaYwXw8Pg": "PRODUCTS PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCTS ARE WORTH PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE\nSEIZED PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE\nSEIZED AND PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE\nSEIZED AND A PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE\nSEIZED AND A BUST PRODUCTS ARE WORTH THAT WERE\nSEIZED AND A BUST TODAY.

my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "xtba40sLaoY": "Bammer TV [Music] welcome to Bamber TV cart reviews a brand new segment on the channel where we review the best carts around now we normally do we'd review x' and we will have a playlist of that in the description we are also going to make a brand new playlist for these cart reviews so very exciting stuff here our first cart review is none other than blue dreams so very excited Dave what you have to say about Blue Dream Blue Dream is a west coast legend amongst weed it is a crossbreed between blue berry indica and a sativa known as haze and this dream child amongst these two makes it a very potent hybrid and of course when you think about blue dream automatically the flavor comes to mind it's one of the most flavorful strains around so I was really excited to taste this and it really stays true to the bud it's very flavorful the oil has a night nice light golden color to it so very appealing as well now the main difference between the strain and the oil is well the oil is a concentrated version of the weed itself so this oil right here is about 78 percent THC by volume and it has a couple of other good cannabinoids and high amounts in there but then the rest of the oil is known as terpenes and that's the flavor profile but all natural flavors that are in the bud itself now blue dream is known for having a lot of stress relieving properties to it as well as depression fighting and nausea preventing busts so that makes it a very good medicinal weed alright so normally I just cut to the score but Dave I have a two-part question for you today I want to know which one you prefer in terms of the weed strain or the oil strain and also of course the Bama rating me personally Pat I really enjoy the flour from Blue Dream it's been a little bit since I've smoked it however I do remember all those beautiful floral notes especially when you use it so it's one of my favorite strains to smoke as far as my Bimmer rating for this cart I mean we started off with a really really good one so we asked her to make it known that this is a really good kart right off the bat I'm gonna give this one a four out of five okay so there you go a legendary strain translating very well to a legendary oil so that is our first cart review guys if you like this video smash the like button think about subscribing and for everything else and weed and weed related keep it here on Bammer TV [Music]", "l3AP-sl4qFc": "what's up guys it's uh keto lewis here i've got a new review for you guys um i had previously reviewed this company before with their delta eight cartridges but today i will be reviewing their cbd cartridges uh i purchased three different strains i have pineapple express which is a hybrid leaning more towards a sativa you can see the little name there in the plastic beautiful packaging by them as always so this is the clementine the clementine is a sativa and what the sativa does is it's very energizing uh it helps with mental stimulation helps you get your thoughts going it helps uplift your mood so if you have a depression or someone that suffers with it the sativa will be great the hybrid which is the pineapple express it's a 40 60. 60 of it is sativa 40 of it is indigo so what the hybrid does it kind of leaves you in the middle not too tired and not too energized it's just straight up in the middle um this is also good if you just want to get your day going by you know going out and you're not wanting to be too energized or too tired um and then we have the watermelon og this is an indica and of course the indica is famously known for the couch lock uh you know helps you relax helps you with sleep helps with pain um but yeah great uh packaging as always of course i want to show you guys what it looks like inside so uh the distillate inside is little uh amber it's really cool um look at how beautiful that is and of course as always you know i uh i love the the wooden piece on top they do a great job with that um beautiful distillate the bubble harley moves which is a good sign of course of the quality of distillate being good now vaping the vaping effects on it are amazing i get good baby production off of it the effects on the pineapple express are amazing i'm telling you their products all their products are good but with me with the pineapple express what i get from it is uh just a very balanced chill mood with um you know a lot of pain relief a lot of uh clear headedness from it which is good you know because sometimes i don't want to have all that energy and sometimes i don't want to have too much of an indica effect from just indica by itself so pineapple express is a great hybrid you get the pineapple taste of course amazing cartridge i love it but great effects on that that's the pineapple express now i will show you the watermelon og this is the indica let me open it up now of course with the indica i didn't get the indica effects from it my eyes got heavy i got really sleepy all the cartridges are highly effective amazing quality oil as always they do a great job i like i mean i just love it because if you look at it it has their brand name the wooden tip amazing vapor production you can't go wrong with it you know and you can tell they they do a really good job with the distillate you know it's good quality stuff you can tell that they take time to make it it's not just you know everything is rushed uh it's good stuff so yeah with this one with the indica yeah just heaviness in the eyes nice body high very relaxed i feel like watching tv when i'm on it very good stuff um and then next we got the clementine let's open it up and the clementine like i said is a sativa they're all the same color distillate um now i tried this one for my workout and let me tell you it did give me energy um the energy that i get off of this and the the motivation it almost gives me this motivation and it gives me a better outlook on life which is pretty cool um i love it i mean it got me up and going um this was some coffee is amazing the flavor on it is amazing it tastes like clementine that you're eating at clementine and i forgot to mention this one this tastes exactly like watermelon um but going back to the clementine amazing taste amazing effects all three cartridges are just top-notch um the good thing about this company is that you can find other lab tests online everything is tested so you don't have to worry about any heavy metals or pesticides everything is thoroughly tested and they're american-made which is nice in california can never go wrong with that support american businesses [Music] and then that's the cartridges they're all great love them i give them a solid 9.5 when it comes to the cbd um i have tried plenty of cbd cartridges and these are definitely raining up there just solid 9.5 definitely go for it now the gummies i haven't tried it it's closed um i'm going to wait for it because i already did this 30 to 5 to 40 minutes ago so i don't want to have the gummies now but i will make another review up on these and let you guys know what i think it comes with 50 of them and they're little gummy bears but they are full spectrum which is nice and yeah guys and i forgot to mention with these it has cbd cbg and thc so it is a full spectrum in that sense now it doesn't have all those miners like cbn cbc um what's really testing high on there is the cvg in the cbd and the delta 9 thc so definitely give these guys a try man you're going to love it liberty brand hemp thank you so much guys take care", "IoInXZTovgM": "a Kenosha County man accused of running a large-scale marijuana operation out of his home authorities claimed 20 year-old Tyler Huff Heinz

DEA and local authorities raided this condo in Bristol where they say they seized nearly 200 pounds of marijuana just pounding on the door is pounding shelly de bello woke up to noise and chaos right next door to her condo last Thursday morning I just looked outside and eventually Kenosha County pulled up several days later she's learning it was for a raid of a large scale marijuana operation that she had no clue existed doesn't even seem possible actually because we didn't I didn't see any of that but maybe it's the position where I am but I didn't see people in and out of there Kenosha County

what it looks like we're gonna see what it's made of we're gonna bring back up top we're gonna load it up with some club concentrates Alabama liquid snake we're gonna see how it hits that being said let's take to the mat all right well here it is the Tantra of eight products nirvana ultimate wax pen when you open the box you should get a couple of stickers with that they like their advertising and there's a warning on it this product is a heavy hitter well at least they're not making big claims right off the bat we got triple titanium quartz coil right there pure titanium delivers pure taste is a 1400 milliamp hour battery Tantra babe was a little glass piece there alright on the side here we got pull the magnetic cover off place the wax on the coil quickly push it five times hold the button to eat and then heat and inhale okay the other side we got some contents of the package with the bottom we got Tantra vape on the top we got Tantra vape on the front we got this and on the back we got some information here we have the adjustable air flow we got a dad jar on the bottom there's a visible vapor through the glass this is the rainbow edition right here and this is an exploded view it's a dab jar the cap for a jar the battery the power button the adjustable airflow system the triple titanium quartz coil the atomizer tube the glass for the vapor view of the top cap and the drip tip alright let's open this thing up alright there we go and all right when you open the package you're going to be presented with a ribbon USB cord for charging the device and here is the device tantra vape rainbow the Nirvana alright well as you can see this thing is ready to attract some fingerprints whenever you're ready to give it to it so this is the drip tip right here comes right off and that can be switched out for this drip tip right here alright very sexy very nice alright this cap does come off and there you have much like advertised very well wrapped quartz coils you see those this titanium wrapped around quartz tubes for even dispersing of heat Tantra vape all right here is the adjustable air flow it is very nice very smooth all the way closed all the way open what you see on one side you get on the other magnetic alright ok so here's some directions pull it up place the wax here you go alright good stuff charging charging red button means you got low voltage blue button means got medium voltage white is high voltage this is not a variable voltage device this simply puts out full power from this battery which should be about four two two four seven something like that and that's about it so five times on one two three four five all right there you go we will put the stock drip tip on there already well there you have it that is the Tantra vape nirvana let's take this back up top put some wax in it tell you how it hits alright we are back face to face with the nirvana from Tantra of eight products this is a advertise as a very heavy hitting THC wax concentrate vaporization device this right here it has a couple of limitations we're gonna we're gonna load it up see how she is we're going to be utilizing some club concentrates Alabama liquid snake he goes very well with helicopter sounds in the background so that is a bonus those of you who are not big fans of helicopters join the club here we go this is a very decent sized AB that I'm loading in this I'm going to centrally locate it over those three coils hit the button here see what kind of melting action we have melts down pretty good and I'll sound pretty good definitely covers those coils adequately well I'm looking forward to this that melted down on those coils very nice one thing I do say about this in a positive way is due to the distance these coils are from each other they're close enough that the concentrate webs across the gap allowing you to place to hang out while it's being vaporized without falling into the dish farther and going out of reach very nice room put the lid on here we're going to close the airflow off all the way just to see what kind of apron production we're getting and we're gonna give it a hit Cheers not too bad huh decent hit decent hit not a whole lot of neighbor production but I don't think it uh it doesn't get real hot so it doesn't it doesn't give you a whole lot of that burnt burnt feeling in the back your throat it's not it's not too shabby it doesn't work adequately well there is another model much like this from a different company that utilizes a ceramic disc coil system that hits a a little bit better than this one I'm going to uh put a little bit more on there just the air flow a little bit see if I can't get a little bit of a cloud going oh I don't know this may not be a specifically designed for uh for cloud production per se has a warning on it so where to see bow banging this thing hit pretty heavy once again it does melt down onto those coils very well and I do think this is a rather efficient device I think it is rather efficient um the magnet top magnets right down on there your spit back device is very handy completely unscrews for the cleaning of the glass and the rest of the unit very handy all in all the machines well done at the product well made it's just you're trying to utilize a battery to get a real real stationery dad experience Cheers it's not bad at all not bad at all I will definitely say if you are looking for a whack spin you don't like the oils you don't like cartridges you don't like tanks then this is definitely one of the ways to go I would recommend looking into this long before I looked into a small portable dab brake you know like the puffs go or something like that it's much more discreet much more versatile much more useful in my opinion that being said this is where you can pick this bad boy up and uh let me know how it goes if you have one of these let me know what you think about it and as always give it a thumbs up be sure to subscribe and like this and if you find anything else on my Jimmy like be sure you give that a like as well you have a good day that's McDonald seems you got azores peace", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if

unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "qvv7PvVPbqE": "alright guys we are back and we have a new review a new product and that product is vape meds line of cartridges co2 extracted oil right here this is Key Lime Pie one of the strains that I've really been really been dying to try so when I

one's a hybrid 70% indica 30% sativa some of the specs on the back here as you can see very very professional people what we have here 87% p8c tested all right and it is a half gram cartridge and it is a dis oolitic co2 extracted cannabis oil very very high quality let me go ahead and show you the cartridge itself very pretty pretty pretty golden cartridge golden oil and we're going to go ahead and take it out and we're going to give this bad boy a whirl my my cart maya my batteries are all charged up cars them yesterday when I picked up this thing I got the I'm gonna put this down for a second don't worry screwing in the cartridge while the point said my closet all right here we go we have it screwed on here nice and good I have it set on a three point eight is where I like mine set voltage wise and like I said we're going to go over again key lime pie is the strain bait met is the manufacturer Joey dad's is the one you want to hit up let's try it out oh yeah oh oh man oh that hit like a DAB Oh has that definitely that distillate co2 taste words where the flavors not strong but it rests in the back of your throat and it's like a sweet taste has a limey sweetness to it like a salary sweetness it's just very very good it's very good I was a good hit it's a very quality cartridge I would say hit wise I would give it a say man I want to give that like a nine point two nine point three maybe even yes yeah no you know what I'm going to say yeah nine point three we're going nine point three and cartridge wives very good it's a solid solid like like put together very nice

sort of a condition that doesn't allow you to move around but you still need your medication you can go ahead and get you can get that delivered to you really really awesome I guess it does have a good flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors like I saw Apple Jacks there was a lemon cake which is one I'm going to pick up for sure they also had like man I forget I forget all the other ones but they look really really good like really really good so like and I'm going to try

stay medicated have a good one", "KJcjYTArjIw": "hi guys under here from Essex UK UK thanks for joining us today we're will be looking at how to clean your vape pen just a quick short video just to show you how to clean various pens we'll be looking at a standard Eagle where you just replace the head normally and also a slightly more advanced vape pen with replaceable coils in in the in the middle just to show a few extra tips basically on how to prolong the life of your vape and the main reason for keeping them nice and clean and tidy and so oh yeah so you will need a few things to start with first being cotton buds or q-tips whatever you want to call them next paper towels pretty essential really and also what I would recommend is a nice bottle of of just warm water well that'll do you nicely I've come across this that came in and another ecig kit which works perfectly it's got a nice fine tip so you can spray with it and it's very squeezy so if you've got one of these that come in very handy if not just use one water straight out really tough so let's crack on okay so let's start with the the Eagle tea setup here so this is standard pen with the replaceable end with your wicks in so normally what you'd do is you'd smoke this with a any liquid in the recommend that you don't really change your liquids using the same cartridge I don't have that much of an issue with it as long as it's quite empty but there is another way so they start by taking a report intake can remove the battery for now put the battery to one side so what we can do on the the atomizer side of things you can take your you tip off so you would normally fill it straight up through there and I've got a bowl here I'll just use this too to keep the little bits and bobs in so that's as far as this one breaks down it doesn't break down any further than that so you would normally just replace this or have a few spares so what I find is if you take your warm water in a squeegee bottle like so and just squirt it down inside and put your finger on the end and give it a bit of a shake then just discard the rest in here and do that a few times try not to overfill I can get the stuff down the middle in fact what I'll do I'll put the end on it's probably a better way to do it and give it a good shake again you can see the wicks are starting to come nice and clear all of a sudden it really works well it's quite an effective way you know maybe you've come to the end of an e liquid and you have another one and you just want to quickly give it a nice clean it's perfect where to do it so you can see all the the residue coming out here I think you can't anyway there you go so that's pretty much it so what I would do now is take a paper towel and just give it a nice wipe down and then ideally what you want to do is kind of try and shake out as much of that water as possible because obviously the more water you've got in there when you fill it with a liquid it will dilute so you can check out as much as possible it's quite a bit coming out there when I'm shaken into the ball but it's now running clear you can see that the the wicks inside are fairly clear they're not yellowy color off the the yellow liquid that I had in there there's still a bit of water in there I wouldn't worry about that too much you might even be able to get a cotton bud in to some elements of that too to dry it out a little bit I'll just leave it with the top off and leave it for an hour or so and that'll dry out nicely before filling it back up with a liquid similarly with the the top the drip tip should give that a nice wipe down and around the o-ring seal make sure that's sealed nicely and then you can use a cotton bud if it fits and just clean out the inside of the drip tip as well just to get rid of all all the flavor and all the residue that can build up because obviously over time the more that you use these things the more that the liquid kind of breaks down and can stick to your apparatus so that's it let's pretend that's dry inside so that's now ready to go another tip would be to make sure that the bottom doesn't have sometimes you can get a bit of e-liquid seeping into this area so again it's quite simple just give it a wipe round the dry or very slightly wet damp cotton bud get into all the nooks and crannies and give it a nice wipe here because at the end of the day this is where the electrical connection heats up the wicks inside off the battery so you need to make sure that's always nice and clean and similarly on the battery end of the connector you sometimes see a little bit of residue down in here see if I got a bit closer for you so again just clean that out with a cotton bud you should do this maybe every few days or at least once a week just to prolong the life and it genuinely will prolong the life of year your lluvia pad okay so screw it back together now you've got a nice clean atomizer ready for the same a liquid more e-liquid whatever you want but that will that be good to go so I would recommend that you dry it out because obviously the water will swipe you don't leave you a liquid but all in all that's you know it's good to go so let's have a look at a slightly different this one is an Apollo brand it screws off the same has a very similar battery again probably make sense just to give you a battery connector a quick clean but actually did have quite a bit of any liquid in there so that's nice and clean now inside there's that to one side and then we have this which is their atomizer which has a coil inside so this one does break down fairly well so first of all we will take the coil section off the bottom and I place that to one side for now now see if there's any extra a liquid few drops not much in there so nice smell this one this is watermelon so again take you your bottle with your warm water in and squirt it down the side like you would with a liquid then again finger over the end give it a shake pour away the residue and I would do this a number of times just to to get as much of that a liquid out as you can again don't fill it to the top leave some room so when you shake it has a room to maneuver around the getting the nooks and crannies there we go so that's pretty much running clean again so two squirts two shakes and it seems all good again and I can see through the the clear window on the side that that is really well it doesn't smell at all now again take a cotton bud and just clean out all or as much as you can of the actual drip tip and the same inside as well around here and then in this case I can't get my cotton got very far down inside so what I can do is I can just take of a bit of kitchen roll of a paper towel roll it out at the end that fits nicely down inside now turn that round inside and I'll get the rest of the liquid that the the cotton bud couldn't reach go that's gone all the way through so that is now perfectly clean as good as new so the coil and this is a bit more messy like I said this has a replaceable coils so this coil screws out like so out of the base place the coil on the paper towel for now and I'll just take the the end I'll just squirt some water over it there's no extra parts in there just to remove all the liquid there I'll take another paper towel and just give this a clean get all the extra water off the main thing to remember here is everything's cleanable with water you've just got to try and get all the water off again once you've finished the cleaning process so that's all good I think what I'll do is I'll take a cotton bud and just wait round inside with a dry cotton board just to get that residual water out here we go it's there that's a clean base and a clean top now the coil the coil itself as you can see if I get a bit closer there there's not a great deal you can do with this you don't really want to get water onto the wicks as such I'm going to try and avoid that so what you can do is you can just wipe it around on the end to get as much of that yield liquid off as possible and any residual stuff on the end get that off and the other end and if you've been really picky what you can do is you can roll some more kitchen roll up and you can go all the way through the section and down the down the center but I don't see too much use for that and at the end of the day these are replaceable coils but what it means is when you when you have a VM with repairs or Kyle's it does make it a little easier to to take because you can take it apart and makes a lot easier to clean so there we go so let's put this back together so the coil goes in this section and the whole thing goes together like so and pop the battery back on so there you have it we have two perfectly clean as good as new there and ready to go so I hope that's helped yeah you clean everything pretty much the same as what I've just done with these two examples or via pens working pretty much the same manner and yes the same goes even with so bomb setups with with saban tanks you break them down as much as possible clean as much as you can with warm water and for the same reasons it's just to prolong the life if you vaporizer you know so you don't have to to to spend as much on on replaceable x' as as you might do", "9-kXhCNlApI": "okay he's real quick I want to talk about using my CBD vape pen to treat my anxiety now as you guys know anybody's watch this channel I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for quite a while most of my adult life really and I've tried a lot of different pharmaceuticals a lot of antidepressants that worked for a while but really the side effects were just so so bad they had to look for something else and I found CBD and that has helped immensely you go back and look at some of the videos on this channel I was a an absolute basket case you know going through a very bad breakup a bad relationship that was really I hate using the word toxic but it was and I was in a constant state of anxiety over what she was gonna do well you know what which you know which Jennifer was gonna show up today you know was she gonna break up with me all this stuff and it was it was driving me drive me crazy but it was it was put it take me to a space where I didn't want to be right and I thought that you know taking these antidepressants would help out but they really did so regardless CBD has helped me immensely deal with my anxiety deal with my depression and the reason I used the vape pen but most is because vaping CBD gets it into your system a lot quicker than the tincture I still have the teacher right I use that all I use this everyday as well but the majority of the the CBD I take is with a vape pen because you can't get to my system a lot quicker if I ever feel a little anxious or if frustrated or anything that that might trigger me into a an anxiety attack or or worse than my depression you know hit the alert the vape and I get you know like I say instant relief but within a few minutes I feel a lot better and yeah it's uh this thing goes with me everywhere I'm having the tincture with me today because I need the visual proper but this is my pocket or my backpack every single day and I use it throughout the day yeah maybe ten ten times a day probably you know again when I feel when I'm feeling that anxious mood when I'm a little sad and just kind of preventative too you know I'll just take a hit now then when I remember but yeah that's why I use the the babe penny the most because it gets in your system so much better so much quicker I should say and it's been gonna say a lifesaver but it has really changed things for me mentally and emotionally I'm a lot more stable than it was even a few months ago and that could be you know have something to do with you know really removing some of the stressors in my life and getting rid of some you know the people who have caused so much drama so those have helped too but the CBD has has really done wonders you know I'm not taking my antidepressants anymore there's been no side effects from the CBD right and I feel I feel better all around you know I feel healthier I feel calmer you know my confidence is returning slowly but but it's returning so yeah you've been again I use combination so if you want to try also I have this if you want to try a bottle of CBD for yourself the teacher there is a link in in the description below or a company that will send you a bottle like this free you just paste shipping handling it's I think $6.99 or 695 so 7 bucks for a trial bottle of CBD if you have anxiety or depression I strongly recommend trying CBD the tincture takes longer to work but from what I understand it permeates your your cells in your body deeper and longer than than the bait pen but the vape pen is quicker so that's why I carry it around this is more I said maintenance then than anything else so the tincture I'll take a dropper full which is 15 mil 15 milligrams 1 5 15 I'll take it three times a day one in the morning one in the afternoon and then one at night before I go to bed and again it has done wonders my anxiety and for my depression so I want to pick up a bottle link is in the description below you can probably find a CBD vape pen a cartridge say your local vape shop this one was $38 anything with tax the lower 38 bucks so 40 bucks or a card I've seen some of these for you know 1990 1995 or something like that and they seemed a little sketchy so this one really works but again CBD is kind of expensive so that's why having me the free trial is a good deal you know 7 bucks give it a shot and see what it does for your anxiety and for your pretty depression that's all I got I could share this video subscribe to the challenge time we doing a whole series of CBD related videos and how it's helped me with my anxiety depression specifically that's what I'm taking it anyway and I guess so I got and I will see you guys tomorrow", "x1SEo05vk5Q": "hello hello cannabis connoisseurs welcome back to the channel Kimo here with a brand new purchase just back from the store with this new paper cartridge

peppery earthy taste can find a lot of information online about the collab project it's at Eve is 0.5 like I don't know what strain it is which is a little annoying but whatever it is it's really good

information I tried to get some more from the review I couldn't find much but whatever it is it's really good it's really smooth it's not harsh it's got a good taste good amount of vapor production so

new at four the Seminole County school district is out with a strong warning for parents if your child shows up to school with a vape pen and it includes any amount of THC they could end up with a felony on their record new success Erich von Hankin joins us now live outside a middle school in Longwood and Eric you spoke with Altima police about the growing issue and Lisa this was eye-opening so e cigarettes were originally designed for adults to wean them off smoking off nicotine but more and more kids are getting a hold of these not just in high school but even in middle school parents if you don't know what these are going to explain I learned a thing or two about these today so this is a vape pen you've probably seen that but this seems to be the e-cigarette of choice that kids are getting ahold of and using more and more because it looks kind of like as you can see a USB Drive and you can also put th C in here that's the drug in marijuana and apparently more and more kids are doing that a felony conviction could ruin your child's life it could ruin their adult life corporal Evelyn Estevez of the Altamonte Springs Police Department says a felony conviction is serious and it's happening more and more to young people using e-cigarettes like this but filling them with THC that's the ingredient in marijuana that gets you high law enforcement is not going to have a choice what the law says is that that THC concentrate constitutes a third-degree felony does it matter the amount we're not it's not like the traditional flower marijuana that people are used to seeing Seminole County Schools put out that same warning on Friday in this letter emailed to parents district-wide it warns that a student caught with a vape pen or jewel filled with THC any amount of it neither the school nor the school resource officer or deputy has any other options or course of action but to charge a felony for this type of drug incident on a school campus that means possible expulsion and it's punishable by up to five years in prison five years of probation and a $5,000 fine when you talk about a felony I mean as an adult you know that when you fill out applications whether it be a college application an employment application they talk about these have you ever been charged with a felony so it's a pretty serious thing this is not something that you're just gonna deal with as a juvenile so why does this look like a USB Drive and why does it smell like in some cases roses really or some other fresh scent well police tell me it's absolutely intentional coming up when I see again at six o'clock tonight some really good information additional information for parents I'll see you then but for now in Longwood Eric Vaughn Hank in getting results news six Eric

favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask them down in the comments if you know anything about the channel then you know i try to take time out every single day it's actually part of my morning routine i drink my coffee and i go through the comments when i get in the bed i go through the comments and answer questions and just respond to people because yeah my people it is so salute to health wealth and self i like you", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs",

also this is what i got for myself this is a cbd vape pen this is a higher milligram dosage this was more money this was much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's

i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "x6rsrcKcaQ4": "this is our truly vaporizer pen it must be charged for at least one hour before use to do so through the USB

a look at the packaging this right here is what a perfect score for packaging looks like absolutely beautiful the only thing that i can possibly find that i would take away is i need that terpene profile and some genetics listed on the packaging on the presentation but when it comes to looking like absolutely incredible so uh the actual product uh again one gram napalm og live resin diamonds vape cart thc 73.94 percent um cbd 0.55 total cannabinoid 76.82 manufactured by goodwill llc manufactured july 23rd packaged july 23rd twist the cartridge onto a compatible 510 thread battery and draw

incredible and then you can just pull it out using this little cardboard piece here oh there we go i guess that's what it's for huh all right i'll set that right there check this out you guys [Music] napalm branded look at that little emoji right there the little flame that's super dope i love it i love it and then it's got the orange rubber pieces this cartridge is just beautiful the black tip look at that nice colored live resin inside of there check this out you guys get you guys some of that good color right there man all right so we've got a vessel battery we're going to use this here today a vessel five different heat settings this wood grip here beautiful stainless steel or metal i'm not sure how it is it's pretty simple though you just set this in there doesn't fit with the napalm cartridge cool thing about that is you can twist off the little accessory there we go and get it to fit this way simple twist on you don't want to over tighten it so as soon as it's secure done twisting push the button five two three four five and it turns on it blinks and then all you're gonna do is rip it you guys ready oh yeah okay here we go i'm gonna hit it right this time i wasn't sure if it was working so i really enjoy how heavy the cartridge is i think part of the part of what makes napalm different is their commitment to a truly premium luxury cannabis experience um you know the gentlemen that are running the show there are putting the time and energy into making sure that all the you know the eyes are dotted the t's are crossed in every single way the color on this live resin is just perfect and then you look at the actual little flame emoji here the flame branding combined with the packaging that's right here it's incredible i love the orange the sleek black look the uh the terpenes on this are fire this is why i wanted to be able to know what kind of terps i'm tasting in this when you talk about live resin you know you're going to get terp so i'm going to hit it twice give you guys a score on 10. while the flavor the flavor on this is incredible definitely not distill it you know with live resin and sauce pens on the market in california you never know if you're gonna get a true live resin product or something that's been blended with distillate or even just the sauce from all of that um what's what's cool is at the lower temperature i'm getting no burnt popcorn taste i'm getting nothing but earthy pine this sweet berry uh and i think what's cool about that is an og should be sweet and piney and earthy and there should be a pungentness to it and this is definitely roasting the nostrils not because it's hot i'm hitting it on the lowest setting here on this battery five heat settings i'm sure it's around two or two and a half volts or something along those lines but it's absolutely incredible when i think about the battery experience combined with the cartridge although i although it couldn't fit with this one i do feel that the luxuriousness of this cartridge of the the hardware definitely will overcome the fact that it may not fit on all the different devices and just looks sexy and sleek you know this is working even though i had to twist off this little section it's still working and so i think that's wonderful um score out of 10 presentation appeal taste color smell potency um what i recommend hell [ __ ] yeah um experience you know this this for me you know price point depending on the at the at the store this to me is probably a 9.5 out of 10. uh what gets me is going to be 0.25 on the genetics and 0.25 on the terpene testing again we want to know if it's 100 cannabis terpenes we want to know what the terpene profile is at least the you know two or three of the main flavors that we're getting and then the genetics is always helpful to understand the lineage and some more information overall i think this product is immaculate i think napalm cannabis company whether it's the grenade or these items or some other ones that are coming down the line they do a really spectacular drop of the branding so shout out to ted in exhibit putting this together 9.5 out of 10. absolutely incredible from

how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "dNHdi2X0Pwg": "oh it's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you determine which products at that fine-fine dispensary of yours are actually worth your money and what you should leave behind and today we are taking a look at another pseudo cartridge a cartridge review here on weeds but a very different kind of cartridge one that I've never experienced before and one that I'm very excited to share with you and today we are taking a look at doe cysts and their dos pen the Bliss model I guess you would call it so this is a much weirder project our product than we've seen before this is a cartridge and pen all in one is does not require an extra 510 battery the cartridge is built into the battery so the whole thing is designed to be disposable we've got this little pen here that says it's 50 doses meaning 50 inhalations and then you dispose the whole thing you don't have an extra battery that you have to worry about you just pick this up and you're good to go and presumably it's already charged and has enough battery to last all 50 doses um so let's take a look at the packaging first thing here really really a neat packaging I mean it's like this flat cardboard box and with a nice little lift tear here thing there to get the pen out it has a wonderful lots and lots of information on it tells you there THC and terpenes breakdown and CBD breakdown just really really cool packaging and cool information presented now you can see that this is a roughly equates to a half gram cartridge and it was 40 bucks so not a terrible price for something that has the battery built in in addition to having you know 50 doses as they say this is the Bliss flavored which I was told this basically like comes from their Jack Herer strain bliss by dosis as they say on the back combines the best of the plants uplifting cannabinoids and turkeys into one a targeted formula the DOS pen delivers a precise dose working with your endocannabinoid system to help you feel just the right amount of good the first complete solution in cannabis and then on the back also there are the directions on how to actually use this instructions for use for a single dose inhaled the pen until the in inhale until pen vibrates the doses suggest limiting intakes to three doses per hour okay let's go ahead and open it up see how easy this package is and get a couple hits off of it and then of course the way our cartridge reviews work is we give you the whole experience I'm going to take a couple of hits here let you know how it hits how it tastes all that good stuff and then I'll actually come back to you at the end after the cartridge is completely used up and giving my whole thoughts oh wow okay cool and on the back here you can even see after you open it up it gives you even more instructions that I really quite like it says useful tips for enjoying a moment of bliss a hum smile celebrate with a dance practice laughing enjoy it has recycling instructions it has tips for the right dosage and how to use the dose pen just a really bunch of really cool information and really interestingly designed package very nice and then it goes and you tear again to actually get into the pen which is right here it's just delivering health and happiness so let's pop this pen out maybe possibly there we go okay so how to use this dose pen inhale using the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is located at the end of the device directly above the reservoir window inhale at a normal rate and void avoid inhaling aggressively inhaling at a normal rate will deliver a two and a half to two to two point two five milligram dose stop inhaling when the pen vibrates and then it also suggests that being an experienced cannabis user I should do three doses an hour so I guess this is the window of your uh let's give it an inhalation oh wow excuse me and one more because I'm an experienced cannabis user what an intern what an interesting little pen it absolutely works it worked flawlessly actually I was doubtful that when I was first inhale I was like is this thing really gonna work what is this thing and then sure enough the vapor comes in and let's be very clear that was incredibly low that was tasted incredible love the way it tasted amazing and it hit so smooth and more my coughing that's on me not on them I'm just bad at it um but Wow I really really like the taste and I really really like how smoothly that hits on that little vibration feature so neat I'm going to not take their recommended dosage and go and do another one of these yeah and then that vibration when it hits is it perfectly encapsulated a little perfect dose I am really impressed with this as a package I'm feeling great right now um feeling uh pretty high as bad as high as I would want to feel from a pen so far this is a fun little package I like this quite a bit but I'm concerned it's going to end up being worth the money at 40 bucks I've done four out of my 50 doses already so almost 10% of the way through this little pen but in terms of like disposability in terms portability in terms of just grab and go and not to worry about batteries and charging this is a neat little product I I have I have an affinity for this site there's their instant this and there's definitely a market for something like this that has just grab and go open up this cartridge open this packaging in Europe you're set and you're ready to you know take this to the beach you're ready to take this on a cross-country trip you know it's really interesting need product I'm gonna do one more of these get 10% of the way through it and then guys I will come back to you in well however long it takes me to get through this whole thing which might only be a day or two if that and then I'll come back to you and give you all my wrap-up thoughts so thank you for watching weeks guys we will see you in just a bit peace hi guys I am back and I am here to talk about bliss gnosis dosed pen here we are a little zoom in or focus there so this little feminine-hygiene looking product here um I've got some real feelings about I got some real things to say about this little guy overall I would say my impression is quite positive I think I like this thing quite a bit in several ways I love how discreet it is I I like the technology that's packed into it it's it's it's really cool aids just grab and go you don't to worry about anything else you just open up the package and you've got this thing ready to go don't need a lighter don't need a battery you don't need anything you just take it inhale it and go it's wonderful but the thing that I am worried about is the value proposition I'm not sure that this is the product to go for if you are a heavy smoker or if you have a high tolerance I just don't think it's going to get you your best value this was 40 bucks I believe yeah I think it was $40 and I didn't count the actual number of doses it gave me the 3 second hits but it was somewhere right around 50 maybe a little more I'm not sure if it's calibrated to exactly 50 but that's it just wasn't quite enough in terms of value for me and compared to other cartridges I mean like the 3 second hits we hit pretty well they're they're not bad they're not you know it's not a bad product in terms of potency but just with that few number of draws and I like to take a longer than a 3 second draw it just wasn't perfect for me that being said I still like this I still think it's a cool package if you are a casual smoker if you want to get your mom and dad on to smoking something if you want to introduce you know weed to somebody if you're gonna do weed for the first time this this is perfect this is this is true I think a perfect invention for somebody who smokes very infrequently somebody smoking the first time it's just it's it's calibrated so well it's so simple and there's so little to it you know you don't even feel it when it when it when you do the little inhalation but now it's this little plastic deadweight a kid and he'll anything else I can't tell if it's actually you can't really tell there's a little tank there but you can't see if it's really out of juice but at this point assumedly this is just trash this is this bliss pen is just trash here um so ultimately I am gonna say I liked it and I do recommend it with as long as you fall under one of those categories you know you're an infrequent smoker you don't have very high tolerance you're just doing toothpick on occasion consider this for sure this is really neat and I like the taste of it a lot I like the potency of a lot it's just on the value proposition or for your your high tolerance or frequent smokers it's probably going to be too expensive and it's not gonna be enough of a draw for you but for everybody else give one of these a shot these are really impressive little pieces of technology I think again I'm almost just as much impressed with it as a piece of tech as I am a thing to get high with so um I had some complicated feelings about this one but ultimately positive I can't wait to see what else comes out what kind of new products what other people are gonna do with weed I think this is probably just the start of a lot of exciting cool experiments just like this pen with dosis and who knows some of them might knock our socks off in the future well guys that is gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always thank you so much and we will see you guys on our next review peace", "iTGAmHipYL0": "[Music] filling and capping correctly will preserve integrity speed and

you [Music]", "AO00JRgsgTM": "hey guys I was looking online for some more information about the no not just the vape pens but the hempseed all and I found a little bit but I didn't find any videos and I didn't find a whole lot on the vape pens which are these here and they've got I just kind of wanted to go through with you what I have learned about the vape pens and I like to use the one that's got the wick right here which is the same one I understand for the e-cigarettes which I don't even smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes but I do like the vape pen with the hemp seed oil in it and there's a lot of information that I've got to share with you but I wanted to start off first showing you this little kit that I got there was other stuff that came in here I took them out but what I've got in here now - I got my charging cable I got my hemp seed oil itself and then I got the vape pen which all fits right in there little case and you zip it up the in sticks out so what but now it's curable you can carry it around but back to the V back to the pen the button up here you click it five times to turn it on one two three four and five okay when you hold it down when the blue is on that means it's working see it's smoking out of the sides right there okay but you don't have to turn it off because it's off when you're not pushing the button but that blue light needs to come on is showing you that the element a heating element is working through the blue light the heating element is working so you don't have to hit it five times again to turn it off and the main thing is to keep these wicks saturated with the awl and this is unrefined all hemp seed oil now adding all to your vape pen this is what I do I remove the little cover and this part here unscrews which opens up down in here now in the middle try to avoid not getting any in there because that's the airway what you do is open up your bottle and as you see I don't need to add any but get a few drops here and you just kind of lay this on the bottom half here and let's just go underneath the airway there and it'll go underneath and fills up this chamber here which in the wick pulls it up into the heating element area and then put this back home [Music] tighten it up not too tight but tight enough like I said once it's already on it turns itself off when you release that button you don't have to hit it five times each time it will it has memory and then hold the button down and it's heating up draw it deep into your lungs hold it for a minute - just like smoking a joint and then let it exhaust it you're releasing and you'll feel the change you'll feel a lot more relaxed rot away you know the type of business I'm in can have a lot of pressure to it so in the evenings I'll do three hits like that and that's all I need for a while this juice right here would last a while a week or so for me because I'm not on this pin all day long I just use it when I need to and then underneath here is where you use your charging device charge it up and the light I believe is red when it's charging and when it's fully charged it turns green right here I don't think I left anything out but if I did we put it in the comments if you want to see anything else like this let me know if you like it like it if you hit that bail you'll know when I'm putting up a new one [Music] and I got a little audio file I'm gonna share with you with some sliding pictures and it will give you a lot more background on a hip seed oil and here's what I got to share with you the internet studies shows unrefined hemp seed oil don't have any additives like propylene glycol or vegetable glycol which comes with a cigarette switch heated at high temperatures can turn into formaldehyde the body creates some formaldehyde anyhow humans produce about one point five ounces of formaldehyde a day as a normal part of our metabolism inhaled formaldehyde is rapidly metabolized and ultimately converted to carbon dioxide and exhale

today Dan in particular wants to be on this show we're about to bring Nick on the show dan was like I got a lot to say here so we got a bunch of options we want to show you some creative options Dan anything before we kick this off let's jump right into it I love it alright and good so take it away okay original a sliding box kit you've seen that at the trade shows some people go up to make the traitors like I would never use that that is so different from my branding yes we customized things it's not for you it's all about what you're about this is another one that is very popular it's our that was one of our first products that people really fell in love with they're like wow I see how this is different I see how this is better that's out there it's a nice texture paper on the bottom and a soft touch paper with a black hot stamp on the top all right they're board insert in this one let's keep it let's keep it rolling rapid fire because we get a lot to go through this is a less expensive option it's our blister fold or I don't have one that's open but this is one long piece and the blister pops in and you fold it tapes together and you can customize it any way you want we can use all of our foils spot UV any kind of coloration you want or a nice textured paper if you want to go that route less expensive way that you could still make very customizable and look great so it's going to say is you have adhesive on that so you don't need any heat sealing equipment and that's something that a lot of people have liked about that concept all right customizable blisters is another two piece box it just has a nice angle to it so it has the colorful feel there and inside we have an Eevee a foam insert which is a dense foam it's a soft touch of varnish on it as well that's just a wood pattern that we printed it still has that you know luxe natural look folding box but it's on a foil printed on foil board so it has a nice shimmer to it a little more bling a lot of people they're looking at the cosmetic market as what their cannabis brands are about and I think it's good but I want to make a point that I think people should still because a lot of people are thinking that way make sure you still maintain your unique angle so don't go cookie cutter try to think of how you're going to be separate from other people who are thinking in this cosmetic mindset a lot of people are using the vault box for their cartridges this one doesn't have an insert the vault box exclusive to contempo specialty packaging yes patent pending patent pending child resistant certified trademark trademark the two began which we shown in our pre-roll show pr\u00e9val show but also another option so the dates this is a non contempo product but we want to show it because it looks great we have a pattern on the outside which matches the products on the inside I think that would be awesome with the disposable pen where you match the pattern on the pen custom pen match the pattern to the box like the Kate Spade pen so sometimes you can get inspired from other industries and do the same thing and get the same advantages that those people did but this is another paper product through peaceful signing box the feedback has been and I quote outstanding on that box and the texture in the field this is not a contempo product but we think it looks really nice it's a textured paper on the bottom on the top and it's a very simple on folding box good job it's not super sturdy but it still looks really nice and they have a folding board insert inside really cool of that contrasting look so you can have you know one look where everything's really uniform everything's really clean or you can have really nice contrasting you can see the color contrast the craft versus the board and then you can see the embossing contrast that they've done here really really cool look and again they've done it well so you can go with either of those and I think they've done a nice job on that and the reveal of this icon as you open it is also a really nice touch yeah so bloom farms has outstanding branding outstanding packaging this is a good example of how you can make something as simple as a folding box and still be able to charge a premium price for it and compete in that premium market so this is a $70 product here so this is a reusable vape pen along with the charger so again really good job here and using some nice craft board materials dressing it up a bit with your branding the branding does in fact match the pen that was included in the Box done a good job I think of also matching this story that they're telling like we talked about the Instagram feeds the social media campaign that the provide they live and really having that match up with the packaging of the story they're telling in the stores good company good things and just a couple of different options that you can use to put the actual product in this is a vac form in here which is molded plastic that we would mold specifically around your product for a perfect fit and this is a board insert much like that Bloomfield box the board just folds in to create the cavity and then of course we have the EBA foam these are not see our boxes nor was the bloom farmer one so it states that demand CR on the primary packaging that's not going to work in many states the exit bag is still sufficient until a certain point in time that's been marked so just keep that in mind that we're well aware of all the CR laws and we're showing you options because it's currently available and once the primary packaging is required to be CR probably won't be seeing these things from us but the wallbox is still a perfect option solves all the problems all the world's problems are next looking sharp in that suit you're coming on the next episode of hope you know that oh yeah of course all right good all right anything else you guys want to add live studio audience Manny you gotta need to say guys thanks for watching see on the next episode", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "Ce9EVL8HO40": "hey everyone this is journey from CVD inside and today we're going to be discussing Debian's versus fate Ian's dead pins and baked beans are both convenient and effective ways of using CBD they are very similar but there are some key differences that you should know about so let's get into it baked beans often contain thinning agents so babies must maintain a consistency that allows the oil to sprint evenly over the heating element thinning agents are a common additive to achieve a liquid like oil CVD can be refined to achieve the needed consistency but this way is a lot more costly than anything agent so for this reason a lot of the time fitting agents are added they pins contain Flay the editors Soto beans eventually found in plants and that's what actually gives them the unique sense so researchers found that even when matching the original term he started him adding them from an external source does not provide the same benefit 7 times advertised as boosting the bacons effects can turn into really harmful chemicals when they vaporize and this is far from beneficial baby temperature so what disposable bedpans they cannot be adjusted and sometimes the high heat can actually cause the pan itself to burn and Lee rechargeable wet new batteries often have a temperature adjustment button to get the perfect temperature for each drop their pins usually offer the highest degree of temperature control so some people prefer a hot emulation and others like to use an extra low-temperature death so they can preserve as much flavor as possible even if that results in less paper their pins are very discreet so they Dean's are used for a number of substances and a lot of the times they're indistinguishable from nicotine band-aids and for that reason they pens allow you to use your product on the go discreetly and the level of privacy vape pens are the most portable so disposable bag pens are the most portable option for consuming CBD oil but there are no secret charges or pots to carry around and there's also a very little chance of the oil leaking another great thing about disposable late hands and rechargeable bed pans is they'll easily fit into your pocket or your bag dad Pennzoil we usually have several pots and they will need frequent charging Deb hands have a learning curve deaf hands can't take some practice because it is a multi-step process first you have to transfer the CBD concentrate from its container and to either the pan or heating element and then you have to time the vaporization with your insulation and on the other hand vape pens on they have one step you just have to breathe in however the simple choice isn't always the better choice given CBD connoisseurs often prefer the dabbing experience defconn's are the best value but at what price so Debian's definitely provide the best value if you plan to do a lot of baking the device can be used to be a concentrate and it can be recharged indefinitely and buying CBD concentrates individually or in bulk also saves you money that you I bet cartridges or disposable pans with that being said dad pins can't have multiple parts that can be a little complicated to take on let go and they will cost more money up front ma pian is a fraction of the cost and it can last for weeks if you're an occasional user okay so to put it simply if you're new to see mini vaping start with a simple single use statement however please be extremely careful that it's very high quality especially since the recent news of the contaminants and sunbae products so as you become more familiar with the process you might decide that baby pants are the best option for you or you might even want to invest in a dev setup thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you on the next video", "Ic1ELSLcQ8o": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "le8Pgcb0uaM": "Roja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel cannabis connoisseurs I hope you're all taken care yourselves and each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave me a comment read them all reply to them all like to hear what you say have you got any questions comments concerns I

"_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "gla2-EXesp4": "[Music] I'm going to teach you guys some ways to make your cards last a lot longer than they probably do right you can thank me when you see the results so step number one do not leave it out in the Sun if it's hot outside you know and leave it in your car something it's gonna eat back three you know it's gonna get so hot that it just disappears like for example have mine in my car and I came back and it was like nine it was like I was like what number two do not cheat on what people do is they keep on hating it and then and it goes down because you're constantly getting it hot and hot so the best thing for you to do is like take like to relax third tip if you are like public or like thank your friends or something there's a lot of people there yeah like you have used to / secret this is what I do and nobody knows but number four would be like can I leave it on the side like that well I guess I would I'm gonna teach you guys a little trick if you guys are still watching if you guys leave it on its side people say don't do this because you get stuck on the top [Music] another okay the fifth tip basically be to not overheat it like don't hold the button for so long so many people are like oh hold the book and hold the button for so long I like a make it a competition with each other and be like oh I hate about you oh I hate next to you it's like and then they wonder why they're continent turns blight or like or starts tasting right or it doesn't taste like the actual thing that's why it's because you are like you are heating it up for so long and the small little amount of cotton that's in there only have so much juice in the other time so it's like once you burn the juice in there it's just burning the cotton now this is an act I'm just so in the liquid a lot okay but um yeah so if you just take none hit two in wait let it at least for five seconds your penis like just let it soak in a tiny bit and then editing it it's like for me like I'm being honest like a car will last me like like a fool one last game like holy using all the tips tonight that's Michael eat a half part one last for like three to four days oh yeah here's another thing ready if you leave a cart like laying down or like just leave it alone for a long period of time it's simile it's gonna leak because you have it like lying down and then it's kind of just gonna overcome that's what happening I don't know happen to you guys but if it has then use the part like that and they're not meant to last you through and that's like that's probably all the tips I have for you", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "420nTyOkEI4": "okay so i have watched about a million videos on how to fix the cartridges for these style cartridges that uh people use right okay so most of them tell me most of the videos that i've watched told me just to take my fingernail or some tweezers and pull that little thing this thing here up because maybe this connection after use isn't touching the connection in my battery right okay okay so i did that like a million times i pulled that thing up over and over again put it in nothing worked the lights just kept blinking telling me that something was wrong right so a while back i had taken this cartridge off of my old battery and this whole thing slipped out okay so i just put it back in put it back in put it back in thought that what did i do i broke it i broke it i broke it well if you can see it's got a little light in here inside right there you can kind of see the wire okay that's in there now on this part that came out it has a little hole that goes straight through it and i thought maybe that wire is supposed to go through those holes i'm going to do this as a tool because it's kind of meticulous so if you have tweezers or something i would suggest you do the same and also be very gentle because you don't want to break any of the parts right so i took the little wire and threaded it through that hole threaded it through the hole okay it doesn't like come out the other side or anything it just goes into that little hole and then you just kind of shove this back inside of it right of course i'm not pushing the buttons right okay so before when it was broken and not ripping the lights would blink telling me that something was wrong with my sorry anyhow telling me that something was wrong with my thing now the light well in the camera it blinks but in real life it's just solid smoke yay so if you have like me watched a million videos on what's wrong with my cartridge why won't my cartridge work it might not be this if this is fine okay it might not be you having to pull this thing out like all the other ones say it might just be the connection with the wire inside of here it's not there or this thing pulls out because it gets stuck to here which has happened to numerous cartridges of mine so i'm sure it's happened to other people right this part you take your cartridge off and this part is stuck to the inside right here okay then you stick it back on there and oh my god now my cartridge won't work well don't worry just take the whole little nubbin out thread it through that little wire in there shove it back on stick it onto your battery and try it again i hope that helps somebody out there like me who was not getting the answers that i was looking for um on youtube so i had to use my own noggin mixed with a couple of the hints from other videos and and bam good to go", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "oz_tz8_UqXI": "what's up honey fam those of you already know we got the best batteries in the game if you don't let me show you how it works every box comes with the Honeywell slapper and a micro USB charger cable last but not least our battery clerk today that I'm going to be settling with is our blue Raths CBD part and it is a hundred percent THC free screw on our cart and it fits obviously honey all the best but it can fit any other 510 thread cartridges the way to turn on this bad boy is five times on the button one two three four five and the way to turn it off is another five one two three four five right out of the box the battery will be about halfway charged so you can get right to baby let's take a hit nice oh wait there's more a battery has three power settings it should start off on the blue which is the middle setting if you click the button three times you will go to red the highest power setting for the biggest hit let's try the big hit whoo can another three we'll bring it down to white the lowest setting to give the most flavor what but personally I like to smoke it on blue if you want to go gnarly go red if you wanna have a good time go away so we'll go back to blue this guy has a preheat mode just two clicks as you see it bleakie the better will light up blue and white and heat the oil at the lowest time possible for 10 seconds and if you're sick of waiting click the button again and stop the reheat and then you get to Rivet us but not lease my favorite feature instead of having another adapter to lose and unscrewing a cartridge every time your battery dies we put the charge port on the bottom of the battery and if it's the standard microUSB port a big metal boom the best part is with the pass-through charging you can keep charging your battery while hitting it when the battery is charging the red light was this little circle at the bottom will light up and it will turn off when it's done being fully charged if you guys have any more questions feel free to leave them in comments below but just in case we have written directions for everything we just talked about on the back of each box stay up stay lifted and fam", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this

USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions

for you guys so check it out for this video it's not necessarily a weed product a cannabis product per se but it is definitely something that aids you in getting high what I'm talking about what we're going to be reviewing today is the silo here this is the silo and this is by sea sample okay this is a vape battery so you guys might have seen the other one of this that is a little bit wider it fits a little bit better in your palm kind of it's a little wider though and you kind of put it in there with a magnet and just hit it this is like the say the brother the older brother this is the silo battery for your bait cartridges okay guys now let's get into this and I'll just have to open this back up here in just a minute but this is it this is the battery it's very easy to fit as you guys can see in your hand you can palm that [ __ ] right there if you know what I mean so it fits very easy it's nice sleek I believe this is full on titanium all the way through which is very nice I mean especially vers those plastic ones because it this looks like it can take a drop okay so if I accidentally like oh [ __ ] you know drop it it looks like it's it's still gonna be functional it's not gonna break it looks pretty sturdy okay now it's got a normal charger there on the bottom with the normal USB and I believe that it does come with a charger so you open it up you're pulled ahead out we don't need that and then yeah so there's your charger right there get one and then there's the little magnets that gotta go on the bottom of your vape cartridge which I'll show you here in just a second so there's the box really cool box that's cool now this silo runs about thirty dollars retail okay so if you are trying to pick this up you can probably pick it up anywhere between 25 to say 35 dollars I picked this one up for 30 I've seen some places do it 35 and I've seen just very few like maybe one or two places do it at 25 so just all depends on where you go to get it okay now what I need to do I'm going to put this over here now what oh I almost dropped it that could have been a test I will drop it anyway so what I need to do here is as I get my cartridge here I have some starfighter cookies one gram distillate cartridge by buddy's big shout-out to buddies and it again normal 510 thread on the cartridge is a normal standard cartridge nothing fancy on the cartridge and these pop out just like you know like some [ __ ] Tylenol or some [ __ ] you know all right [Music] there we go now what you're going to do is you're going to screw this on the bottom of your vape cartridge just licked out fits there just like that screws on very easy super easy and then this it should be ready to go now what you're gonna do is just sit it down there now there's a magnet you guys see that I'm pulling on it there you go sits down in there now it shows you right through that little window that it's all in there everything should be functional now there's no button on this all you need to do is just wrong now I'm unsure I believe it's got like a 10 to 12 second draw on it don't quote me on that but I believe that's what the plaid tender said when I bought this so here we go we're trying out the silo let's get much love guys [Music] okay that was just like a pre hit hit you know what I mean that was just to make sure that this was working all right now here's the real hit pretty good pretty good I mean wow just like a normal battery but a lot easier to handle a lot easier like no bad or no button that's that's super awesome I know there's the other ones that have no button but the way this fits in your hand the way it's kind of just compact easy to slip in and out of your pocket looking when it does don't come at you you know like that is all awesome the fact it's titanium that's legit we're gonna do a palm here okay so I'm sure just out with the palm way here we go so just full of palm in this [ __ ] [Music] that's pretty good I like this I really do all right now it does come with two of these little coil things that go around the bottom of your vape cartridge okay these little metal screw deal things that go on the bottom now you get two of them which I guess that might you could say that that might be a setback about this product is that you only get two of them so if you're really high let's say your cartridges you've hit the last little bit out of your cartridge you're super high maybe you took some dabs maybe you smoked a blonde hit your cartridge you know what I mean pretty high throw it away like I don't need it anymore I could see that being maybe an issue forgetting about that we does make people forget sometimes so there is that so that'd probably be the only drawback I could see with this product I mean just keeping it a hundred percent real just keeping it honest you got to do the good plus the bad about every product it's not all sunshine and rainbows all the time but besides that I like that I like everything about this I like that you can do two because let's say you have like a indica cartridge let's say you have a sativa cartridge let's say during the day you like your steve-o's at nighttime when you're about to good bad indica this allows you to kind of switch up very easily without having to unscrew it screw back in and unscrew it screw back in on that you can just switch between the two cartridges it's really cool um if you go buy another battery so if you got somebody else that you know you're living with and you grab another battery that's even more so just saying and overall I like this I like this I believe they do come in different colors so if you're asking they I don't want blue but I do I think they do have different colors I think they got black gold and pink and again don't go down all those colors I believe that's what I remember seeing at the shop is those colors I know they have a pink but yeah overall I really like this again this is about a $30.00 battery and it keeps uh hold on let me where does our [ __ ] let's see how long the charges it's a silo battery it's got a warranty card on it which is really cool designed in California 500 mah okay okay so there's your warranty card on it keep that just in case it breaks because I tell you what want to keep this stuff even if you don't keep the box you want to keep this stuff just store it somewhere very easy to find because if there's an issue with this you need this to have them fix it or send you a new one okay so just throwing that out there [Music] okay now I'm just trying to find out if it'll tell me the exact how long the battery lasts because I feel like that's important information when your battery shopping you know how long your battery lasts right and it unfortunately doesn't tell me anywhere it doesn't say anywhere how long the damn battery lasts well then maybe okay so here's the colors black gray blue pink I was right I wait no I said gold not great so I switch those to gray not gold but I got all the other ones right so hot and yeah it just does not tell me it's just a silo battery that's all it says it doesn't tell me how long what the hour is on this how long is it going to last is it gonna last six hours eight hours is the whole day is it only gonna last a couple hours what I dunno I just pulled it out of the box so I do know it's probably not fully charged but another way I wish I had that information for you guys if I find out I will make sure to post that information in the comment section below on this video so you guys have that information because I feel like that's very important when you're doing a battery search when you're going to find and purchase a new battery you should know how long the battery's gonna last alright also to kind of add oh this does not have a temperature fluctuate or you cannot you know change the temps on this this is no way to change the tenon the temp is whatever that the battery is set at and again it does not tell me that information either anywhere in this so there is a little bit of a drawback to this product like I said before it's not all sunshine and rainbows but overall I still still stand by this product very easy to use very sleek sexy easy to Palm in your hand easy to hold easy to fit your pocket easy to pull out you know there's no button so if it's in your pocket it you know you don't have the chance of you know maybe your pockets rubbing up on it and holding your button down and starting to burn your smoke you know all that kind of stuff so that's really cool it's very easy draw it's like a 1012 second draw here let's max that out actually [Music] Wow actually think it's longer than that that's like a 15-second draw or some [ __ ] anyway so it's got a good draw to it overall I [ __ ] with the silo okay I [ __ ] with it okay all right so this has been the review and my honest opinion on the silo vape pen battery by C cell and this thing is pretty good i [ __ ] with it i [ __ ] with the heavy alright so check it out let me know your thoughts and opinions if you have this if your tried it maybe a friend has this whatever let me know your thoughts and opinions on this product right

to leave and today we're actually gonna be diving into a cbd dominant vape we've got the 20 to one ease cbd vape from sundial that we're going to be diving into today we've got that right here i can't wait to get into this and all the other goodies that are involved with the reviews today on the other side of this intro so i will see you guys over there when we've got the intro in and out and uh we'll be tapping into some information on this 20 to one cbd ease vape from sundial y'all cheers and i'll see you over there back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got ourselves a 20 to one cbd dominant vaporizer from sundial this is the only pure cbd cartridge on the market that i am aware of there may be other ones but i only know of this one right now so before we go into the actual information for this cartridge we're gonna dive into the information that's on the box so this came in with a thc total of 3.5 a cbd total of 70 percent nice and rich and high with that cb d on this cartridge it has a package date of the 20th of july 2020 and it came in right around that 49.99 plus tax so at 50 plus tax you guys is uh what the price of this 510 cartridge is going to be i do have the sundial cannabis website pulled up we're going to dive into that a little bit and cover this 20 to 1 vape information that they have there before we actually get into the urban scale and start smoking on it so the cbd 20 to 1 vape is a part of sundials ease series which is going to be primarily the cbd dominant strains so the cbd 20 to 1 is a natural cannabis extract high extract rich in cbd with a good concentration of cbg and cbc and only minimal thc this non-intoxicating vape is ideal for any time fitting into your cbd routine sundial vape produces sundial vape produce okay let's try that again sundial vape products are grown and extracted at the care of using co2 processing and packaged in a c cell glass ceramic cartridge that flows smoothly with every draw so you can get it in a 0.5 gram 510 cartridge which is what we've got screwed into the fireside battery here we've got a 510 car starter kit which is going to be the cartridge a power supply and a usb power charger then you get the all-in-one or disposable vape pen you guys so i'm really curious and excited to see how this vaporizer is gonna do um the missus tried it out last night one big thing i've noticed from last night to today is it looks like it's crystallized in this cartridge here and i might have just gotten one that's a little bit wonky but uh we'll we're gonna see if it functions i took one quick haul at the lowest temperature on the fire side you guys to see how it was the misses definitely really enjoyed trying it out last night so it's my turn to dive into it and really see what it has to offer so we're gonna start out with the fireside battery you guys after that we go to the g pen battery we throw in a little bit of glass to find the final taste to see if the water percolation changes any of the flavors that we experience then we talk about the high and the overall finally to wrap up the video we've got all of that we've got to dive into you guys but first we've got the urban scale intro before we actually get into the fun part the smokable part of this review i will see you guys on the other side when uh we're diving in with the fireside battery on this cartridge cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said we're diving into the fireside 20 to one cbd vape we're starting out with fireside battery so these containers at sundial puts their cartridges in are quite unique if you guys haven't seen the way these ones work you actually have to push that lid down and rotate it to line up right there before you can pop it off there we go come here line up and there you go pops off it just sits very deeply in there and i'm this type of packaging personally i would say is a little bit extravagant and excessive for what you're going to need but it isn't the worst one i've seen you guys now going into the cartridge we're going to dive in with the fiber side battery first and see what we get through here we're going to take a haul on the lowest temp medium and then the highest before we do the exact same thing with firestep battery then we bring it back to or the g pen battery you guys and we bring it back to the fire side we do it all over again but through the rigs so we've got a 16 holes on this no a dozen we're gonna be taking a dozen rips on this pen and maybe one extra at the end but uh the only way we're gonna find out how this cartridge does and uh overall experience is by tapping in and smoking you guys so let's tap in and start smoking this cartridge cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side of uh the lowest tampa rip we'll chat about it a little bit then we'll go to the medium and the high change you guys okay guys so it had a really light earthy kind of flavor it's nothing overwhelming it's not really it's actually reminding me quite a bit of the shish kabari the fireside cartridge you guys where it doesn't really have any strong overwhelming flavors or leaning towards one way or another with the strong overwhelming flavors but just kind of hit you with a really nice and light cannabis flavor that i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys let's take the next rip see if it continues along this way [Music] still really smooth really mild for its overall hit when you do haul off of it it is just honestly a really nice and light experience when you're smoking this it's not harsh by any means and it doesn't hit you with that heavy vapor lung that i found some of the other cartridges do but again it's just kind of hitting you with that generic cannabis flavor which personally i don't mind but i could see a lot of people looking for more that flavored kind of experience too where you get more that with the heavier thc stranger guys but we're uh gonna go ahead and take a rip of this at the highest level and see what experience we have to look forward there cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so i've got the fireside battery marked at a 7 out of 10 for the score it really wasn't overwhelming with its flavor or exciting or anything along those lines it was just kind of enjoyable and light and just that mild cannabis flavor there's nothing really special about this it's enjoyable and the cbd is definitely where i think this is going to be the beneficial factor of its where it doesn't have that heavy duty thc hit with it it's just the cbd and i think that's gonna be the winning point the flavor itself although enjoyable isn't really memorable or exciting in any way so that's why seven out of ten is the best i can do now through the fire side we've got the bigger ports on here so we're able to usually get a little bit of a heavier haul which typically helps with the flavor so i'm hopeful that we get a little bit more flavor and experience through this cartridge you guys but we will not know until we actually dive in and try it out let's start doing that right now cheers and i'll uh see you guys on the other side of the low temp through the g-pad again stage really smooth really easy to draw through definitely one of the smoothest carts i've had to draw for functionability of the the cartridge itself and how smooth the concentrate in and of itself is now we're going to bump up to the second temperature on the g pen you guys and see what it does through there before we finish it off in the high cheers again it's just staying that really light mild cannabis flavor that hints and leans towards one another but it doesn't like it it hints towards a sweeter canvas flavor but then it sits that on that earthy side hints towards a more earthy flavor but then it sits on the sweeter side like it's very mid-range non-memorable enjoyable but nothing really exciting you guys and even on the highest it just doesn't have the oomph that i'm looking for in the flavor to really get me excited and looking forward to it you guys i think i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10 still for the g pen just because there wasn't any different experience between the g pen and the fireside battery honestly it was just overall kind of a midline experience you guys and i although i enjoyed it i didn't although i enjoyed the smoke i didn't experience i didn't enjoy the experience that's the better way to go it's smooth it's nice to smoke on but it's just not exciting but we're gonna see if the glass helps out with that at all we're gonna take our way through all three of the rips starting with the lowest temp working our way up to the highest you guys and the way we do that is we preheat the last temp and we just quickly flash through three ribs so i will see you after we are done our three rips through the glass on this and then we'll uh be chatting about it before we move on over to the g pen you guys let's uh let's get going on this cheers almost running on the highest temp let's run on the lowest actually to start off choose you guys still incredibly smooth you guys and um but nothing really that exciting there's a little hint of mint on that one you guys interesting interesting that this is the first time i'm starting to get it but let's uh tap into the highest temp when it's preheated cheers all in all you guys not that bad not overly enjoyable not overly exciting but not that bad i'm uh impressed with the flavors that i'm getting off the cartridge for overall experience but they lack of like a memorable flavor is disappointing so it's enjoyable to smoke while you're smoking it but afterwards i think you guys will forget it quite quickly and it definitely seems more as a complimentary cart so it uh it would be great to smoke this and then start smoking something else that you have that stronger flavor stronger thc effect that you're looking for but if you just want the cbd this is definitely an interesting card and worthwhile checking out you guys i'm uh i'm enjoying it so far now we're gonna take our rips through the g pen before we move on over into the score for the taste from the glass and the high before we wrap it up with the overall yike guys but uh oh excuse me i'm getting ahead of myself let's dive into this cartridge combo with the rig see how it does y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of these three rips we will be pre-heating the last one like we normally do there's the pine starting to play a little bit of a factor what in the [ __ ] now we've got cart issues you guys and this one that's exactly why we had the crystallization in there is what's going to cause the issue on this cart you guys this whole cart has just solidified with the crystallization overnight what in the hell i thought we'd be able to get through this whole review you guys but we're not not getting anything through there let's preheat the water the hottest and see if that helps anything or is it that the batteries just dead we'll see we'll see [Music] okay that's all it is folks battery's dead cartridge still works um honestly i'm not that worried about diving into the other two um temperatures on here you guys i didn't get anything different from the g pen the first time i don't think i'm going to get anything different through this other two temps um the taste from a glass i i am going to bump it up to the eight just because that pine flavor started to play a factor and i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt i am going to give it the benefit of the doubt with that g pen to be experiencing a little bit more pine a little bit more flavor in that uh in that rig you guys but it wasn't overwhelming it wasn't really anything that memorable about it but that little bit of pine makes it enough to go i enjoyed it you guys and i like i look forward to smoking some more through the g pen more so than the fireside battery just because the extra large ports and the easier the mobility of the vapor through there but the amount of flavor that i did have just doesn't constitute anything higher than a weak eight out of ten for the fire side on the the glass and the g pen on the glass you guys that the little bit of pine flavor that i was getting through the glass is the only thing that really can justify that eight now going on with the high i am i'm not gonna give this a 10 but i will give it a nine it is extremely clear-headed extremely easy extremely relaxing just a nice clear-headed medicated type of smoke you guys if you're looking for something to just give you that little bit of emotional support and emotional pick-me-up very very worthwhile cartridge to look at for an all-day smoke um saying that you're not going to get the benefit of the thc in there so if you're looking for the pain relief or anything along those lines you're not going to have that benefit as big of a factor as it is through the cartridge however they've each got their use they've each got the purpose they've each got their intention now using the cbd in correlation with a heavier thc strain is something i personally really love to do i really do enjoy mixing my heavy cbd and my heavy thc i find the highs are a little bit more balanced it's a lot more encouraging uplifting that like very much more of the assisting versus the recreational dosing that i tend to experience with just pure thc strength um the pure cbd are gonna be that raw medical that that just assistance kind of smoking experience that i have and that's really the big difference between the two you guys is i find that the cbd is more medical more supportive the thc heavy thc is more recreational it does have its medical place for certain people myself i like a combination of cbd and thc to kind of alleviate all the uh all the stuff that i like and prefer to use cannabis for versus pharmaceuticals or anything else you guys but um for now we're quickly going to wrap up i'll be back when i add up the overall and uh let you guys know how this cartridge did 31 out of 40 it ended up doing for the cartridge which is surprisingly well it's not quite in that beautiful garbage i think it's only a point off but it it just lacked the intensity of the flavor that's really what brought it down if it had that pine experience and flavor throughout you guys i think it would have done well i really do i think it would have had eights throughout the flavor because that light pine flavor was enjoyable and hinting and just a nice and unexpected performance for a cartridge that i wasn't all in all expecting that much flavor really that well over performance from but it did well it definitely did a lot better than i was expecting you guys and i think it is worthwhile checking out if you like the cbd dominant content or the cbd dominant cannabis based product you guys um especially if you're looking at the vaporizers give it a shot i don't mind it myself but for the time being we're going to wrap the sucker up we're going to be diving into some oregon golden goat tomorrow you guys voted on it from canica you decided you want to see that strain so that's what we're going to be diving into tomorrow i'm really looking forward to seeing how that one does i haven't smoked that strain yet you guys so it'll be fun and when

because i'm enjoying making the the content let's wrap this one up cheers you guys i will be back later with some more content", "5i3k1qBtUZ4": "[Music] hey everyone dr. Shawn here I hope everyone is well and staying safe amid this whole Cove at nineteen pandemic hope everyone's doing their part practicing social distancing we're trying to flatten this curve and anyone who's using cannabis to just get them through these unsettling times or medicinally I hope you've got plenty of stock today I'm reviewing the Aurora drift vape cartridge and that's for the 510 thread system so this is a THC indica blend it retails for thirty four ninety five on the ontario canada store so a good price that's a lower on the lower end of price points for vape cartridges it has seventy six point nine two seventy s sorry let me correct that sixty seven point nine two seventy six point five percent THC so this is a strong two very strong THC level and there's zero to one percent CVD so negligible CBD in this one it's an indica dominant strain and the terpene profile includes Mersin pining and this one I have trouble pronouncing it's spelled GU a IOL GU al if anyone knows how to properly pronounce that please leave that in the comment section so my experience with this vape cartridge is first of all I like the price because it's relatively cheap the vape itself like the vape quality is smooth it's not harsh and flavor-wise you know nothing outstanding about the flavor it kind of just tastes like most of the other oils that you would find out there there's nothing you know specific I could pinpoint about the flavor of this one the effects come pretty soon after vaping and the effects are very one-dimensional like definitely doesn't have the full-body effect that I have experienced with the Zen Berry cartridge that I reviewed previously it's more just kind of a it's a little it's relaxing but it's very sort of stays in one place like it's really just in the head I don't really feel this throughout my body and it doesn't have like a very it doesn't pack a big punch it's kind of just in the background if that makes any sense so you know you're gonna get a little bit of a relaxing comma feck from this one but in terms of like a multi-dimensional type of effect you're really not going to get it from this this oil so that being said you know taking into consideration the price the experience the flavor I'm going to give this one a 5 out of 10 price is right you will get you know a bit of a relaxing response to this but it's in no way close to some of the other more encompassing oils that I've tried so that's the Aurora drift vape cartridge if you like these reviews please subscribe leave comments and I'll be back with another review shortly", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live

just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "MQBM7n-kD6A": "[Music] I'm gonna show people how to take your leftover cartridges you know that just got a little bit left in them and we are going to I've already started on this one this one was totally empty you know that's just just scraps and I refill it so we have a bunch of em no empty somewhat empties you know so we should be able to get about a half a cartridge you know I'm just gonna do one or two and you know so you guys get the gist of what we're doing but you always want to you know get something that can just prop up your cartridge so I'm just using a you know a trusty adjustable wrench and then you're gonna want to get something to hold the cartridge you're taking the fluid out of because these get very hot so I like to just use you know pair of pliers wire cutters you know don't don't grip them too tight because you don't want to ruin these threads but found these are the best you know they give you a nice and what I like to do is see how you can see that the bubbles on that side I like to get it so it's on the side that I'm pouring to so that it you know flows out easily and you don't want to get it too too hot or you'll burn off the the THC vapors so I got this little butane and I'm gonna just heat it up so it starts blowing and then ever so gently and before and we come on that bubble oh we miss that one so we got a few in I mean it's a trial and everything you're probably gonna lose some but as you can see we are filling up the cartridge alright let's do another one here take this one these come off fairly easy I unscrew when you are putting the top back on you want to make sure you find a tip that still has this little rubber o-ring still attached that's not all you know beat up or because if you don't you won't have a good seal when you go to try to put it back together so this one looks fairly good so I might try to keep this one intact plus it has a lot of residue on it so that's what we like so we'll set that over there for now and then we just same thing I'm gonna put the was a camera bubble edge towards where I'm pouring then you just heat it up till it starts to move get that glass like kind of make like a little channel of which way you want it to flow the band before I know a lot of people are part of the good would you just go buy a new one but waste not want not that's why I always say yeah I don't like to be wasteful so as you can see where we're starting to get there she's she's filling up a little bit so you know I'm gonna keep going with uh you know the rest uh you got a bunch of empty so we'll see what we get later on I hope you found this enjoy and again follow off maine state laws and enjoy", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "heYn3Q8lTIE": "hello my name is pero torres and i'm here to answer some of the questions i am often asked by our customers the first question tends to be why are combiners helpful in the deployment of 700 mahers so i would say combiners are useful for two main reasons the first reason is that 700 megahertz combiners enable a fast and cost effective rollout of the 700 megahertz band without having to change or replace the existing antenna especially in cases where the operator wants to maximize the utilization of already deployed single band 800 and 900 megahertz radius the second reason is that 700 megahertz combiners can be very useful in the deployment of lte 5g open run networks especially if these lte 5g open run networks have to coexist with 2g 3g legacy systems and equipment from two different run vendors is present in the same site the second question we are often asked is if 700 combiners are so useful what makes comscope solutions so special well if i have to pick two reasons why our tma and 700 combiner products are so popular and demanded in the market with presence in the majority of the tier one operators around the world i'd say that this is because of the breadth of our portfolio and our excellent rf performance in all our products and also our ability to customize our solutions for any networking scenario and the ability to reduce the cost the weight and the size of all our products for any customer the third question we are often asked is does comscope have a track record on 700 megahertz combiners and the answer is of course yes our 700 megahertz tma and filter products continue to be rolled out in many networks around the world in many of the early 700 tomorrow's 5d deployments in europe and other parts of the globe we continue to work ahead of spectrum options with our customers so that they have the right products on time for their seven hundred megahertz deployments and our team of 80 r d engineers uh continue to work on customized solutions for any spectrum situation a scenario for 700 800 900 megahertz and also for triple band and development tma products so if you want to know how to best deploy your 700 megahertz band in your network please reach out to comscope and we'll be more than happy to help you in that process and one of our consultants will work with you in the best possible solution thanks", "KurpY8TmkNE": "hi there welcome to select

here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and

watching peace", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth detailed reviews unboxings and feature comparisons on the individual items so I suggest

reddit family and if you came here from that make sure you guys leave a comment down below let's get into this [Music] yo yo what's good youtube this is two stone for you and today we're back with another 510 cartridge today we're going to be smoking on some fire og so yeah let's get into this review so this fire og 510 cartridge is by the brand hex go i picked this up on the ocs website for 3150 for a half gram of this shatter dislike whatever you want to call it and that's honestly not a bad price at all for this strain it's clocking in at 75 to 85 percent thc as you can see here our batch is 81 percent so that is actually relatively high the plant type is a hybrid you can pause the screen right here and read all the information you like this product is a co2 extraction but enough of that and let's actually get into the review when i did buy this actually i took off the duty stamp because i did intend on smoking it but then i was like wait wait wait let's make a video on this because uh you know i'm sure everyone wants to know what this cartridge is like so on the back here we have some really weird instructions on how to open it you have to put your two fingers in here like this apparently and slide this one up like that and then apparently you get your vape cartridge to come out and uh yeah holy they can even come out so there's our vape cartridge and this cardboard piece let's uh pop this out here i don't even know what i was saying there but we have those two rubber pieces here to protect the mouthpiece and the thread piece i kind of have it nice and zoomed up here right now but as you can see we have our thc logo and that nice blue hexo logo unfortunately there is nowhere on this cartridge that is saying there's fire og which is not a bad thing but i tend to mix up my cartridges a little bit when they're not labeled as you can see we have that nice golden distillate inside of this and i honestly can't wait to smoke on this and try it oh so i will say the stuff i was smoking on before was super sour diesel by daily special if you haven't seen that review i'll leave it in the description below and you can also check the video right here let's take this empty cartridge off let's put on this new bad boy all right so now we got our new cartridge on the pen you can see this one looks pretty cool compared to this one because we have a black tip and this one's like all clear and i've never seen one like this yet i'll bring it up a little closer so you guys can get a better look hopefully with a little close-up you're able to see what i was talking about and get a better look at everything inside the pen not that there's much to look at but you know what i'm talking about i guess the main part everyone wants to know is how does this smoke so make sure you go grab your pen you have your pipe your bong whatever you're smoking and let's try this today because we're about to give this a whip fire og by hexo let's go [Music] the smell from this fire og gives off that nice i don't even know how to describe it spicy aroma i don't i don't even know how to describe this one's like yeah it gives off that like spicy aroma like i don't know how to describe that smell and that taste is a classic fire og taste to fully review this cartridge i will definitely have to give this a 7 out of 10 not only for its price but for the flavor and the high that it gives off this fire og cartridge by hexo is definitely going to be up there on one of my top 10 favorite cartridges that i've ever tried this to me is definitely if you see

precise you see there's only 3.6 1% THC compared to 60.1% CBD opening the box the cartridge shows 18 to one so you don't mix this up with your high THC cartridges if you swap them out also try not to lose the cap if you'll be switching cartridges as it does prevent the oil from leaking out this cartridge will fit any 510 thread battery [Music] and it really is that simple this cartridge has a very easy draw it has no marijuana flavor just leaves a slightly sweet taste in my mouth now vaping is actually one of my favorite ways to medicate with CBD because it's fast-acting the effects normally come on in five to ten minutes and they generally last from one to two hours this eighteen to one ratio in particular is really good for helping with mood disorders for mood elevation for busting stress or because it's mildly anti-inflammatory for helping with pain to some extent as well you can pick up this cartridge or any others at hello and be calm thanks for watching catch you next time

man i [ __ ] love you all bro yeah", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "NOl3lkgTT-Y": "yo what is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "vYxJoQ5aX_o": "hi guys how are you um sorry that was i feel like that was very forward anyways hi how are you guys doing i have been through some stuff for the past five or six years and that's why i have not posted any content and i'm very sorry about that i don't want you guys to feel like you're left out or anything so without further ado here's the product that i'm reviewing i have it in the title obviously but this is called black tie cbd delta 8 thc vape pen so it has delta 8 thc and cbd in it when you look over and somebody drove past you and looked at you like what are you doing anyways uh this pen i've been using for about two weeks and i'm not going to do a live review because i already took some earlier but i am going to tell you guys the effects that i get and everything so the first time i ever took this it was with my dad and he wanted me to sit down and first of all this is a sativa dominant hybrid just you know but he wanted me to sit down and he wanted me to be couch ridden and on a chair because he thought that i would just be high and i was it's very psychoactive it gives you it gives you clear headedness headedness although and gives you the type of high that you feel on cbd but also you get some psychoactive effects of delta nine thc so it's both of them together working together as far as effects it has 47 percent delta 8 thc and 20 cbd so if you don't want to take delta 8 thc right off the bat all in full take it with something as in cbc cbn cbg or cbd all of those are really good for taking with any thc products because them working together gives you more benefits than if you were just to use delta eight or just one camera cannabinoid all cannabinoids work best together so let's get into how to use it this is the mouthpiece that's the liquid and you want to look for a more rosy liquid because you know that if it's clear i don't know if you know but you know now if it's clear it might have bleach in it not the bleach that you think clorox bleach but bleach that they put in vape pens look out for that you want to look out for tests that test lab tests that test for heavy metals how many times am i going to say test look for heavy metals solvents and less than point nine percent delta nine thc if you're in an illegal state a federally illegal state um for recreational use what else do i want to say about it so it's actually sixty dollars for this pen and it gives you a one milliliter cartridge that's what it's called one milliliter cartridge um i already said it has 47 percent delta 8 thc and 20 cbd okay so every time that you open the package they will give you a paper that says notice to law enforcement and it will give you a certificate of analysis so that's the lab test results that's something that you want to look out for and that you want to take with you if you're going to be traveling with this if you're not going to be traveling with this don't worry about it i only person let's discuss how i use it i normally use it as a very sensitive person to thc any thc i use it in moderation what i mean by that is i use it every evening for i take about two to three puff two to three second puffs so it's something that i have to i don't want to build a tolerance on because it's one more effective if you don't use it every single um second of the day and you want to you know not build a tolerance on it and it makes you feel even better after you start using it again so yeah do your research on that also this comes apart and you can put anything else in this battery you can just if it works i'm not sure if it's gonna work but this is just the battery you can get a cartridge without without the battery but i got one with the battery because you need a battery to use the cartridge so why not but yes you can either get it without or with if you have a battery that you want to just put this piece on so without further ado i am going to end this video right here because i am pretty confident that i said everything that i needed to say and that you guys at your discretion will go will go over the research online and not just go off of a youtube video i am trusting you for that also i wanted to say i am not promoting the sale of regulated goods by any means this is just for my experience purposes and i'm just sharing it with you guys it's for educational purposes only so i hope that you have a wonderful day i have more videos coming out for you i got four cbd oils or i got four oils i got one delta eight thc and cbn oil i got two cbd oils and then i got another cbd oil that is very very potent so i can't wait to tell you guys those brands and tell you um my review on using them and i'm going to do a live review on one of them because i think it'll be fun so if you haven't already subscribe like this video and if you're token keep talking keep vaping um keep just keep on toking bye guys", "0CIgYyCFgco": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test

cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "WVnhfdr6j_o": "okay everybody this is a instructional video I recently had a problem my cartridge it wasn't burning my hollow I couldn't figure out why and I went online for an instructional video and found all these things about the plate nothing fixed it so I just there's this section right here where the smoke comes up the back of it I'll show you what to do you just take top off grab like a zip tie they're flat they're long and skinny there's a groove right there if you take you see it's going inside you push this all the way down sometimes the oil likes it get clogged up in the side of right here in the cylinder so you just start poking around in it turn on your pin and I've already done mine so I don't need to you just jam it around there a little bit it will get clogged up and you it's perfectly safe and you turn it on while you're poking it and it will start to clear up the clogged oil that'll fix your issue for you and get you burning and smoking again alright that's my video

and we'll see you guys on the next video all right man peace", "JLvw59l_hZ8": "hi everybody unhealthy and I'm the director of operations at one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "ByDdoErGrs4": "so you see me rollin up a backwoods you see me roll up a Swisher

always needed a few times first see as you could see the smoke is coming out so go ahead and give it a few taps first and pull to actually make sure that your device is working then you could get to work what I like to do is hit it a few times then take my hand off of the battery button and then push it back on and get it going and get a good good cloud going or I could feel the pressure of a good smoke in my lungs and then I get a good hit and then I let it out so go ahead and check me out oh yeah oh yeah very very good very good the gold honey has a good flavor I feel like up 90 91 %

lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you want to see more videos like this subscribe and hit the like and

sean miravichy here and it's time for another cannabis product review today by popular request i'm reviewing the sativa dominant trailblazer spark torch this is a 510 cartridge for the 510 vape system it retails for 40.95 on the ontario cannabis store and that's for 0.5 grams of oil so you do get quite a bit of oil in this cartridge eight dollars 19 cents have to be precise for 0.1 grams which puts it right in the middle range of price point on your vape cartridges so as i mentioned it's a sativa dominant strain that they're using here it's 70.5 to 78 thc which makes it a very strong vape cartridge and i would agree with that very strong label it is quite strong in the description they list a lot of terpenes in this particular oil and they do make a point to say that it is terpene rich and i would agree with that and we'll get into the flavor in just a moment the licensed producer is organogram they have a few brands under their label one other brand that i've done a review for in the past is edison uh their cannabis is grown in new bra in moncton new brunswick and so they have a really sort of state-of-the-art facility there and uh it's quality tested and all that stuff this is how it comes from uh act i actually bought it at a local dispensary actually went to a new dispensary this time dutch love so shout out to dutch love they're located or the branch i went to was located on leslie street here in toronto really nice looking place it's like a hipster loft and very friendly service so this is how it looks so you have this familiar tab box system so let me open it up for you you got the two tabs here so you push those together and then you can kind of scoop out the inner package all right so there it is and take out your cartridge i had it upside down okay there's the cartridge so uh one thing to note here that's really cool is the see-through mouthpiece i don't know if you guys can see that that well but the mouthpiece here is completely it's like some sort of loose site i guess i don't know if that's the right term it's like a plastic a see-through plastic so i haven't seen one like that before so pretty cool they also have a ceramic atomizer which is a pretty high quality atomizer which makes for a good vape experience um so that's it about the cartridge here um pretty cool let's talk about flavor so uh with the flavor definitely picking up on uh hold on let me get this back in the box before i start flexing around with it okay so the flavor definitely prominent citrusy uh flavors going on a lot of those sort of citrusy terpenes coming forward which is pretty typical with your sativas so definitely detected those probably some limonene in there for sure and the vape quality wasn't harsh pretty smooth uh the experience so i could see why a lot of you guys like this particular cartridge however i wasn't a huge fan so to start with it is quite strong so it hits you in a very strong way after you know a few minutes after vaping it it's definitely got a euphoric feel to it um definitely feel like very uplifted and happy and giggly right off the bat but i did find so i use this for about a week because i want to with every cartridge i review i want to use it for about a week so that i get like an average of my total experience with it so i can give you a pretty good sense of of what it's like and each time that that feeling is pretty short-lived so within about it's it's over for me in about 30 to 45 minutes and then comes this sort of like burn out kind of phase for me where um it leaves you feeling pretty dopey uh pretty heavy but not sedating so it's not like you feel like you have to take a nap i just felt like kind of you know like high really high uh really dopey so i could see how that's um you know attractive or or good first for some of you guys but when i'm choosing a sativa i really uh i'm choosing a sativas to be productive uh i want something that's going to kind of wake me up get me going making me feel good so i can like get to work do things during the daytime i didn't feel that way really with this one i was kind of out of it it took me a long time to like get thoughts through but if you're just like kind of relaxing and hanging out going for walks outside i could see this being a pretty good sativa choice for you a mild body effect with this one it was mostly a heady experience a slight body effect uh and you guys know if you watch my reviews i like a body effect but you know i don't typically find uh too much of a body effect with the sativas that's more of an indica thing for me uh so there was a mild body effect with that one and um that's about it for this uh for the trailblazer i don't want to go on and on and ramble i think i've got all the uh really important points forward the one last thing that i found with this one which is kind of a question mark if you look at the ingredients it says uh it has a flavoring agent in it and i'm not sure if that's just the terpenes i i kind of think it's just the terpenes they're talking about so those would be natural but if there is like artificial flavoring agents in it that don't want any of those so if you guys know for sure definitely leave it in the comments and tell me what you thought what do you think about the trailblazer 510 cartridge i would be really interested to know your thoughts so leave me comments leave me questions and please subscribe as always i really find your comments amazing and i try to look at all of them as much as possible and the subscriptions really help me out keep me motivated to keep reviewing stuff for you guys so uh lastly the rating i'm going to give this one a strong 7 out of 10. it's a it's a good cartridge it's just not my cup of tea but i could see why some of you guys like it all right that's it for now i'll be back with another review for you shortly", "ShtXtVA7zRM": "this is the true leaved Mystica vaporizer this comes with a USB charger as

cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "-d-7MVYz7Fk": "hey what's up I'm Nick today we're checking out levels float VAP cartridge level is a very innovative and trusted brand based in San Francisco and their products are always pesticide solvent and additive free this strain is sob right Hindukush its indica dominant which tends to create a more calming high for most people this strain is high in THC testing at eighty seven point three percent meaning it is psychoactive you can see five other cannabinoids and small percentage traces I suggest checking out our articles on how oMG calm about the entourage effect to understand the benefits there's five hundred milligrams of cannabis oil in each cartridge let's open the box lots of childproofing to keep it safe you need to pinch the sides in and slide the tray out to get the cartridge let's set this on to any 510 battery so we can try mmm this strain definitely has a lemon flavor with skunky undertones I can feel a body high while also feeling uplifting cerebral effects float is really the perfect way to describe this thanks for watching you can get this now at lmd calm until next time [Music]", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made

video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "7pdgC2TnHfk": "[Music] today I'll be reviewing and comparing the tax era and the cz against each other to show you the differences the pros and cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if you want to see more cannabis related content like this stay subscribe to see my newest videos like the next one we'll be showing you how to refill these pods with your own concentrates or follow me on social media if you enjoyed the review please leave a like thanks for watching", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so

but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're

blessed day and these guys", "hxxVrOv-v1I": "stop buying fake vape carts off the street because you know what you are smoking chemicals and i'm going to show you the chemicals you're smoking and it's not going to be nice you're going to feel disgusted and unfortunately that's what people do when they live in illegal states where marijuana is not legal but i'm going to give you a solution so if you live in a state where marijuana and thc vapes are not legal i'm going to show you how you can get it anywhere in the country online shipped right to your door but anyways my name's chris i'm with cbd and thc extract.co and i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and by the way if you haven't tried our hemp flour yet hit the link in the description below and you can get an eighth of our flour completely for free doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link below to claim the offer but anyways if you've been on the street you know that these glow carts and supreme cards and all these different carts are all over the place and even in illinois where weed is legal people are buying these illegal street brands literally because it's cheaper than the dispensary that's kind of sad but unfortunately there's a lot of price gouging in illinois but anyways i digress these carts actually have lead and ethyl acetate in them specifically glow carts so if you look at the lab test i'm going to pop it up on the screen right now what you're going to see in these lab tests is that there's trace amounts of lead probably in the hardware itself right heavy metals and you can see that there's ethyl acetate as well who knows if they're using it as a cutting agent or maybe it's part of the hardware as well but ethyl acetate is basically a derivative of glue um yeah you don't want to be smoking glue i mean do you want to be vaping glue do you want to inhale heavy metals because i don't know if you remember the vape epidemic that went on and i think it was 2019 about last year and kids were getting sick from vape sucks that it was kids really they should have been adults but um supposedly the theory is is that these kids were smoking vape cartridges that were basically street carts right and these street carts what they had in them is the lead or heavy metals or cutting agents and specifically with the lead obviously is very toxic that's why they took it out the pencils in school now they use graphite um because it was literally kids were dying same thing with the vape ironically and basically they were vaping oil all the way down to the bottom of the cart and when they vaped it to the bottom of the cart they started to burn the wick and the heating element and when they burned that heating element not only were they burning the heating element but they were inhaling the toxic lead that was contained in that heating element and come on really do you want to save a couple bucks and inhale chemicals i mean do you want to end up like those kids in the hospital literally last year and even with covet going on i mean health is everyone's number one priority right now i think everyone's has that priority and here's the funny thing glow cart's the company they try to act all transparent like oh we got these uh little qr codes where you can verify it's real that doesn't mean anything because you can go to dhgate.com and buy the packaging and you could buy the empty carts by yourself for dirt cheap so and the thing is even if you get the real glow carts the real ones from glow carts whatever that is whatever that entity is it's it's funny because the lab test that they posted shows the lead and it shows the ethyl acetate in the product maybe they thought just because they have a lab test that it's okay and it's totally safe maybe they don't even know how to read a laptop and obviously no one else does because no one looks into the stuff they just see oh thc vape let me smoke that or let me vape that they don't really look into the details they don't think what kind of vape cartridge is it what kind of is it distillate oils they're cutting agents right what kind of turps are they using they don't look into any of this stuff they just see oh like that looks cool cool packaging bro it's cheaper than the dispensary or i can't get it anywhere else that's just really sad you don't want to end up in the hospital but anyways if you want a solution what i'm going to tell you is there's a new product that's out on the market it's taking the hemp market by storm it's pretty crazy it's called delta 8 thc and basically because of the 2018 farm bill that the president signed basically what it did is it legalized hemp derived compounds for example delta 8 thc can be derived from hemp so basically if you get thc and extracted from hemp now it's legal federally which means you can buy it online and you can get it shipped to your door so what you can do is you can go online right now and type in delta 8 thc cartridge and buy thc right now and the thing that's great about it is that if you're 18 that's fine because most dispensaries are 21 and up for hemp the federal law is that it's only 18. 18 plus watch out there but anyways it's only 18 plus and it's cheaper than the dispenser at least here in illinois the cartridges at the dispensary like 72 bucks for half a gram for a cart where a delta 8 cartridge online is you know anywhere from 50 60 bucks and it gets shipped to your door that's before discounts and whatnot so point is if you want to buy delta a thc and protect your health and stay away from the dirty street vendors that are putting cutting agents and chemicals in your products that you're inhaling into your lungs i'm going to leave a link down below where you can buy delta a thc a couple of vendors you can get your hands on it and try it out for yourself it's just like the delta nine only it's delta eight has a double bond instead of a single bond on a molecular level i'm not a chemist or anything but i know that much so i hope you enjoy that information about why you should never ever smoke vape carts off the street ever again because it's really just disgusting so if you like content like this leave a comment let me know what you think but thanks have a great day", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart

effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits

because out here it's row in Illinois guys you guys there's no gram cartridges you're only finding 1/2 gram like huge or they like maybe for a medical patient you can get a gram maybe but like for recreational which we are in Illinois you know understand you're getting a half grams your new phone and you're getting text it's like 25 point one percent tax yeah on top of that it's just like and depending if you're th see percentages 30 percent or higher that you get charged by the THC percentage for the tax seriously very expensive that's why we went to Michigan just so you know go enjoy it out there see what it's like compared to Illinois I'm getting the [ __ ] out of here y'all go do what you got to do and take care of yourself I love you all", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney walk yeah this should taste good taste like like the weed cosmic sativa

"mZYhjVY_v4M": "celina how do W babes cartridges and batteries work well we have two different types of batteries so I'm gonna start with the direct inhale and what you do is you take our cartridge which actually have an indica hybrid or sativa marking on them so IH RS which is great because you don't want to confuse your sativas with your and indica is correct yeah you don't want to grab your sativa when you're trying to go to sleep so you know that was a big request that we got so we just added that and it really helps people be able to differentiate so you want to be sure you know remove this little silicone cap on the end and the direct inhale batteries they come to in a package and they have a handy little USB charger and they are there goes right into your computer correct any USB charger will do or your computer yeah any USB plug so the direct inhale you just take it and it's got a 5-10 universal thread on it so you just screw it right on and then you take a drag so and it just works right from inhaling it just works right from inhaling exactly so you don't have to do anything and so when you're done with it or the battery runs out you go over and since there's two you have this you have your backup charging you just take that one off then you put the other one on the charger and you're ready to go that's great and how long does it take to charge about 30 minutes okay that's not too long yeah and then we have the push button battery which some people tend to prefer because it's a little bit of a bigger stronger battery and you get a little bit of a bigger hit from it okay and so what you do is same thing you just screw it on and you'll want to hit the button five times some people they'll just take it and screw it on and forget to hit the button and they'll think it's not working yeah so you want to make sure you hit the button five times and it'll link three times to let you know it's on and then you take a drag and the other cool thing about our cartridge our cartridges is that we have a central pole that we designed in order to help heat up the oil because the cannabis oil is much thicker than you know regular oils that you know these cartridges were originally designed for so interesting and so it doesn't heat it more thoroughly as you guys eat it more thoroughly and quickly okay so you get a nice big hit you don't have to keep warming it up and so when you're done with the push-button version do you have to turn it off you do you have to push up five times again to turn it off because you don't want it rolling around in your pocket each time you hit the button it'll make the battery you know have a little bit less of a charge yeah and to is the is the charging time exactly the same for push-button model as the direct inhale they're both about thirty minutes yeah it's pretty quick that's great well all good information thanks so much you", "ZTVsRqcnKVo": "[Music] all right what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back to another awesome medical cannabis channel and this one uh really early in the morning as you guys can tell by the look at his face i'm going to be reviewing a uh cartridge by cresco bho cartridge my first time ever doing vho bho is a butane hash oil it is a process of taking um the cannabinoids and thc out of the fire by using butane okay um i normally don't like to um you know smoke anything with chemicals like a butane what not but cresco come out with a couple butane bhl [ __ ] disposable pins so i picked up two just to try them you know what i mean um it's really the only thing i can i can smoke on the go so with that said of course we're gonna hit up the ryze one we're gonna get it in there is no uh there's no streams on these guys so i'll show you exactly what i see all right a second what i see right there sativa beach oh disposable pen 250 milligrams so it's a half of a half gram cart it's 25 bucks i mean you really can't beat it there's numbers all right let's get straight into this thing guys it's unopened as you can see all right let's get it bacon bake with a bho [ __ ] disposable pan that's it okay so number one you don't even see the oil in there which i guess that's pretty cool and you hit it from that end obviously [Music] cheers [Music] i didn't get a hit off that [Music] a little bit um they're really hard to hit number one really really hard to hit really hard draw let me try to take another pull here i mean the look of it the look of it's pretty pretty cool 250 cresco rise you know what i mean like that that's pretty dope but i don't like the fact that you cannot see your oil so you do not know what the [ __ ] you're getting do not like that i mean maybe if you take off the sticker you could see some oil but other than that i mean i don't know it has a nice little greenery uh earthy taste to it cheers there we go definitely has an earthy uh greenery taste to it other than that i mean i don't really have much to say about it but i'll be buying these again absolutely [ __ ] not are they good for on the go sure am i feeling a little buzzed not really maybe a tiny little one i guess it's good enough for what i got it for um but with that said i'm going to take a dab real quick because that's just yeah that i feel a buzz i'm not gonna lie i feel it a little bit for like awake and bake but um for two two three little hits like that i should i should be feeling a little more i guess i don't know like i said i've been taking a hell of a tolerance break so i should uh i should be feeling something you know what i mean some kind of some kind of like uppity bite so i'm just gonna go ahead and take off uh take a night here nice hit of this grim dog which i have been crushing this grim dog as you guys can see i have been crushing i moved my room around a little bit i got my refrigerator over here in this corner got a little bit more space in my room uh if my room looks a little different that's why my room my like room slash youtube studio i guess you guys can say [ __ ] dog here in my shatter thank you uh baby girl i appreciate it all right i got it all out let's get a nice uh cold start dab going on here all right i'm gonna do myself a nice little fatty because i gotta wake the wife up we gotta get ready to go this um i will say this about this this grim dog i know but from [ __ ] cresco to grim dog but uh it is it is more of like a pull and snap kind of consistency with this so-called chatter all right now but back to the disposable pin uh we'll be buying these again now do i have a little buzz a little buzz um my back feels a little loosened up but it's just it's not enough if you're a heavy dabber it's not enough to uh yeah it's not enough really to do the trick i mean you probably have to kill that thing in one [ __ ] sitting to get where you want to be at you know what i'm saying that's that's that's really all i'm saying guys i mean it's not bad it don't taste bad it's just i don't know maybe i needed it a couple more times but i don't want to because i got to save it for uh for on to go you know what i mean so with that said let's go ahead and get this nicely heated up real quick i want a fast seat because i don't have much time got two of them torches on this [ __ ] today [Music] five four three two one cheers boys that's the kind of hit i'm looking for a [ __ ] 4 30 in the morning y'all feel me i think i'm up earlier than john on this one i hit yeah so we'll not be buying the uh disposable vho pens unless it proves me wrong later on today all right so i hope you guys like this quick little fast review it's not the best for cresco but hey what are you going to do with a bho [ __ ] disposable [ __ ] 250 milligrams 25 bucks right i mean you can't beat it you know other than that um i mean i literally just altered the buzz that [ __ ] dab hit but it is what it is guys make sure y'all smash that like share subscribe i'm gonna go ahead and wake the wife up get this day started y'all have a blessed turkey [ __ ] day mama i love you peace out boys [Music] you", "NsWN1U6hSN0": "[Music] [Music] skills by redcan now all the cartridges look the same so i'm not going into a huge detail showing you when i opened it and things because all the cartridges look the same that's my only problem with the red can stuff is that there is no labeling on it for you to be able to tell the different cartridges apart they all look the same they all have the same logo the same thc sticker and that's it there's no identifying markers on it so if you have two different types it's very hard to tell the difference unless you actually put a mark on it so you can tell um there's no identifying marks on it so it's kind of frustrating that way now as far as use is concerned i do find it helps with the nausea it does improve my hunger it makes me more um hungry it improves my appetite it's good for that now the only thing that i have a struggle with is it kind of gives you this mellow feeling which makes it harder a little bit harder for me to work on which is why i enjoy the train wreck so much is because it gives me that uplifting feeling and i'm actually able to get work done it doesn't kind of mellow you out and makes you less productive i don't find this one is as positive or as influential as far as being able to still manage my symptoms and get work done this one is not as effective as the train wreck is but if you're stuck if because they still don't have any will i get another one of these yes i will because it does work it helps me it's just not as uplifting as i would like it to be i'd love to know your opinion on it so if you've tried the skittles by red can please drop me a line and let me know i found that it's not very very herbal as far as the flavor is concerned their website says it's supposed to be very herbal and tropical i don't get this that taste i get a very turpentiney um pine flavor to it it's very similar to the aspen and as far as feeling is concerned i would um say it's similar to the churchill by aphrya as far as feelings go it's still a good product i really like it to be so that being said like my channel follow me subscribe to my page let me know what you think let me know if you've tried this you", "oMshsLsw0UA": "make sure to subscribe because all this is coming up soon and if you like this you're not going to want to miss what's coming up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "60H-rAHWXWA": "yo what is going on everybody welcome back to another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they brought so much more diversity with these wax cartridges right here with the portable chargers definitely my favorite brand of the year 2020 all right guys so now that i told you my favorite battery of the year 2020 i want you guys to tell me what your favorite battery is right so i'm going to be replying to everybody down in the comments below guys if you enjoyed today's video do me one last favor smash the like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys i'm going to take one more hit for you guys i hope you guys i'm not really too

video review and this one is the distillate high-cbd and this is two to one and so this is the cartridge and I told you guys the other day I bought these unspecial from my dispensary and they this one and the other two that I bought come in 500 milligram just took off the cap for the top gonna take off they kept for the bottom and I'm just gonna screw it in so I've talked to you about this before about how to do it I just do mouth to lung which is I inhale it in my mouth I hold it hold the vapor in and then I inhale again and I push it down and then I just let it out so let's see and this should light up green to tell me that it is working I'm getting something okay I see this one is definitely a little bit stronger than the one that I had yesterday again this is the distillate high-cbd two to one yesterday well the previous video because it's not gonna be yesterday for you guys but the previous video it was ten to one so it's a little bit different again this is two to one I did two pools on the ten to one and it was incredibly mild I think on this one I'm going to do two because it is two to one so it is a lot stronger so I'm just gonna do two on this one and then later I'll let you guys know how it made me feel like I said this one is a little bit stronger than the one that I had yesterday it's spicy the other one yesterday was up was a very clean flavor but this one has some spice to it spicy and a little like green and just a head of like citrus seal just a little bit anyway I'm only gonna do two of these because I'm actually doing something different today because me and my husband are going out this is our anniversary I don't want to do a little bit too much and I'm not driving anyway but I just want to make sure that things were these are good all right guys all right I will come back later and let you guys know how it poppy or how it went all right right [Music]", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right

filled containers jamel na joins us now live from Largo and jamel what can people do to safeguard themselves this sounds dangerous well it is very dangerous because it's very unsuspecting police say you need to be careful who you buy your e-cigarette tanks from or unless you're going to a professional vape store now that's what has parents are very worried just house accessible something like this is when it comes to e-cigarettes everyone is vaping oh but be cautious drug dealers have found a way to lace them when you buy it off the streets you don't know what they're putting in it pinellas park police confiscated more than 150 e cigarette cartridges laced with marijuana oil sunday detectives say they discovered that along with several bags of weed when they pulled over Tony win on a traffic stop Cal Jarboe a vapor road says to the untrained eye it's not easy to see if a drug has been added nine times out of ten the average person's not gonna be able to tell when you buy it in the story you know that it's been distributed by a name known brand and it is by all means safer it's a growing concern for parents like sushi aki knowing kids can easily buy these on the streets i think any um thing that makes it easier for them like an e cigarette or a vapor cigarette i think maybe we shouldn't have those on the shelves mom Jenny Hardeen feels there should be more done to regulate e-cigarettes that people could be smoking poison and not even be aware of it generally speaking with you buy it from a reputable company you're pretty sure on the quality control but there's no quality controls on those and they can do bad things to him now the manager here also tells me that obviously you know parents what you need to look out for there's a very distinct smell when it comes to these laced up e cigarette tanks so that's very that's something to definitely look for and definitely check for the color be suspicious if it if it doesn't look like something you purchase

for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "4O1bMIAj3wE": "news interviews education we are tnm news news [Music] hey guys i'm christine slofani for tnm news and welcome to costa atlantica and punta cana dominican republic unfortunately i'm not here to report on the legalities for marijuana in the dr which by the way cannabis is not legal here but while i am here i did think to bring along my weed pen and this morning i placed it on the counter i turned my back for a second and it rolled off and broke and i'm heartbroken but it got me thinking about a few ways that you can salvage the oil in your wheat pen if you break yours of course breaking it accidentally is not the only reason a pen will malfunction sometimes when dealing with weed pens atomizers burn out from turning the temperature too high on a battery or sometimes the battery just won't hold the charge at the end of the day the majority of the vape cartridges are not made with the best quality batteries and technology so they're bound to break from time to time one of the best ways to remove oil from a vape cartridge is to take a small syringe similar to the ones they use to put the oil into the cartridge the mouthpiece on the majority of the standard pre-filled cartridges can be unscrewed once the mouthpiece is unscrewed you can then tip the tip of the syringe into the open cartridge from there it should be pretty easy to pull out all the oil next all you would have to do is just purchase an empty cartridge from a vape shop or online once you obtain that you can simply push the oil straight into the empty cartridge and you're good to go [Music] now if you don't have an empty cartridge to refill but you have a syringe full of oil well then it's time to do some dabs you can use any dab rig that you would normally use with the concentrates that you purchased from a dispensary just simply heat the nail or banger on your dab break let it cool and slowly push on the syringe until a drop of oil falls out and then inhale the smoke now if the oil seems to be too stable to push out of the syringe then try and heat the syringe so that the oil becomes more viscous but don't over heat or burn the syringe hot air from a blow dryer usually works best or you can even use hot water as long as there's a strong sealed cap on your syringe [Music] now the simplest way to salvage oil that you pulled out of a broken marijuana cartridge is to eat it that's right after you pulled the oil out of the cartridge you can actually eat it you can add it to any meal or drink to consume the concentrate since the distillate does not have thca there's no need to decarboxylate the marijuana as it's already ready to consume the moment you pull it out of the cartridge the other ingredients in vape cartridges are generally regarded as safe to consume by the fda so you're pretty much good to go and you can add the oil directly to any food or beverage risk-free another option for you is to simply put a small bit of oil on top of a regular marijuana flour bowl now you can use a pipe a bomb a bubbler or any other smoking device just put a few drops per bowl and that should enhance the flour you're smoking some people even like to put some drops of oil in blunt wraps or on joints um and it works like a charm and it makes the smoking experience just a little bit sweeter i think anyways now if you're thinking of using the oil to make your joint a super joint well then i recommend putting the oil on the outside of the joint after it's rolled then if you want to get really crazy and you happen to have some keep saved up in your grinder then you can actually roll the joint into the key basically making your own moon rock joint and lastly if the oil you have is thin and might have already been cut with polyethylene glycol or something similar it should work in an e-cig or an e-juice vaporizer and there you have it making the best out of a bad situation i hope this video helped you figure out a way to salvage the oil from your broken weed pen obviously you want to be as careful as possible with cannabis products because sometimes accidents happen but marijuana is expensive so don't waste it if you don't have to for more cannabis news visit us at tnmnnews.com don't forget to give us a follow

harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube it's your boy savvy ji back at it with another fire video for you so first of all I'd like to thank all this recent supporters I've been getting lately man if you're new here man go ahead and smash that subscribe button right now man what are you doing that we produce some of the most fired content out right now and nothing less man nothing less so getting straight into it man getting straight into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't you just get me every single time oh those double hits are finito you take a double hit you're out man so just like I'm gonna be out right now so I'm adding out the video here if you guys enjoyed the damn video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe it I won't check you guys on the next work", "2oV5p_OrW8c": "this video is designed to show you the proper technique and filling the o2 vape oil cartridge first step remove the mouthpiece there is a blue rubber stopper at the top remove that in the package inside the cartridge you will receive a rubber filling tip I've already placed a rubber filling tip on the syringe that has the oil inside and what you're going to do place the rubber filling tip inside gently squeeze the oil inside another technique that you can use if you need to get all the oil out of the filling tip is if you take your fingers and pinch the end will relieve all the oil out of the filling tip for you once you've done that you're going to take your little rubber piece replace it the reason we replace that and so the oil will not leak out at the top put the mouthpiece back on and the oil is ready to vape", "vbaXWabINVE": "you too what is your boys here and we have the gelato one gram cartridge from Alera choice x-l gelato strain round gets you a better shot choice X adds a lot

everybody this is frank with dime industries today i want to talk to you about an issue that we all have in the industry and that's fake products i want to show you some of the things to look out for and how to stay healthy while enjoying your dining here i have a real dime product and a counterfeit time product i'm gonna go over some of the packaging features that you guys need to look out for so you can stay safe you can see that the colors completely off on our actual product we have a high gloss high resolution finish on the counterfeit product is a low resolution no gloss on here the authentic product has gigu stamped at the very bottom of the actual packaging which is our manufacturing partner counterfeit products do not you will also notice that counterfeit products will not come with a validation sticker every single authentic dime product has a validation sticker that has an individual validation code that you can only validate at dimeindustries.com now i'm going to compare authentic hardware with counterfeit hardware and what you need to look out for let's take these out of the packaging [Music] now let's take the hardware out of the packaging the first thing you're going to notice is that authentic dime products will always prompt you to validate your product once you open it you're going to see information that leads you to the validation program that we have on our website the first thing you're going to notice is that the mouthpiece on the counterfeit product is much longer than the mouthpiece on our authentic dime product second of all there's no california symbol etched on the actual tank another point that you'll see is that the atomizer is much smaller than our no waste atomizer you'll see that the holes the collection holes are actually fully exposed in the counterfeit product and in our authentic dime product they'll always be recessed into the actual atomizer just make sure that you're able to collect all your oil and you smoked

vape pen to review this time we got the latest offering from Aurora this is from their brand Aurora drift so we've got THC sativa blend one disposable of a pen 0.15 grams literally the beta vape pen never view here for it this thing will go for about 3035 bucks you get total THC seven hundred and thirty five point six seven milligrams so that comes in at 73% the CBD content is 0.46 milligrams so 0.5% it's basically non-existent there's like no CBD in here it's a THC heavy sativa pen so let's check it out here kind of eager to see what Aurora has to accomplish here lately it seems like that company can't do anything right let's see how they do for the rapes so I'm gonna open this up so it looks a little bit like San rafeal just open pinch the sides and pull it out so there we have it that's all the packaging you got not just wasteful as others so it'll wasteful but there you go so we will take this and and take this out here so there you go it's actually kind of a nice little pen I like the black color which is nice see on there it says THC sativa you got the Aurora branding on there got this little mouthpiece condom we just take that right off and there you have it it's your standard disposable Big Ben oh you got your THC sticker on here really like the design of it actually it's got a nice little mat feel nice design so far so good let's not waste any time always jump in on so hmm not an explosion of flavor definitely some cannabis taste there almost a little fruity hmm I'm gonna have to investigate a little bit more let's just try here see that little a on the end I take it that probably lights up when I drag yeah you get a nice smooth drag not overly tasty but doesn't taste like crap either yeah terpenes I don't know a little bit of fruitiness in there kind of earthy fruity tapes go together nothing too memorable nothing you're gonna be writing home about but nothing you're gonna really complain about either vapors not too bad pretty good so yeah that's your pen therefore you gonna be back here I'm gonna go take a little bit of experimentation on this I'm gonna put it through its paces gonna see what we get you're gonna wrap up the review on the old THC sativa blend grower drift vape pen here don't have a lot of good things to say about this pen so let's just getting a pros and cons pros great design like the black design like the iam of the unit feels really great like that little glowing a you know it's really great really branded nice for aurora yeah the design is great don't like the fact that there's no way to see inside the tank to see how much yeah well enough to see what the oil looks like so it's really no way to know but other than that great design and thus ends my list of pros let's get into the cons cons value this is not a good value for you you know one buy this package is gonna run you a 30 35 bucks you're getting 0.15 grams and it's gonna last you like a day a couple days maybe if your moderate easier but not long and what are you gonna get out of those a day and a half well not much the effects I got on this thing we're minimal at best stiva blend 73 percent THC I was thinking I was gonna have a really strong cerebral energetic sativa high really didn't get anything didn't really feel lifted at all to be honest with you if anything I kind of felt a little bit of a headache later and it was really feeling burnt out so I don't know not the effects I'm looking for on a THC sativa pen as well like I said this thing lasted me about a day maybe 25 drags and it was dead already very bad value it's only 0.15 grams it's not gonna last you long anyways but I was expecting a little longer taste first first few drags there's a little bit of a fruity kind of spicy taste going on there it just evaporated quick like by 12 13th Drive it's getting like no flavor on this pretty much just sort of a kind of a harsh hot vapor flavor that's it just heat the vapor quality degraded as time went on with the thing and yeah this was just not a good disposable vape pen so you know flavor not great did not last like it wasn't that great in the first place and the flavor that was there just did not last like 10 drags and you're not tasting any flavor in here whatever terpenes they put in there did not last the value not there 0.15 grams is not going to last you a long time in the best of times but they seem to go really fast I've had some other ones that last longer than this not good value effects like I said the effects were not what I wanted to be not feeling what I was thinking didn't really get me lifted it didn't get me energized they can't expect that of a sativa same didn't really get me high kind of just gave me a headache and left me feeling a little run down and burn so not what I'm looking for in a disposable sativa vape pen so yeah Aurora had some high hopes for you like I said things have not been going too smooth for that company the last little while hoping these babes might turn things around for them they are an Alberta company you know I got to support them but I cannot recommend this product to anybody I do not recommend it to myself probably will not be buying it again sure hey maybe did I get a bum unit that was not good possibly am I gonna be running out to try another one to see probably not for quite a while so I recommend you do the same I would stay away from the Aurora drift disposable vape pens not too sure about their 510 threaded cartridges gonna try those in the future but this is a no-go for me so there you have it or a drift THC sativa blend disposable lakebed do not recommend so but any of you out there have you tried it what do you think leave me a comment just comment down below read them all reply to mom love to know what you think I like to know if you think I'm right if I'm wrong did you like it what did you like about it what didn't you like about it you know how it works let me comment so ok thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed the review hope you're all staying safe out there taking care of each other and until next time keep smoking", "Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me know crossing my fingers that is real since i live in south carolina and simply can't go to the store to buy one south carolina is that south carolina i don't know that's a my family don't look like that but they're also bought on the street most definitely fake like most wait so yours is fakes but you're still hitting it appears to be fake i can't bear 500 but it doesn't look like any friendly farms car ipad and the liquid is way too light for care resin plus 90 percent would be extremely high for pure aggressiveness face paint hopefully she's okay i live in south carolina and that part has a rod that's way too big to do this sorry we didn't lose yeah that [ __ ] damn man be careful [ __ ] you doing they doing family friendly farms like that now appears to be fake what do you think about buddha bear look at them i've seen a video about the boxes but these backfire will last me up to two weeks what the [ __ ] who the bear [ __ ] don't know i don't know this one took a picture of it on a door handle that's funny real or fake cookies watch full video dude like i said they sell fake cookies bags at smoke shops now like they encourage dealers street dealers now at stores storefronts that's just crazy be safe out there guys like you don't even have to order it from dhgate or whatever the [ __ ] anymore you can get it from your [ __ ] smoke shop [ __ ] bags i've seen alien alien labs or whatever i've seen all that [ __ ] i was like what the [ __ ] so are big chiefs really fake or are they real see that is that is the age-old question you know what i'm saying flat thoughts [Music] oh since you guys since it's the 10th um fake cartridge videos i'm going to show you something let me show you something [Music] all right put this over here we're going to end it right here but uh just hopefully you guys are subscribed because i will be unboxing these and doing videos for these but this is just a preview and obviously i don't need that much i will be taking some of them though but i might possibly be giving some away in the future uh but we got a pipe thing it's gonna be dope another battery oh wait this pipe is for uh cartridges and then this is another battery i think and i'm gonna see how that is you know what i'm saying make videos for all these so hopefully you're subscribed and i could possibly give one or two of these away because you know what i'm saying i can't but obviously i have to do a video on them first but possibly this one this two battery one just two cards your battery one this one seems like uh i don't have to clean much after using this end and then this one is an eight bowl pipe possibly gonna give this away to someone that i know personally because you know what i'm saying this is dope actually i might keep this because there's eight bowls in it just for the tenth video you know i decided to show you guys a little preview of what's to come these are you're not gonna see videos for on these probably in like a week or two plus because like i said i do have a lot of videos that are scheduled i do have plug and play videos that are coming out like i have a lot of videos coming out but it's a shame that i can only upload one per day to get the most reach out of possible but this one's a special day i'm gonna upload this uh on sunday but yeah hopefully you did enjoy this 10th one um possibly the last one of this series i do sorry i do have uh other videos to make of i mean other reaction videos to finish but uh you know i don't know if you guys really want it i might make one but uh you know 10 i feel like is enough hopefully you did enjoy it and i'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "VPNksumOtHI": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video before before this video starts I just wanna let you guys know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple

yeah", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "80q0vTpW83k": "hey there so today i wanted to show you a product that i got from the dispenser here um again i live in a state where there's legal cannabis please don't flag me for illegal content this is a legal product that i've bought here um sorry if that was annoying but i just always want to point this out i'm not buying these things from the black market this is from a dispensary down the road that is licensed and authorized to sell me this so that caveat this is one of my favorite products i have ever bought ever and i have tried many many products so this stands out to me i just wanted to show it to you it's called the good news friday vape i know i know the name is annoying and it almost turned me off like the name freya i was like uh this is that's annoying i don't know something about that word just like somewhat off-putting for me but i went ahead and bought this and the reason i bought it is that it was pretty potent um on the back here it shows the potency of how much thc is in it and this one has 79 thc so it packs a punch and i also like that it has 300 milligrams of oil in it which means roughly to me this is about a hundred three second inhales is how i think of it um roughly i know it's hard to know exactly but um it's a disposable pin and it's you know pre-filled so you don't have to do anything to it there's no buttons to press and i actually just love how cute it is i know that's silly but it says fryer all over it and when you hit the end the end will light up i don't know if you can see that but i wanted to highlight the flavor of this vape so this taste is unlike anything i've ever had it actually reminds me a lot of this really silly um hollister cologne that i or perfume that i used to have in junior high it's very girly it's it tastes like girl shampoo is the best way that i could describe it um a friend of mine bought this recently and i said that i was like don't you think it tastes like shampoo in a way but it's very like it smells and tastes like apple shampoo is the best way that i can describe it and it's very fruit forward and very light of a flavor like i don't get any of those heavy indica taste from it like og kush or something this is a very light uplifting taste and it's a um it's really not a strain itself fryer is most likely a bunch of different strains that they've all put together to kind of make this concoction here but however they did it is beautiful it's a very good vape i've really enjoyed using it and cresco really just hits it out of the park i feel like with their flavoring like i can tell that whatever flavoring they're using it's most likely cannabis derived just because it's so natural tasting i don't get any sort of like overpowering notes in it it's very very natural to the cannabis plant but i would highly recommend this it was 35 at my dispensary here in illinois and again it has 300 milligrams of cannabis oil but this one is so good and i applaud you cresco for making this and i'll definitely be buying it more and every time i use it i really just think of a nice weekend where i'm like biking or just outside it's a very very happy high it's a hybrid strain i believe so it's nice balanced mill of the road but just wanted to show you this vape if you're looking for something that's really tasty check this one out it's a friday vape from cresco all right hope you have a good day bye", "IVfQgHNRTQ4": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm just about to open my marley it's a balance cartridge because um i'm still waiting the way my prescriptions are working it's really weird um i'm still trying to get my penelope and i can't get that cartridge yet um because i'm still waiting for my um thing to be renewed because last time when i was able to order they didn't have any in at that time so it's just this huge big huffle so i've been using the balanced um or harmonized cartridge by soleil um it's also by afria i did an unboxing about that um a little while ago but um so yeah i managed to do this somehow i woke up i didn't i don't remember dropping it i didn't use it in the night i don't know how i managed to get it like that but that is what i managed to do to this poor little cartridge um so and um chum is now out of the balance cartridges of soleil so um i'm going to try this in the meantime it's we'll see how it goes i don't know i'm going to open it and find out i just opened up the marley cartridge balanced it's the marley balanced cbd um cartridge i don't know if you can kind of read that but it just says cbd on it no marley is um a product or under ownership of canika uh cannabis this is a canica based product but it's owned by it's a marley product i guess so this is what it looks like so we're going to try this balance cartridge out and hopefully it gives me similar relief um to the sole balance cartridge i'll give it a shot marley natural red 510 thread cartridge this is what it looks like in my 510 battery pack that's what it looks like and this has just kind of been a we'll see what happens because i'm struggling with getting things on my prescriptions right now so i've mostly only been using the vape cartridges um just because we're at home and are it's it's just easier for me to use them i find them really accessible i find them less messy i can i can use them when i need them and carry them with me i don't have to carry around a grinder and all sorts of other things they're just more accessible and easier for me so basically i use these out of convenience a lot of the time and um i also find that they're a little bit better on my throat i don't find them as harsh or as burning which is why i use cartridges more than i have been using dried lately now the whole struggle with this um is because of my spectrum prescription um i didn't i was not able to get the penelope on it which was what i was hoping to get because it's new and i really wanted it but because my prescription kind of ends like in the middle of the month when it renewed and then when i was actually able to get it they no longer had any in stock so i've been trying to find cbd based or like half and half's to use um in the meantime while i'm waiting to be able to get stuff off my prescription that are actually available when i have a room on my prescription to get them hence the issues with the cartridge and trying to um get something that works now i did find one that really worked it was the solei cartridge uh the balanced or harmonized i did do an unboxing of it but i didn't do an actual review of it yet um but they are awesome i really really like them um they are also an afria product now marley is a canika so this is a canika branded marley natural product um now i haven't had a lot of um canika's products before because mostly it's been the afria products that i've been using um with the good supply and the just my aphro cartridges on my prescriptions but most of the cartridges i find if they're not by tweed or um they're produced by aphria whereas this is a canika product now i was um reading and it says that it's it says it's all natural um and so our marley uh red cbd rich vape cartridge is filled with five grams of natural cannabis oil a custom blend formulated with both cbd distillate and winterized co2 thc oils i'm not sure what a co2 thc oil is but apparently it delivers approximately a one-to-one ratio cbd to thc now i've never heard that before and i've never seen that in the product descriptions before so i'm kind of interested to know how that works so if you know how winterized co2 thc um works i'd be really fascinated to know i'm gonna actually have to uh read up on that because i don't know i do like it though it's been working really great um so far so good it has um i think if i had to pick between the balance cartridge by soleil and this one i probably picked the balance just because i find it gives just a little bit more pain relief than this one does this one does give pain relief um i do help it find find that this one helps with nausea whereas the balance because it doesn't i don't find it helps with nausea or with my appetite this one i do find does increase my appetite and it does but not as much pain relief as i would like so it's an okay one would i get it again and as for a cbd yeah i'll get this one again because i think this is pretty close to a um similar effects that i get from my um aspen cartridges um as far as as feeling goes that's kind of similar on a prescription based as far as a wreck-based um similarity i can kind of go on um as far as the cbd um not as high of pain relief but it still is working it helps i am enjoying it and it's um doing what it needs to do so i would recommend it again although i think i like the balanced bisolate better but still a good product and i'm really interested to know what co2 um winterized thc is so uh i might do a video on that in the future who knows if i can find someone that can tell me something more about it that'd be really interesting and if you really like this video you find it these informational or informative and they help you or you just like watching me make a fool of myself or give recommendations as far as what i'm finding helpful now what i find helpful may not be helpful for someone else but it may be so that's why i'm sharing this information and so if you like it click subscribe follow along and i'll bring you more informational things i also want to just um say one more quick thing about this i didn't put it in and it's i know it's at the end of the video it's absolutely terrible with me but one thing i did find with this one that i'm not super happy about is it does give you fairly dry mouth i want to add that in just because i normally don't find it too big in a too big of an issue but whereas this one i find i'm like constantly drinking stuff just to keep moist just something [Music] [Applause] else", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the

comments below what you're smoking on and Cheers [Music] [Music] i'ma switch over to the Moxie cart now I like this Moxie cart for different reasons than I like the rock garden cart that's why I like to keep them both this Moxie cart has a pre heat setting and that's nice but I also like it because you could change the temperature on it and as nicely as a puck because you can choose what kind of hit you want you get that fat cloudy one or you could get that low really tasty hit so I'm gonna take I'm gonna take a couple rips off of this before I took the blink on the marquee I'm not gonna lie the package says high potency oil it is I'm pretty baked right now and I still got that dab blowed it up yeah me trying to tempt the beans I can't do it I just end up doing like a regular French inhale I'm gonna take a drink of water before I attempt at the next blinker make sure you always keep something on you that stay hydrated this car does have me bait disguise and I think blues the medium on the Moxie cart on the Moxie battery but I'm not too sure cuz I'm getting mixed up cuz I'm the puff Co blue is like the lowest alright here we go Cheers oh my god these Eureka cards smack but let me know if you think I should start streaming I got a webcam I had for my PC am I trying plug it into my ps4 and see if it would connect I'll be just like hitting my car taking that explain to Kay Martin warfare on the ps4 I think I am gonna end up taking that dab yeah I got a nice type of Girl Scout cookies in here yeah you know what let me get the camera I'll show you all right here we go imma hit on the green setting I mean you know what let's hit on the red which is the high setting but it's not the highest the higher setting is the white all right double click it there we go blinking is warming up just bud Cheers [Music] [Music] damn that punk and dab could go yeah like what I said I would I would recommend the Eureka cart I got the London poundcake I think that's in the cups I'm not mistaken but it does Mac and it's pretty potent cars I'm gonna do one more trick I think I did it towards the end and take that big of a movie I must open my window or something my room's ball I don't know it's weird but I will end up getting it all right if you enjoyed the video make sure you like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "F20EmG4W9Vk": "oh it's not above to make me change like a castaway you know you pay that you bought the cooler today hey guys I just shot this entire video and I wasn't even recording man so I'm stoned as heck right now having to rerecord this for you guys but it's alright that's alright so without further ado guys my name is Teddy G welcome back to my channel for today's video guys we got something crazy we got a freaking comparison all right guys from two of the biggest brands out on the market right now we are going to be testing out this dizzy live resin and we're going to be comparing it to the raw garden refined live resin alright guys the only reason we're doing this is because I felt like you know these are two of the biggest brands on the market right now in terms of cartridges so it would be just fun to just see what's that what what is the difference between these cartridges you know what is the taste difference what's the why is raw garden refined light resin and why's dizzy luck regular light resin and we're gonna touch base on every single detail as to what each company brings to the table and just so you guys know man who is the best live resin out there right now before this video starts though I want you guys who are watching this video right now let me know in the comments below spam that [ __ ] let me know what do you guys think is better we got this dizzy live resin or we got the raw garden and refined by resin so hey let me know if you guys have tried any of these and let me know what's your favorite and why alright guys so without further ado man I think the only thing there is to do now is to test these out get an ice and stone and let you give you guys the full rundown as to what I think is better alright guys so we are going to be testing out this one right here which is the key lime pie it is an indica and we are going to be compared - the banana slim from raw garden which is also indica the raw garden is sitting at 85 point 95 percent of THC and though it is e itself is the seitan at a nice seventy nine point seventy one percent THC all right guys so the difference is already you know seven to seven percent differential in the THC percentages is it really going to make a difference I feel like it all depends on the product itself man it all depends on the strain it depends on you know yeah I think it just depends mostly on the strain and how much smoke consumption you can get because obviously if you're not getting enough smoke in your lungs then you're not getting hot so I don't know which one to test out first geyser so we got the key lime pie plus the sour gorilla which is a hybrid I'm just trying to compare both of the indicas though so not that we go with this dizzy first alright guys so we're gonna take a big fat blink of a note off of this dizzy and tell you guys the full flavor profile what kind of time it gets me get to be right off the bat because with the blinker man you have to feel something right guys so cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 man that's all I'm saying choose the initial flavor flavor that I'm getting I am getting a little hint of like select a line like Elvis citrusy which is pretty freakin cool man none to say the least but I uh I'm also getting that natural like if you guys know if you have ever smoked live resin you guys know that it tastes kind of like it doesn't taste burnt but it does taste like like obviously something very very earthy that like you know it's something completely different than the within what you're used to if you smoke raw garden something completely different man this type of live resin you know is actual live residence how it's like you know the industry standard of live resin and that's what's tizzy puts in the pot so comparing it to the refine light resin though so pretty much what raw garden does what they're refined light resin is they take out any extra lipids and things like that carcinogen I mean I'm not really too sure if it has carcinogens but if they take out pretty much any extras that they really don't feel should be vain alright guys so compared to this one this one might have NEX some extra lipids just from the process of the you know squishing the plant itself as opposed to this that it's gonna take out all that extra stuff so that's why you also get it so clear right so it's just refining it that way you get a better end product it's basically what they're trying to do so without further ado guys I think we should just go in for a fat little toke and yeah choose [Music] oh my gosh dude the raw garden blinkers literally they kill me every time I like I used to when I first started smoking these I used to take blinker after blink after blinker but by now man I don't know what it is but they're just so like so much harsher now and then what they used to be it's out there so much harsher or it's just my lungs they're you know slowly decay ting but either way man it doesn't matter yeah take touch base on both of these though man off the first two initial hits like this one right here I got it was it wasn't as Turkey is what I'm used to to the to the raw Gardens but they that's what sucks about these is they always change man I mean the base flavor profile Oh is always the same you know it's always usually the similar taste but I'm talking about the Terps you'll get some that are really really really chirpy and gassy and they just like you know expand your lungs and destroy your lungs and then you'll get something like these that are kind of kind of subtle like you know the Terps are very very subtle in there but they these always have more Terps in my opinion compared to these live residents from ste I like the the ones from Suzie honestly they're just like very very smooth and they're not too harsh on your throat like I said like I could let you guys saw me take a blinker and just take it like a champ right okay as opposed to this when I was coughing like a little bit after like these are a lot smoother the live resin is they give you the full entourage effect so the highest completely completely different guys all right and that's what I'm gonna touch base next after after the flavor profile so yeah this is like a more plant-based you you're not really getting too much Terps it's more of just getting you the full entourage effect and what that does is basically give you a full spectrum hot alright guys as put to this this one it's just the flavor puffs on this is just turquoise tantrum and likey there's nothing else to say about it I mean not this specific regarde in general you know they're known for being gassy for being therapy and yeah man so flavor-wise I do like the raw garden a lot more so next up on the list though like I was saying we're gonna go based on the highest and I know I'm not I'm not basing the highs as a right now I'm just basing the overall highs that I've had in the my past experiences and I'm gonna just let you guys give you guys the full rundown all right so with with the Stacey live resident I do get the full entourage effect all right which is basically I do feel like very very soothing it's a very very soothing high man and it's not if you take a blinker you're not gonna really feel that high right away it's a high that progresses so every single time that you take a hit you're gonna get more and more high and it's not really a very very rapid high at least for my personal experience is it is a slow high but once you reach that peak level it's a very very enjoyable high as opposed to the raw garden where I feel like this one man you it's just in your face it's just very very in your face but the thing is it doesn't it's like quick it's a quick high you get me so you'll take a hit of this you'll take a blinker hit of this so you get a very very stone you'll feel like like oh my gosh dude like I'm stoned right and it'll last at least for me it'll last for like 20 minutes at most and you know I feel like I have to take another hit to get that high again and it's just not it's not it's not a soothing high as opposed to that how this dizzy is right this one is just like I said like I was saying it's very in-your-face and it's a very being rushed high so you just like you just like oh my gosh you're like I'm a high like I'm super babe and then um you don't really get a chance to just chill out in my opinion you know it's a very very like dude like I'm afraid and I have to get like you know experienced the highest opposed to this one you could just sit down and chill and enjoy the full effects of the plant and how it's supposed to be soothing you which is really really weird man it really goes to show you know the different types how different types of live resin waxes things like that affect your body affect your mind and things like that so take it from take it from my point of view guys you know give different things to try don't just be stuck on one product because you enjoy that hi you know there's you'll probably find something else that you might like a little bit more you know so I think the only thing we we talked a lot right now but I think it's tough to get nice and baked so Cheers [Music] like I'm super bagel I was saying in the beginning of the video I made I want to say it was at least that eight to ten minute video guys for you guys and it it was going so good in my opinion who is it was really really good but I'd like this one's probably gonna come out a lot better just because I picked out my flaws on the last one so this one was just kind of just donating rolling rolling rolling but yeah that kind of pissed me off a little bit but we're already started so really couldn't be too pissed off but I'm just enjoying it I'm enjoying doing these videos for you guys I love the support that you guys have been showing to me man if you haven't already what are you doing man go ahead and hit that subscribe button it supports me more than you think alright guys so let's go in on this raw garden hit next Cheers [Music] therapy super therapy we tell you guys like the flavor profile from the raw garden is just completely different from this dizzy man and I feel like that's what that's what's gonna really make this decision hard is the fact that I feel like these two even though they're both like resin I just feel like they're two completely different things you get me like right here we got a very chirpy pen that's just a very very completely different high right here is something that's very very subtle but it gets you it's a very very soothing high and yours you're getting the full flavor profile from the plant as opposed to this one I mean I don't know I don't know it's like you get me if I smoke the plant well it will it give me the same high is what I'm trying to say it's like I don't feel like I'm gonna get the same high but I like with if I smoke the plant from this but if I were to smoke the plant from this I feel like it would be around the same high you know and it's kind of something that that I don't know if that just kind of brought it to my attention is the fact that you know and why how much can the highs really change from the bud look at that bud state to the wax date you know and it's very very crazy man they're very very crazy guys so I'm gonna be honest with you guys I am NOT gonna be able to decide who's gonna be the winner because like I was saying there are two different completely products and I'm gonna need your help for this one guys all right so let me know in the comments below I want every single person watching this video to comment down below if you've tried these products which one do you think is better and would like tell me why tell me why do you think they're all arms are better tell me why you think this dizzy is better right I want to know your opinions I want to make this interactive video and hopefully you guys are down for it so because I can't really choose I'm gonna need your help on be 100% honest right so I'm gonna drop this video today and you guys are gonna we figure out which is better than what so without further ado I'm gonna end out the video go upload this and so you guys have something to watch alright guys hope you guys have a blessed day don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the next one we practice is a great function on the ground buddy know cuz I've been super buddy I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "Ozu8zi7EOFA": "hi today I'm going to talk about some of the absolute extracts supercritical co2 extracted oils these natural plant medicines come in these beautiful little cartridges that you can vaporize one of the first ones I'm going to talk about is Blue Jay way this is a two-to-one CBD to THC extracted oil this is for someone that needs a little less psychoactive effect and a little bit more pain relief and inflammation relief next one I'm going to talk about very briefly is the blackberry cush this is a very traditional indica you would utilize this particular cartridge for insomnia for getting into a deeper sleep in the beginning of your evening if you're suffering from pain but you would utilize this mostly at night the next three I'm going to talk about are the blue dream which is a hybrid but it leans a little sativa the Girl Scout cookie which seems to be a favorite with a lot of people and it's somewhat in the middle of the road you would have to learn how this feels yourself and the next one is the OG Kush another hybrid that we carry now I'm going to talk about one of our extreme sativas a Sour Diesel it's a very popular sativa this oil you might utilize for creativity some type of an athletic outdoor activity and maybe intimacy with your partner again thank you", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "sYsQ0xNvgZ4": "what's going on guys welcome back it's looney coming at you guys with another video looney reviews welcome back appreciate you guys all tuning in stopping by watch what i got in store for you guys so as you guys know i started my channel reviewing a bunch of stizzies as i like to call it the stizzer and i picked up another scissor um scissor is my way of saying stizzy that's just how i say that's how i call them i like calling them scissors my little thing so this but i'll i'll say stizzy so i don't confuse any new viewers so this daisy product as you know well i just spoiled it i got a stizzy product for you guys i got this rose gold battery that i fully charged that my buddy had to give me he gave me this battery brand new battery just fully charged it today and i also have this gmo cookies for you guys yo you guys already anyone that knows my uh knows me and my content knows gmo is my new favorite strain it has been for some time now ever since it's been released and gmo cookies i had i had to try it and uh from from stizzy i had to give them a try so we're gonna go ahead and uh get right into it so i'm gonna open this up like this just so you guys can see it first actually before i open it up let me give you guys a quick little update on what i had to what my process on getting this card so you guys can go ahead and pause that if you guys want i'm gonna read it off anyways it never focuses so total thc is 74.74 percent total cbd 0.74 milligrams manufactured date and package date this is the big problem you guys manufactured date 0-225-2020 package date zero two twenty six twenty twenty this stizzy pod live resin stizzy pod is about ten months old almost a full year old man that is unacceptable i asked the the the blood tender when he told me i was like hey man i don't want to be too picky but before i walk out out of this is there any way you can uh is it okay if you check you know the manufacture date on the on the on the part you're handing me because i've had a pod that was six plus months old that tasted terrible live resin and i think it was because of how old it was and he told me he looked at all the dates they were literally all this date he had like six or seven more of these pods and they were all the same manufactured date all the same package date so i had no choice but to go ahead and pick it up so hopefully i don't have a terrible experience like i did with i forgot which one it was i think it was the key lime pie but key lime that i had i had got a key lime pie that was really old and it tasted old and it was just all bad but let's go ahead and open it up oh wow this uh it's only oh wow it's only this side it's not even both sides guys i'm so silly i tried to squeeze both sides but it wasn't coming it wasn't working all right thank god thank goodness the oil looks great it's a pill it's a peel-off sticker which is shows you how that it's pretty old beautiful box you already know it's dizzy beautiful packaging gold leaves on the on the product i'm going to take off this peel this peel-on sticker oh i hate i hate these stickers as you would you guys know what i'm talking about is this i hate those stickers so much all right um put this sticker to the side all right boom and look at this this oil looks nice guys look at this this oil looks really nice for how old it is look at that beautiful looking live resin oil the last the key lime pie i had last time was already looking way worse than this it was so much more darker let's go ahead and uh blink so it works all right let's go ahead and give it a dry puff see if we can get any aromas any flavors any smells any all that from gmo cookies oh my god please don't be playing mine tricks on me if i tasted what i think i tasted this is going to be amazing not not a not a very distinct doesn't have a very distinctive uh smell like it doesn't have it i smell weed i smell cannabis but you know we're trying to see what it tastes like man i'm getting i'm getting the gmo it's there i'm getting it i get it a little bit but that's man just because i'm getting it a little bit it's giving me high hopes that i'm gonna taste it a lot as soon as i start vaping the product so let's go ahead and go for the first drag super excited guys gmo cookies let's go in for it cheers first smoke of the day we found it guys gmo this one stizzy did a great job with this gmo live resin cart tastes just like gmo oh my god it's it's oniony garlicky garlicky garlicky uh see i'm already like slurring my words smell the smell is amazing now it's i'm smelling exactly what i would be you know what i would expect to smell from the gmo very herbal very skunky very musky it's garlicky man it's there it's definitely there 100 percent there way more there than the rove way more than the friendly for the friendly farms you didn't wasn't even there at all so whatever their whatever uh stizzy is doing in order to create their gmo batches keep doing this dizzy you're doing a good job that's exactly what i wanted to taste exactly what i wanted to taste oh my god oh i wish i had a gram i wish i had a gram of this i had a gram of mimosa and i didn't enjoy it because then mimosa i didn't enjoy the fl i didn't enjoy the flavor and i didn't enjoy the high because it was a sativa but this is indica as you guys know and it's my favorite strain so it's like the hot i enjoy the medicating effects and i love the flavor so let's go ahead for another another talk cheers uh so you guys get an idea of what i'm tasting it's more it tastes the garlicky oniony taste is a slightly stronger than the live resin taste the live resin taste you get it on the exhale and on the finish when you're done blowing all the smoke out you still get the live resistance there the garlic and the oniony taste is right on the inhale as soon as you inhale as soon as you get you know you're hitting the as soon as you're pretty much hitting the pan you uh and you take uh you finish the hit like you you're inhaling you finish and then as soon as you that you get all that flavor and it's it's amazing it's really i couldn't say i mean man like this is literally 10 out of 10 product in my opinion when it comes to when it comes to accuracy of how the strain is supposed to smell and taste and feel this is all there man this is all there the only other person or person lit the only other company that hit gmo's flavor on the nail and i mean it was perfect it was perfect to the point where i could have swore there was pieces of garlic in the in the damn live resin itself that's how much it tasted amazing and i was just like and that was ursa and and it wasn't the cartridge it was their live resin their concentrate and let me tell you guys man that that gmo flavor was absolutely amazing and i'm sorry for anyone that's like tired of me talking to talking about gmo it's just that you guys know how it is when you guys come across your favorite strain and whether it's in an edible form if that even exists or if it's a pod form or cartridge form or or even like when you get your favorite strain in a bud form it's just nostalgic man you can just sit there and look at it for minutes at a time before even touching it or looking at it or looking at it before like smoking it or doing anything with it you're just there and you just admire the product that's what i was doing with this dizzy box for the longest i was just looking at it like gmo cookies i was just admiring that i actually have what i've been waiting for in the gmo and i'm ex and i've had two other products in rove and friendly farms but the gmo wasn't really there and that frustrates me man half of the experience for me is the flavor so if i'm not getting the flavor of what i'm expecting to be tasting for me that ruins the experience a lot you know so the highs the high in the medicating the medicating benefits of what you feel uh what you feel after you vape your product that's obviously the main point but what helps you enjoy that even more is having an amazing flavor you know and as you guys know i always have stuff coming up and just so you know if you guys are anyone that's still watching this is what i have coming up for you guys mendo breath i had mendo breath uh in a as a percy live rosin form uh from 7 10 and that mendel breath tasted so amazing that i had to that when i seen it at a as a when i seen ursa providing it in a cartridge form have to try it have to give it a try so i have that coming up i also have the ursa battery the battery for ursa for that cartridge that's what i'm going to be reviewing that cartridge using and uh just so you guys know if you guys watch this is where my my current ursa is sitting at this they last a long time dude this cartridge i smoked this cartridge only using a 2.8 volt battery because that's all i had at the time and it lasts me a long time it still lasts me a long time i've had it for almost a week now and for any of you guys that are wondering a week is a long time for me so look i have this coming up too guys garlic cookies oh my god from i've never tried field but this is their c cell cartridge full gram garlic cookies i had to pick it up guys i had to so that's those are the those are you know two more cartridges i got coming up one is mendel breath and another one is pretty much gmo because garlic gmo is garlic cookies so i got garlic cookies and i'm so excited for that just because i've never tried field anything i've never tried any of their products and support they claim to have received uh number one vape uh at some point you know it's on their website fieldextracks.com and also field extracts uh on instagram so you guys want to check them out so i got those coming up if you guys want me to check out any specifics let me know like for example if you want me to try out a sativa or indica or hybrid or a specific strain in a cartridge and you want me to just try something out like for example hey looney yeah can you try heavy hitters lava cake like something like that dude feel free to drop in the comments or hit me up personally uh if you guys know my instagram or hit or just comment below as easy as that just comment below i'll look at all the comments i read all the comments i try to reply to all of them so and uh when it comes to the comment section go ahead and feel free to just let me know what you guys want to see next for me you know just that'd be a lot easier for me because for me uh it's hard for me to go out and buy like oh gee kush like i hate og kush just because of the i'm not a fan of the flavor i hate that i'm not gonna say hate hate is a strong word even though i already said it i take it back but i don't i really dislike that heavy og taste i don't know for some reason i'm just not a fan of it um so i would never ever pick up og anything on my own unless it was for example mr nice og i purposely was like let me try try this for you guys you know i wanted this uh i was purposely thinking maybe one of you guys would are curious about it so that's why i did that but it would be so much better and easier on my part if and if it doesn't you guys don't have to i'm still gonna uh bring products and stuff it's just usually it's gonna majority of the time it's gonna be product that's around my my my taste and my my my my favoring so it's always going to be like usually hybrids and indicas i don't usually uh i don't usually orbit around specific strains i like to like gorilla glue is my favorite uh one of my favorite hybrids so you know gorilla glue is something that i usually wouldn't try just because i i'm very familiar with gorilla glue but if you guys wanted me to try it then i would try it but then again that makes you know that's the only reason why i'm able to be so critical on on these kind of products because i know what i'm supposed to be expecting from gmo so if it doesn't taste or hit like gmo i'm gonna be able to you know tell you guys exactly what it's missing and what it needs so i wouldn't necessarily not do a girly glue video or a strain video that's very common i would love to do those videos but just go ahead and let your boy know let you boy know what you want to see i'm i'm starting to ramble man this [ __ ] has me lit all right let's go let's go in for another lit uh another lid let's go in for another hit this [ __ ] excuse my language if you're 18 or younger hop off the video 21 or younger hop off the video i forgot to say that so youtube's not on my ass because they already are let's go in for another one man this thing has me beyond medicated past the point i need to be but let's go ahead and go for another one it's another one cheers first smoke of the day for anyone wondering super smooth on the lungs and the chest i don't feel anything barely anything going down my throat like this [ __ ] is super smooth super smooth smells amazing oh my god it smells so good so this specific gmo cookies if you guys are curious or wondering anything about it it

this product weeks after it was manufactured oh my god i mean i would hope it doesn't change much i hope i'm just experiencing what it would have been regardless but i could i mean you know come you know any normal thinking what's with which i'm just looking at admiring the oil now the oil looks beautiful any normal thinking would go to think that the longer it sits the the worst oil is going to get obviously but no complaints so zero complaints on this part 10 out of 10 i won't even rate pods i don't the reason why i don't rate uh cartridges or any of the products i do is because everything

unreal I'm in the vapor pen industry simply because I know that you can be - one of the most important parts of being in the vapor pen game is understanding what cartridge you should buy though what do you do when there's so many of them my name is Drew owner of mr. extractor calm my terpene profiles are in millions of pens all around the country I'm here today to tell you the truth about what cartridge you should use in today's episode how to pick your THC cartridge and the terpene Institute [Music] okay so look you've got your distillate and you've got your terpenes and it tastes really good and you're loving it and you're like what products should I pick look we can go on for hours about the differences in cartridges and to be honest with you later when I have a little bit more time I'm gonna bring in some vape cartridge manufacturers and they're gonna explain the exact differences but what I'm gonna do today is give you just a common-sense breakdown of some of the things you're gonna run into when picking out a cartridge for your line now without getting into all the intricacies of every different cart that is a whole nother thing I don't manufacture carts I don't want to manufacture carts I could it is a huge pain in the ass with a million competitors and no money I don't deal with it for a million different reasons but I can tell you a few things when we first started this company we were testing our terpenes with distillate and we're like dude this sucks we suck we don't know what we're doing we should probably give this up we tried a different cartridge after a couple months everything we had tasted better it tasted right I was like oh my god this whole time it's been the damn cartridge we never knew all cartridges are not created equal aside from their whole sizes and their glass and the tips and all that stuff some of them just don't taste good it can make your product taste like [ __ ] so what I always recommend when you first start out grab like five different cartridges just in general just start which one tastes best you're gonna have to look at a whole bunch of different parameters when you're operating taste is gonna be one of the most important followed by cloud size it's hard to debate on even which one is more important that if it leaks it's no good to anybody so instead of going over every single different aspect I'm gonna save that for a whole series of videos where I bring in a vapor pen a couple vapor pen manufacturers and we're gonna go over every different aspect of the cartridge and why you should or shouldn't pick one based on that the problem with that is everything's evolving all the time so let me just tell you kind of some of the pitfalls you're gonna run into keep it simple so first off your cartridge can taste different depending on the manufacturer it can make your good product taste like crap we got tricked at that one very early in the industry like I said we didn't realize it was the damn cartridge we thought we didn't know we were doing I'm sure you guys have run into that too always try a few different pens now you can find a pen that tastes great the battery it's coupled with can also make it taste like crap we do so much testing here I've honestly ran through thousands and thousands and thousands of cartridges that we've personally tried and I understand the differences between a lot of them but sometimes we ran into this well we thought our test was terrible begin later it was a stupid cartridge again even from the same manufacturer China is not the most honorable country in the world believe it or not they sell you a bunch of good stuff once they say bunch of crap the next time to offload some parts so make sure that you have a consistent quality supplier make sure that your cartridge tastes good if your cartridge does not taste good try it with a different battery it is essential that you understand that the combination between the cartridge and the battery is crucial you can have an excellent cartridge with a different type of battery it burns it too hot not hot enough tastes like [ __ ] vice versa so before you even go into business you need to pick the battery that you want to use make sure that you can get a lot of them a couple it with the cartridge you want to do use make sure that you can get a lot of those too and then start adjusting your product based on that now there's all sorts of different types there's the wicks there's a ceramic there's the C sells so many different parameters that you want to operate under exactly I don't do this but what I can tell you is that if you're running into problems our products taste good we've tasted we've tested them in a bunch of different products enough to know that we can't control the manufacturers of the battery in the car switch your battery try something different switch your cartridge try something different it's not traditionally and it's not our terpenes it's most likely your cartridge some of them burn hot some of them leak whatever make sure you get a cartridge that doesn't leak leave your pens out for a week set them out and a little bit of heat you don't want it running out into your packaging and ruin your product giving you a bad name so many things on the cartridge aspect so I'm leery to even get into it that's something that you know again for the millionth time I don't like getting into just because of the variety of things when you're buying a cheap product from China I've seen so many things from those people over there that it's just crazy you don't need to spend the most amount of money now I can tell you this for product testing I used some of the cheapest carts that I can find I use the weight carts just a simple black ones with the wick they taste great they don't blow the hugest cloud but it really pulls out the aroma it doesn't burn the oil they're inexpensive they taste great other people they want to use the really expensive ones that's cool depends on your product if you're growing really good clouds and all that what I can tell you is that the amount of terpenes that you use with the wick system is gonna differ from the amount you use with a/c so if you got something that burns really hot it's gonna flash off more terpenes at one time altering the taste versus something that does it a little bit slower make sure that you watch some of our other videos I'll probably pop a link up here as to what video should watch on how to blend your terpenes based on how they flash off and why you can't do things smell versus taste because turkeys do flash off at different amounts of different temperatures so if you got some major ass coil you're burning them all off real quick it's gonna hurt your throat versus something a little softer it is a combination of events just like these terpenes we've got 20 different things that work together in harmony mixed with your THC mixed at a certain temperature mixed with the oxygen and hit your mouth and create a pleasant flavor it's complex your pen is the same thing you've got your cartridge you've got how this kiss your distal it is how many terpenes you have what temperature you're vaping it out how the voltage of the battery is affecting it you are creating a symphony of items that everything's just as important the THC gets you high that stuff's the flavoring the battery supplies the power the cartridge does the burning you gotta orchestrate it right or you're gonna come out with the poor product the good news is all you got to do is just try some things process of elimination get your cart throw a few different batteries which one tastes better throw a few different carts on the same battery just narrow it down it's not that hard then stick with it talk to the manufacturer and say hey man can you get these all the time how long have you been in business do you switch the model all the time carts man or something else someday we'll come up with something even better than a car right so look the terpene Institute was founded just to give you a simple common-sense understanding of the terpene industry and how to make money from it I'm going to expand into cannabis and business lines but for right now just helping you understand how this works aside from all the crazy stupid [ __ ] that you find on social media I'm here only to tell you the truth because simply the more products you sell the more products I sell I'm gonna do my very best to make sure that you sell the most things that you can and make the most money you can alright as we gonna spend it here so go to mr. extractor com we've got all the different terpene profiles there watch some of the other videos you should watch them all college is expensive and you can't learn what I'm teaching you anywhere college that you go to you're gonna have some broke-ass professor teaching you something he doesn't know anything about you can take it from a person that started this industry that is a multi-millionaire and teach you how to do the same thing I ain't gonna charge you alright thank you for watching see if the terpene is to the next video take it easy [Music]", "E3Kk0bbrS4I": "all right so dr. Dean here in Anaheim California 2017 the cannabis big business convention here so I've heard convection is doing a lot of really cool and interesting things in the industry and how did all this stuff get started my friend yeah you know we actually started as a product company because we don't need to disrupt this industry it's a bunch of Chinese nonsense right dangerous components we don't know what so we started with a line it became very very popular you've probably seen getting done with all these products and so so did you bring a lot of the manufacturing for this to the United States or did you do have your guys design it and outsource or bring it in yeah it's interesting so it's something we wanted to do crazy but what we learned was that this is only a small piece of the puzzle the scalable part of the business was trying to get to all the consumers oh people watching this really don't care about how many different companies that are out there they just want an actual cartridge or if it works it doesn't leak because it works with all the different batteries right it has quality oil and that's all the occur and it doesn't have any dangerous weird metals that are off gassing things that you have no idea what they are right so after we developed our line we built equipment actually fill these things we actually that is what this amazing here then you kind of pan and follow see look at that high-speed cameras kill oh look what I found but it was not low as therefore so facilitating shark who's our system in 30 seconds I've been our captive machine that's about to be released our second clue and so in a big dude like me it's a hold of a machine like this or all of our you know wonderful people in the cannabis industry we all know we're very soft and digital of everything right yeah so when there's somebody in here that's man a lightness and breaking it what is the misery isn't like common issues now or you guys worked out a lot of the kinks and it's pretty smooth [Music] watching this person in a room bumping with like a mascot saw the labs we've seen no so our goal was automating standardize the industry like medical grade it's supposed to be a fiery not deprive on himself once we do that we both that we develop the packaging and the last thing that was remaining those devices and we've developed we now believe it's the perfect cartridge the cartridge that we think most people will be using in the next you know sixty to ninety days all cartridges can no longer leak see one house walls another he walked the top bill they won't have dangerous metals inside you won't have for the wicking system of this is made of white ceramic all ceramic no pot no coil never like stainless steel coil it also uses also phone all gold-plated contacts so there's no battery issues the cartridge or you know it gets down to like a quarter the tang again so not working or something goes in their system and you know what I bet I bet you put it figured out where people can use the your companies can use this sort of cartridge and it still doesn't make them have to totally lose their price point on sale not at all it's actually big pulled out of mush actually this is this is less expensive and almost every other countries in the world pretty amazing just for your honor we own the production be smart we're not fine are you gonna tell us the price point well it depends on what's going in the oil so if you want the price point is a relative to your fine looking to the consumer for sure yeah to the growth price points begin you know very very impressive so I would say compare this cartridge against any other question well guys I'm definitely taking someone to test out all the competition the code from Co ve the codes okay very cool analyst and I think this is awesome what is the best way for people to find you find your products and come back to him calm or Danny at convective email me find us on Twitter have a good confluence team thank you", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "hm8i0oYz-Ww": "I'm tank vape welcome to the channel debate medical cannabis subscribe for weekly content today we're doing a review on Mary's distillate by Mary's medicinals it's the THC blend so there's no strain I wouldn't get the starter kit you can't get the cartridge by itself now if you're not familiar with Mary's medicinals they're based out of Colorado that are known for their effective and award-winning products this is what the cartridge looks like 500 milligram as you can see I've been medicating it is rolling with the ceramic black flat mouthpiece one thing about Mary's dis lid is on very simple as far as the ingredients they don't use any fillers or any solve in some it's the ethanol extracted cannabis oil in Turkey you can just get the cartridge by itself but I purchased a starter kit and the reason why is with the starter kit you get this nifty little battery here alright you can see the USB charge it also has the screw in for the cartridge then this right here would be the LED screen I told you how much percentage your battery is tells you what your amperage is has a ten-second lockout and even has a counter for you from when you've taken a pool you can get an aqua micro dose it looks like put together as you can see is very compact slim sleek I really love the design this is how you turn it on it's five klicks to turn it on oh this is your adjustable arrows you know up down so go ahead and get this started for you guys see here one two oh I already had it on as you can see I'm sitting at 98% 97 oh I love top you get hit with this like kind of sweet taste then it goes into like this earthy piney trying to do then it goes into of like a flower or soapy type deal of um it's not bad let me try this again yeah same thing yeah definitely hit you with the sweet in the beginning then it goes into like this piney earthy taste didn't hit you like this flower like lavender soap type deal from I'm describing that would probably be like the hell is this but actually is not bad you don't think bait reviews we have a point system see where this cartridge ranks on dang great reviews we judge out for three categories which are taste potency in value or the max amount of points for each category is five and then a lot of points to be adding rape is tuned and then maximum amount of points to be adding rape is 15 so let's see where Mary's dissolutes fits on 10 great reviews so first up is taste for taste I'm gonna give it a 5 the taste is not gonna be for everybody just because I'm a goes from a sweet to look like a piney earthy kind of taste then to finish it off with like a lavender flower so P type deal like I said what I'm describing normally would be like what the hell is this but actually I'm like impressed so for taste 5 next up is potency for pouncing I'm gonna give it a 5 this cartridge is tested between eighty eighty five percent THC it definitely grabs you addition to where you need to go quick fast in the hurry and I mean it's a THC blend so for potency 5 I last but not least value for value I'm gonna give it a four depending on where you get the cartridge from can run you fifty bucks I guess um if obviously if you get the StarTAC it's gonna run you a little bit more um but hey what you get in return I think it's a fair trade or I'm the battery like I said suggestible it helps with micro Dossey you know the percentage you could do the paradise now some add up our scores for taste we have five for posse we have five and for value we have four so that brings us courts of 14 it's a dank vape you know I'm not going to tell you to run out and you know go have it you know just having some fun I'm however if you're familiar with Mary's medicinal zone I would say go get the cartridge if you haven't tried it on the stage true just with all the rest of their products um it works is it effective and it's potent so yeah I would definitely uh you know check it out if you ever come across it so before in this video real quick see I picked up some new subscribers so uh thank you welcome to the channel to everybody who's been reaching out to me I definitely will be getting back to you I've been very very busy all of a sudden I know a little bit behind on this review I apologize for that I've actually been working on a couple other projects that aren't cannabis related aren't even YouTube related so you know there's been doing other things and um to everyone appreciate the support I'm gonna keep doing these reviews and until next time keep baking in vaping y'all", "SqF2cx-UgYs": "we are going to review another vape cartridge this is optimum and if you had watched that video you know that this is the first brand that I have purchased a second time simply because I liked it and I wanted one that I liked so this is a different strain however so I'll let you know if I noticed any differences and what the effect of the strain is imma let you know how it tastes right now and that should cover most of the bases and then of course the cost and if I think we should buy it again or not so as far as optimum products I think we should buy it again because I have the last one I had was the sativa this one's an indica and the last strain was Green crack this one is taco og so love the last one hopefully I like this one just as much let's go rundown on the analysis which is the same so the analysis is as follows the strain is Tahoe og the potency analysis is a CBD a zero percent total eighty four point three four percent THC eighty four point three four percent sea wheedies one point zero seven percent in THC zero percent there anything else interesting there harvest a manufacturing date it has a used by a date of November eighth of 2017 but if you watch my review you know that we should be buying these like the day we want to use them of the day after if you want to know why that is check out the video I'm going to crack this open see if anything stands out that I should mention otherwise we're gonna go ahead and throw it on our battery and get to smoking on it so one of the things I love about the optimum cartridges and we'll get a little closer up on this thing you're not gonna stand up in ruin are you okay one of the things I love about these is this top piece like on most of them it's plastic and it feels plastic and this actually feels like metal it may be plastic but it's actually way heavier I never had the top come off like on all these the tops always pop off and I have to move them the one nice thing about that is if I I can line up the mouthpiece in whatever direction I want to for heading purposes to line it up with where the button is and being able to see the smoke but these in particular these Optimum's they are pretty awesome because it's just a high call you this one weighs a lot more than say this one and it's not just that half gram of oil missing it's just you can feel the quality and these optimum cartridges and I really appreciate that I like the extra weight and I was a tube running all the way up and down which none of the others do and maybe that's why it's such highly comes highly recommended and this cartridge was picked up in Auburn at Evergreen market and there is their logo the first thing I love about these is the quality of the cartridge seems to be extremely high and I love the flavor in my last one because it tasted like weed so let's get down and smoking it I'll let you know what this tastes like and the girl told me to sold this to me when I asked her which one she preferred they were both indicas but they only had two of these optimum extracts available and they're both indicas and asked her which one she recommended out of two that were available and she was very gung-ho on Tahoe Tahoe when it came to flavor and effect she said if you want to fall asleep smoke this so we'll see I have a pretty decent tolerance so if it makes me pass out then it definitely I will hit you at least all right let's smoke it and see what she tastes like this brand always produced a lot of smoke too and it hits me pretty good the I've noticed that the two are these five that I like and I actually didn't mention this video we're both kind of harsh which I liked it's a good harsh in the three that didn't really give me two stone well good we're really smooth I don't know if has anything to do with there was just a coincidence Peck hey okay so wow that was one really big hit it tasted not quite as like we'd as the other optimum did the green crack but it doesn't taste super perfumey well not perfume me at all but it doesn't taste like the green crack I'm gonna actually take a smaller hit so I can focus more on the flavor well welcome back everyone it's been about 45 minutes or so and this definitely started hitting I mentioned on the camera even during smoking it that I was already starting to feel it and it probably progressed for about 20-30 minutes when it peaked it it had an indica feel it didn't completely knocked me on my ass but yeah it definitely had a heavier indica type of hide to it I'm about 45 minutes in like I said starting to come down but I still definitely am feeling the effects and it's pretty nice so I took basically two hits off it did hit real fast and it's still kind of going I'm gonna hit it one more time and get back to work but not bad I really like it this optimum extracts is seems to be really quality stuff I would prefer I do think I like that sativa green crackle OH", "PXP64j29ueM": "what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie

personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome

i've used already so i apologize about that but i have placed it back in the original starting position so first thing that you want to notice in any cartridge if it's not hitting it usually means there's a space right on the bottom here that means there's a space here but the leak-proof portion has not been activated we pull the top off when we're ready to use it now avoiding touching this sorry avoiding touching this blue rubber stopper here because we don't want to pull that off unless with that tamper with it we want to grab the top classic portion here and notice this part here I'm going to press down and turn okay and I can pull it back up for you so you can see the movement there we go so again now touching the blue thing not pulling it out you're going to grab the top and a press you're going to turn as soon as you do that in about 10 seconds the product is gonna be ready to use grab the tip click it back on give it 10 seconds or so and go ahead and use it", "GtcDoDmhX8M": "[Music] what is up i am trevor with green social here today to review a product that has come to our doorstep i'm excited to actually dive into this it is actually a company out of washington um they're called elevated this is one of their five different flavors of distillate cartridges we're going to get into this a little bit deeper but i want to start out by talking about the packaging elevated has done a really good job of branding their cartridges also they're gummies but today we're we're just going to focus on this the pineapple crush is the flavor that we're going to be testing out today but i want to look at this and talk about how cool kind of badass this is it reminds me of 90's grudge i love the color profile on the packaging it's really unique of course it pops whenever you see it i think this is something i would gravitate towards let's take a look at the back i love that they actually kind of briefly talk about the experience of what you're going to get out of this out of this cartridge it talks about the flavor the effects the thc it gives me a visual overall i think this is really cool packaging i'm just going to give it a five out of the gate i like it i'm gonna give it a five all right so let's break into this bad boy i love a i love a pretty pretty new cart the look of the actual distillate in here it looks really nice it's got a ambery yellow to it a really pretty look looks clean overall i think it looks really good it's pretty standard looking nothing special about the actual cartridge i think i'll give this just a four but i do like this i think it's fine so this next section is going to be about the flavor really kind of excited because it's pineapple i love pineapple i'm happy i didn't get a strawberry or like a watermelon which i'm sure are great flavors but pineapple it has a very specific taste to it so that's what's so exciting so i'm just going to kind of just just briefly you know just get a little taste just a little taste oh wow okay the pineapple the pineapple is there i like that oh pineapple baby okay okay i'm gonna rip it i'm gonna rip it real good [Laughter] pineapple's there baby oh yeah the flavor profile on it is is very prominent you can definitely taste the pineapple which is nice and on on the pineapple crush it's not burning even on that bigger rip it didn't burn it was really really smooth the flavor is good and this is all about flavor i am going to give it a 5. i think the flavor is there um the hit was really smooth even on like my normal hit it was really smooth the flavor is just superior here that's all you really can can really taste is and that's what you get you get a mouthful of pineapple crush overall i feel like it was really balanced so we'll talk about the aroma of this i think it's pretty obvious to me it has a pineapple you know scent it met my expectations and i mean it kind of exceeded it but i felt like that was more in the the actual flavor that exceeded it but the the aroma is the aroma was good i'm gonna give it i think a four i think it's fine so we're on to the effects it's it hits hard it hits quick i'm gonna give it a five i mean whenever i'm smoking flour and it's it's a sativa um usually you're smoking it's like five ten minutes you're smoking a joint it's done but the effects kind of it's like 20 minutes with this it hits hard it hits fast and whenever i feel like whenever i smoke it at home i'm just gonna go straight inside and just start doing the dishes usually i get like 20 30 minutes before i'm like peak high at home where i'm like okay now we can go do it do active things clean up the house whatever you want to do i feel a little bit more calm and a little bit more yes i feel more energetic but at the same time i feel a little bit better i feel more more balanced here i really enjoy it i'm a flower guy so i always go back to enjoying flower but i think the effects on this have been pretty delightful overall i thought it was really good cartridge all the the categories that we went down i think it did really good in all those categories the packaging i i love the packaging i go back to now i want to go skate or go play tony hawk's underground 2 american wasteland like i just you know overall i think it was a good experience 23 of 25. in my opinion i'm gonna in my opinion i really enjoyed it and i'm gonna be looking for them at a dispensary hopefully near me hopefully i can pick these up these might be my regular thing i enjoyed the flavor i enjoyed the effects overall elevated i think that they knocked it out of the park let me know if you pick up one of the five flavors of these hellevated cartridges i would love to hear your experience", "XpHVOECvZSI": "hello YouTube I'm Austin and I'm Kailyn and this is but in the pod room so today we got our daily text from House of cannabis our dispensary here on Broadway in El Cajon and every day we get a text of what kind of special deals they have going on this year so i called my daily discount text definitely and so we had seven grams of private reserve for 55 so that's what KO yeah on you know on this picked up I feel a lot of bud yeah yeah for sure and then we both actually got some edibles today for for cheap to hell these uh these candy care we've shouted them out before the grant great stuff or 100 mils I got for $25 great deal super stoked on him these are these are some watermelon candy that I'm assuming they're like sour patch kids yeah but stoked on it cuz it was a lot of my favorite candy you know I had two packages of 400 ml of water melon strips last night so 800 ml total and I slept like a baby I do not sleep in but I mean cameraman slept in till like 1:00 p.m. yeah it was I couldn't even get ahold of them and then I got myself this TKO Casey punch for sure this is not uh not as many milligrams but these are shatter infused they're not made with Bud Light and a lot of edibles are and what's really cool about this if they have a lot they have a very high CBD also between the whole plant infuse extract super nice line here you can see they're they're organic whole plant extracts not so the entire said never saw it before oh so that what is it six grams of I wouldn't know what's that what's the company how much heavy so it's 200 milligrams of shatter shatter in that in that shadow was made with a whole plant like the doctor who we did a review on it yes so definitely very high CBD along with high THC I'm excited to eat this whole thing tonight I'm going going out downtown gonna be having a rip-roaring for my trip tonight - I also got this Green Wave cartridge these um are a little more expensive than the ones I usually get I usually get platinum vape ones because I have this really awesome buttonless platinum vape battery it works like a charm so I usually get just the Platinum vape cartridges for that because they work really well but this Green Wave it just it I mean it looks really really nice on that color super super golden amber color yeah and very liquidy - more oily than then like a lot of the other ones you see definitely it's a it moves a lot quicker and a lot of the others a lot of the other cartridges you get they have a lot of I've ever really thick oil on the inside so you get it stuck up at the top and then you got to sit and wait like half an hour - how about just stuff like that lot autumn so you can use it but yeah it looks very very it looks like it'll burn a lot quicker or easier at the most and with this the the Green Wave's they're 500 milligrams of organic co2 that this oil is made with organic co2 that is so I'm I'm feeling good chief and on this a lot I'm not feeling bad at all we're gonna be just dump in some of this bud that I picked up in salad days here not a tradition and smoking some of it some of the stuff we haven't have you picked up some rascal and I think some mr. nice that we've had before so we're just gonna go throw that inside of salad days but yeah let's open up these let's open up this stuff and have a look at it I'm honestly really excited to do a review on this cartridge because I've only ever had a green wave cartridge like once and it wasn't in indica so it wasn't like my preferred cartridge either but yeah I mean that was a while ago so I'm definitely excited to give this another shot I have two batteries here I have this 710 or if you want to flip it upside down oil battery and it's the first ever battery that has had a carb that I've never seen that before it's really really cool you just put your finger over this little hole right here and then all these light up and hits like a charm I'm thinking I'm gonna use it on my 7/10 battery just because it's a stronger battery I picked

"VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "SK6Y8GCm4i8": "hey it's mad at Rafal studios and welcome to the blazing gear review of the Mystica 2 cartridge vaporizer now let's get started here's what comes in the box on the back of the box is the instruction manual for the air is Mystica inside you have the tiny little Mystica unit itself and then there's the accessories packet in the bottom it has the two magnetic connectors and the USB ribbon charging cable now let's take a closer look at the Aris Mystica this thing is really tiny as you can see it fits right in the palm of your hand and then at the big port there is for the cartridge to go into now keep in mind these do not includes any cartridges this is for your own prefilled cartridges or cartridges that you fill up in the bottom you have the USB charging port on the side there is a little window for you to look in and see the volume of your cartridge and then on the front is the logo and the single function button and as you can see through that little window there the cartridges slide in and then if you don't have the ring adapters on there they won't magnetically stick in there so those little adapters that come in there are four it fits three different sizes this is for the smaller size here but it also has an adapter for the 510 threads that I'll show you in a second which would probably the most common here in the US I see once you put the ring adapter on there it just pops right in there and then it will stick in the bottom there it's a really nice secure connection at the bottom and then like I said there's the 510 thread adapter which does a very similar thing and on this one there is no cap to close or anything like that so it really doesn't matter about the length of the cartridge pretty much any size cartridges as long as it fits that diameter will work in there [Music] right so now we're going to charge it up and take a look at the functions and features when you charge it it has a little red ring around the charger and then I'll turn green once it's fully charged and this device clicks on with five clicks to turn it on and then you press it two times and it'll cycle through its heat cycle and you can see the colors changed and indicate the place in the cycle that it's at and then you can end the cycle by pressing at one time and then it has three different heat settings that you can scroll through by three clicks of the device with a low medium high and then it'll indicate with the color on the outside which which of the heat setting it's on and then you cut it off with five clicks so it's simple to operate and it's nice that it has three different voltage settings alright so now we're going to jump into the usage and testing and you can see I'm using this prefilled cartridge here with a small ring adapter and then I also have a larger cartridge to try out as well I really was very happy with this device it's tiny but I got really good hits it hits just as good as any of these types of pens very compact design it's easy to use the big hits I love the three temperature settings and it's very affordable so I think it's a really good value entry-level vaporizer and the cons are that it's those little connectors are easy to lose so if you lose those little cartridge connectors you're in trouble so make sure you keep up with those I'm giving it four stars I think it's a excellent little device and", "KrDeg0eTO0A": "[Music] hello everyone thanks for stopping by I'm Dave and today we're checking out the selecting leat cherry pie half grand cartridge this cartridge is lab tested and contains eighty three point seven percent THC and 95 percent the CBD I bought this cartridge from connected cannabis in Stockton and a link to their read maps menus in the description to open the box you have to push in on the tab and pull up on the flap at the same time let's see how I do this for my first time [Music] [Music] with a little effort the package is beating and we can take our first look at this partner now let's see some close-ups [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright I'm gonna get this cartridge plugged into my yo can uni but before I do let you check out that [Music] the bubble in this cartridge doesn't move at all in room temperature which is a great sign now I'm gonna get my settings dialed in to take my first hit from this select delete and show you five cartridges and as I do let me know down the columns have you had the chance to check out anything from select cartridges and what did you think of them so what did I think of this cartridge this select partner she joins my short list of five-star cartridges slow-burning potent and with a sweet berry flavor this cartridge has it all I love this cartridge I would highly recommend you check one out for yourself if you see this at your dispensary pick one up I purchased this from connected cannabis in Stockton and a link to their week maps menus in the description hey fam I had a great time showing you this cartridge and I hope you come back and join me next time and until then have an awesome day [Music]", "TsI5MwjR_tw": "hey there so i wanted to show you how i got this vape open i finally went upstairs and had my husband help me with this vape um i just was showing it to you the high supply hybrid vape so i was really struggling to get it open it's the child resistant part was really tricky for me and i will say it's not their fault i have lotion on my hands so it made it somewhat tricky to get out but you just push the tube up like this you can throw away this cardboard thing recycle it whatever i love that this is so minimal with the packaging and then you have this reusable tube that you can roll pre-rolls in or whatever and keep it in your purse i love that it comes like this um so this is this is how you get it off you just twist the top off i was thinking it was like one that you pull off so the trick is just twist it so that's what my husband did so i wanted to show you this um this is a 500 milligram disposable vape and it's really rare to find ones in illinois that are 500 milligrams disposable style typically 500 milligrams or more of the cartridge that you like screw on the top so to get one that's disposable with 500 milligrams and it was only 50 dollars which is a steal for me i know that sounds funny because in other states that is extremely high prices but here this is a very good price so i like it that there's no buttons on it it'll last me a long time you just draw from this end right here and then this end right here will light up letting you know that you did it right so i want to give it a try and see what this high supply is all about it's a big big brand like i've seen high supply really making a big effort with their marketing lately they're really crushing it so yeah really excited to try this so this one is a hybrid strain it's not like any particular it's just like a blend that is very good i like that um it tastes almost like a lime and it smells that way like even from this like cap like that on the top i can smell it has a very citrus note but it's very limey and very pleasant like a very functionable feeling to it like i can definitely you know use this you know go to a conference call or do whatever i need to do for work or go on a bike ride very very of a functional kind of high it's a hybrid strain like i said and the thc percentage on this was pretty good so it's um 74 thc which that's very high that's pretty good like um just as a reference point if you're somewhat new to the percentages um one of the very very very best strains of cannabis like that you grow like the bud that would be like 35 maybe 38 thc at the very highest so 38 thc from the bud versus 74. 74 is very strong so this this will do the trick and i like these because it's just potent clean medicine you just take a couple hits a few minutes later a few seconds later i will feel different i will feel more calm so this is great and i can't wait to use this i'm going to go on a hike or a bike ride i'm not sure which one but yeah i just wanted to show you this i was so excited that i finally got it open but yeah this is the high supply hybrid disposable vape it's also technically from cresco so if you're interested in that kind of thing check out cresco check out one of their dispensaries called sunnyside in illinois but yeah really happy with this this is going to treat me really well all right hope you have a good day happy sunday to you all right take care bye"}
