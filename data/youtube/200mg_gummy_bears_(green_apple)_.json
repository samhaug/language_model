{"H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "UgDQ0zsfvVY":

his eyes are getting kind of red man i'm baked let's make that right here let's go to the light a bit so these uh people can see how red the eyes are um so guys um i shouldn't say guys i don't like that hey you look at those eyes right there that's what those edibles do after one hour that's 500 milligrams of delta 8 thc um edibles man they're frying me already hell yeah it's been what are you expecting in the next 30 minutes sleeping probably so we'll see if we get any more of this are they sativa indica or what just distilling distillate oh so [ __ ] blacks is that what that is i guess you could call it delta 8 wax i mean wax is desolate um i guess but there's different methods of extracting it like co2 and bho and i guess the consistency determines what you call it but it's just distal it's just super thick and sticky and uh basically the gummies just regular gummies and they actually spray it with the actual thc oil oh wow so you're when you eat the gummies you're literally eating the straight oil on the actual gum that's insane i don't think i heard like a word you said because i'm just [ __ ] just going in and out of my eyes oh okay [Laughter] you feel [ __ ] up oh [

uh yeah i hope you enjoyed the video hit that like hit the like", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually. (chill beat)", "FP1aimwBPm0": "[Music] what's going on youtube i'm high i'm low and this is high on the low what do we got on the menu today low we got some cannabis infused green apple fruit juice by smoky edibles sounds good we're looking good all right man so uh we got some green gummies today fruit juice green apple flavor 100 milligram deal um 10 pieces uh uh high on the low first uh two milligrams of cbd so we'll see what that throws into the mix kind of interesting first time trying some little cbd in it huh vegan gluten free all right for all you health nuts out there um let's see what we got here um it's powered by loud tech very professional packaging um it has an expiration date best buy for 21 21 so you know we're not eating spoiled products it's always good to see expiration dates that shows that they pay attention and they put the time in so that's also good to see um it's saying two hour wait time that's uh that's kind of longer than the other ones in those videos so hopefully um we see uh we see effects a little bit quicker because two-hour wait time you know it'll lose a couple of points for that as well if that's the case and what i'm saying is with two-hour wait time come in handy two-hour wait time yeah like what are you gonna pop this before you go in the dmv you know unfortunately um lost some points on low yeah lost some points critical points um this we keep we kept the pack in uh room temp and apparently um you know things got a little mushy was it recommended to keep it in the room time i don't know it doesn't have any temperature recommendations so um we highly recommend um you know making sure you're keeping this in a cool environment maybe even keep it in the fridge to be honest um so as far as the actual as far as the actual texture and stuff like that it's uh it's a green gummy um it was sugar coated but that that appears to have melted hope it gets infused with this right um but uh 100 milligrams uh 10 milligrams per piece so we have three pieces here we did separate them properly uh measured them out because safety is important you want to make sure that you when you're eating edibles you're using measurements hello yeah you got about 10 serving sizes per package so um so yeah let's try it out all right one for you sir you know guys i already like i really like the green stuff anything green i like i just mean it's gonna be sour in my in my opinion damn they gave me the big one all right guys cheers mmm actually got that green thing i was talking about anything green has that sour nice flavor to it one tastes inside shirt they get points for that i don't know man it's all over the place all of my teeth i do taste a little thc i'll take csc definitely it tastes a lot more but um it's

hard we can't even get our thoughts together my thoughts are together bro hello we got a little different episode for them today right so different a little redemption yeah you know getting a second chance you", "oONRHdBHFfY": "hey love Sistani here and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about a new company that I was recently introduced to and all about how it helped me relax more so this company is called diamond CBD and you know a CBD is and you already know what I'm about to talk about my basically CBD is a what is it it's a component that's found in green and that's the component that makes you actually relax and feel better that's than what's actually helping a lot of people with their illnesses and pains and all that stuff so this company actually just done the work to actually take the CBD out of lead and separate it and put it into different products and all of that so you can actually they have a variety of products so depending on what you prefer you can get whatever so I got this candy cuz I'm obsessed with it means like I don't know why lately I'm in love with these rainbow gummy so not even gonna lie to you guys when I first saw this company I thought it was leave like we'd have just food food and I was like don't do drugs I don't know how that's gonna work but but that company like they explained it to me and then they have a video on the front of their site that actually explains all of this so you do not make you high they don't get you high at all you're not going to be like tripping or anything like that they literally just make you relax and feel more I don't know like say you have back pain like I normally no back pain it helped with that if you have issues sleeping if you have just a problem like with anxiety whatever and you just need to be relaxed this is for you it also helps with a bunch of other things okay so you do need to be 21 to use this or to purchase this and so on the front when I got this package I actually did not review this bottom part here I just saw this and then I went straight to the back because I started reading you know the serving size and it said four pieces so I'm like eating eating and I ate three pieces right to eat my fourth and then I see on the front and it says do not exceed more than one to two pieces every six hours so I took three like I said and I'm a small person I'm only buckling and I don't weigh that much like I'm pretty small so I took that and I promise you like the rest of the day and then it was just around around like maybe four or five o'clock for the rest of the day like all the way through the night I was like I don't know I felt so tired and I don't think these are supposed to make me feel sleepy but that's just how I react to a lot of things in general like whether it's alcohol and I've never really I've never done weed so I didn't know that this is how I would react but I just got really sleepy you know supposed to get sleepy per say but and it's got really sleepy like it helps you sleep better but that means that like your body will relax it doesn't make you like sleepy it's not a sleep aid so you're supposed to be able to take these any time of day so I got really really sleepy I wanted took a nap and then just the rest of the night I was like really tired and drowsy but the next day I took the regular dose I just took one piece of candy it's like just to help me relax before bed or whatever and I didn't really feel any more tired because of it but it definitely did help with my back pain and it helped me relax so I will definitely say these work like these are like probably one of my new favorite things because it's natural one and it's just it's just a good alternative to taking pain medication all the time and all of that now I do wish the serving size is a bit more because I like eating candy but I just I just probably need to get it in another form other than candy so they told me they have it they have drops that you can put in stuff they have well so they have they have it in other foods they have they have a bunch of options you just have to go to their website and see and then you can use that to make whatever you want and put it in whatever food or you can take it directly under your tongue whatever you wanna do now these in here it says the serving like if we're going based on what the back says it says serving it's four pieces so there's about two servings in here so if we're going based on the front and there's about four to five start rings in here so I think it's that's great these cost 15 dollars that's before shipping and these cost 15 dollars this back and they have variety of products all different prices if I if you're saying like I can get like maybe five pieces out of this that's pretty good that's actually pretty good and I would definitely get this again I'm probably going to get this again because like I said I do have back issues like I'm spine and stuff and so it did actually help with that a lot I recently got a desktop computer so the flora would often work off my laptop and so I got my desktop and so a lot of times I have to use it because a storage is better and all of that I have to use it sitting at my desk and that is always been an issue for me for years and years and years because I've you know even in high school I was home-schooled and so working at home you know doing my schoolwork I'd have to sit up and then at my desk and all of that it just always been an issue because my back hurts so I prefer to work from my bed if I have to do like you know stuff on my laptop or whatever because it's more comfortable and I can prop up a pillow and all that but yeah so sitting at my desk often time really hurts my back and I don't enjoy it at all like I will do everything I can so that I don't have to work at my desk because it's not the most enjoyable for me but this definitely helps I don't know if I should be taking it every day so I'm not gonna do that but I think it's safe like to you know do it every day it's not gonna be addictive or anything like that but yeah I'm probably gonna use it again and I would suggest that you guys check them out gonna link your website in my description box this is like a really cool product that very happy I was introduced to so make sure you check it out if you have not already make sure you subscribe to my channel and also in the comments let me know have you ever tried CBD not weed not just not weed if you've smoked weed that's great for you but like if you've ever tried CBD by itself let me know and let me know if it works for you and do not forget to check them out alright I will see you guys in my next video bye [Music]", "ARVSswHjBDY": "you want gummy bears I got gummy bears you want CBD I got CBD you want CBD gummy bears I got CBD gummy bears what's up guys at your boy big J coming back at you again today from big Co TV where you watch decide in vain and today as promised I've got gummy bears all right but I've got gummy bears with CBD in them alright and they are amazing I've been using these two weeks ish I mean I've been using CBD on and off for quite a while alright and it actually works wonders for me for a lot of different things but we'll go into that in a minute these things they taste good they work well and it's an easy form for you to take your CBD that's what that's all I can say if you haven't tried CBD you truly need to try alright it's not a gimmick it's not you know you see all these wonder drugs if you're one of those people like me that don't like to go to the doctor you don't like to take the prescription stuff you're not a big fan of over-the-counter of this over-the-counter that and you just want something natural to help ease what you got going on try these alright just trust me and try these so without further ado let's go ahead and check out the bottle alright so here you go we've got the Big Daddy pack of CBD FX gummy bears as you can see CBD FX help gummy bears the 60 count oh yeah the Big Daddy does contain full spectrum CBD they are gluten-free non-gmo and vegan all right which is cool you got a you know there's a lot of vegan folks out there these days a lot of people that can't do Blut inand all that stuff you can still have these alright you can still have these that's cool trust me it's cool ingredients organic cane sugar organic tapioca syrup water organic seaweed extract natural flavors and colors organically grown CBD rich hemp oil gummy bears contain no corn syrup no animal gelatin no artificial sweeteners which leads to guilt-free indulging never tasted better very true these are delicious the statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose treat or cure any disease always consult with your physician before use underage sale prohibited that's what I was talking about earlier the FDA hasn't said you know the FDA of course being the FDA says that you can't make claims you can't do this you can't do that about CBD because they haven't studied it so all I'm going to tell you about is my own personal experiences with these but we'll get to that again cannabidiol CBD is CBD FX is naturally occurring in the industrial hemp plant and legally imported and produced very important it is legally imported and produced CBD FX does not sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the u.s. Controlled Substances Act the USCS a hashtag feel the difference will roll around a little more supplement facts a serving size is two gummy bears so basically there are 30 servings in here 16 calories per serving so that's 16 calories for two gummy bears no fat 3.6 grams of carbs 2 grams of sugar 20 milligrams okay of hemp per serving and 10 milligrams of CBD per sir roll it around again and bang we're back to the front now for my favorite part I'm gonna go over some facts and eat a couple of these alright guys so as promised here it is got my facts sheet now just so I can make sure I'm telling you the right stuff so on the bottle you saw the CBD is legal that is used inside this product you may have looked and went well why is CBD legal you know I've heard the CBD isn't legal done it up let me go over that okay our products are exempt okay meaning CBD FX's products are exempt from the CSA and DEA s drug scheduling practices which classify whole half extracts as schedule one drugs because extracts from the stocks of European grown hemp are explicitly exempt from this scheduling practice and that is where the hemp is grown that these guys use to extract the CBD it is grown the biomass is over in Europe their product does meet the standards of the 2014 farm bills definition of compliant hemp which means it has to contain less than 0.3% of THC in the gamete or in the product period in the CBD oil period and again they only use CBD that is derived from a European biomass so that's how it's legal it is also non psychoactive and non psychoactive hemp was deemed legal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 so there are your working facts now let me tell you a couple other things that are also some facts these things are freakin delicious alright the red they're my favorite color alright they taste like a fruit punch slash cherry I mean they're delicious so pop the cap you're gonna have a little safety seal I just normally yeah I just shut my thumb through here they gave me a couple bottles of these but I figured to show you your fresh bottle so pop it open and really they are little gummy bears I mean they look just like gummy bears and they basically tastes just like gummy bears except with a little pop so there you go it really is just a little gummy but I mean you know what I love these things so now that the FDA which you can and what you can't say let me roll that around so you get a nice glamour shot there since the FDA has determined what you can and can't say I'm just gonna tell you some personal experiences for me again I've been using CBD on and off three years what it does for me and in particular the CBD F FX products what they have done for me I used to be the guy that goes to bed let's say 10 o'clock at midnight I'm still up why cuz my brain won't stop okay it won't turn off I'm just going going going going going sit there flip through social media think about work think about this think about that couldn't shut my mind off I popped two of these half hour hour before bed I'm out and when I'm out I mean I am out don't wake up in the middle of the night no tossing no turning just everything just shuts down that's nice alright that's what I use it for also I work in a warehouse during the day yes that's right I am NOT the YouTube famous you know YouTube superstar I have a day job um and a work at a warehouse I do a lot of walking around you know up ladders down ladders all kinds crap I come home I am sore alright pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away okay after a workout at the gym pop a couple of these takes the aches and pains away I mean it's not it's not a super drug but it takes the edge off for me okay other people you know say they use it for anxiety and stuff like that I don't really know if I have anxiety but I will say when I do take them it puts me in a just a nice mellow mood but it's not anything that you that you aren't functional you know I mean I could eat these in the morning before I go to work put in eight hours all day and still be totally fine doesn't make me drowsy even though it does help me fall asleep but the reason that helps me fall asleep like I says it just helps me turn my mind off so that being said I highly suggest you try something like I said if you're like me you don't like all the over-the-counter crap you think a lot of stuff that the doctors give is just you know blah blah mumbo-jumbo because they want you know Big Pharma wants to show some pills down your throat try these all right just try them what's the worst that's gonna happen it doesn't work for you okay sorry you know but I'm telling you most of the people that I talk to they've tried this it works for once you find out how many you actually need okay just because it says take two too might not work for you you might need four you might need six okay try it don't just write it off if it doesn't work the first time okay trust me just give me a favor

your door try a couple gummy bears you know take the edge off guys just take the edge off all right so until next time it is your boy big J for VAP Co TV where you watch the side of a pan I am power [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "dFp1fTRlKtk": "what's up panda nation peter von panda here hey something you may not know about me is I love gummy bears love squishy chewy delicious these are the Haribo called gold gummy bears I'll put a link to in the description if you want to pick these up but one thing that I'm distressed about in the gummy bear world are the albanese candy sugar-free is sorted through gummy bears particularly the 5 pound bag available on amazon.com check it out I'll put a link to in the description but obviously some of you probably know that many of the reviews have been very critical of the Albanese gummy bears and I would just stop you know I'm deeply pained by it deeply pained and I want to read to you some of these descriptions in all seriousness and we're going to treat it with the reverence that it deserves because they can be disturbing and I'm going to get through it and we're going to we're going to be serious throughout the whole thing because obviously this is a heavy heavy subject so let me just start by reading you you know 390 reviews on these gummy bears and I think though the reviews speak for themselves oh man words cannot express what happened to me doctor genius the gummy bear cleanse you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute enjoy if you are like the dozens of people that tried my order run first of all for the taste I would read these a five so good soft true to taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety I was a happy camper but or should I say bought dutt not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose i gastrointestinal experienced oops like nothing I've ever imagined cramps sweating bloating yawn my worst nightmare I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was all like Schiphol apart compared to what's going on inside then game odd the flatulence heavens to Murgatroid the sounds like trumpets calling the demons back to hell the stench like a thousand rotted corpses vomited I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear succumbing to my own boogers but wait there's more what came out of me bubbling so wonder I don't want old Niagara Falls through a coffee straw I swear my fingers were screaming it felt like delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste 100% was aquitted flammable liquid napalm it was actually a bit humorous for a nanosecond as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible and it went on for hours I felt violated what it was over which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day there was still Tommy out of me that I ate a my wedding in 2005 high five pounds of these innocent-looking delicious tasty Albers so I told her friends about what definitely enema dig it had to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands silly woman the horrendous sounds a demon screaming your gut is like an alarm clock without the snooze button do not lollygag when you hear them chant you just run and this should go without saying under no circumstances trust it apart I cannot stress that last part I hope you need my warnings and prepare properly treat this as if it were a blizzard and stocked up on TP so there you have it check out the Albanese candy sugar-free assorted fruit gummi bears five pound bag you're going to want to pick them up there good for you these are good too Peter Miranda out", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "Aa2NwPvyInc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF key operating officer of honey stick as well as Gold Line CBD and in today's tutorial episode we are gonna be calling it CBD gummies for dummies why not because we're insulting anybody's intelligence but because we are gonna break down in a very simple fashion of exactly what the differences are between the different types of gummies available in the market one of the most common questions that we get to our Gold Line customer support is what I hear things like full-spectrum isolate coated infused gummies what's the difference what effect does that have on me and our CBD there's all these gummies out there and no real explanation on what the difference is they cost different they have milligrams so this episode is gonna break down the main categories and differences for gummies what does that mean for your CBD in a very simple to understand fashion and how does that affect your buying of your CBD your supplements whatever so basically we have a few major categories for CBD now a lot of the products you'll see out here if you're familiar Gold Line you will see from our website some of them are not offered on the website but they are prevalent in the market so I think it's important to have them out here so we can have a full discussion even outside of the things that our company is currently offering so you're properly educated on CBD so let's jump into it right away what are the major differences between gummies were the most common questions that I get is what is the difference between isolate gummies and full-spectrum gummies and it's really simple it's what type of CBD DEET is being used isolate gummies are generally made from biomass and it is synthesized off of different hemp products and the CBD is processed and extrapolated until it becomes basically a hundred percent pure a beedi and it's in almost a crystallized form and it's really easy to calculate it's very easy to make different solutions for your gummies it's a very good effective way to know how many milligrams you're gonna get and to make sure that there is absolutely zero THC within your gummies so for people who might necessarily get drug tested or not want to roll the dice on having even any traces of THC within their gummies or their CBD products that they're taking I select gummies are gonna be the way to go so when you're buying CBDs and you're asking your manufacturer like us questions then you would ask whether they have isolates or their full spectrum now what is full spectrum full spectrum is basically gonna have traces of THC however it's still gonna be below the legal limit which is 0.3% for hemp according to the US farm bill now that 0.3% is even below 1% so it is extremely small portion of THC however some people don't want any instead of being processed over the the full spectrum is actually taken from you know basically the live plants so generally when I select gummies are very high in CBD full spectrum and broad spectrum you know made based gummies that use that type of CBD they will have other things like CBN CBG CBC and different spectrums within the CBD category to give you a very complete form of all the different type of CBDs so let's say that you know full spectrum is more like a multivitamin if we're comparing the two different types of CBDs so our CBD is just specific you are getting your CBD and that's that so some people prefer the full and the broad spectrum for that reason and other people prefer the isolates because they don't want to roll the dice they just want to know exactly what they're getting and you are still getting the good effects the supplemental effects of CBD we won't go into what the different effects are people using gummies for different conditions or whatnot or CBD that's on you guys to research I'm not dr. Gupta I can give you medical advice or supplemental health advice but the differences are is full spectrum and isolate based the next large difference is is where the gummies are infused or whether they are coated some people use these terms not properly because they think that if it's infused with CBD that it is just CBD is on there so there's two ways of getting CBD within the gummies you can either coat them or you can actually infuse them to where it's like I like to compare to donut so I mean who doesn't love donuts coated gummy is like a glazed doughnut sort of flavoring and stuff it's put on the top and that's how those gummies are made is that they're made and they are basically sprayed or soaked with the CBD solutions and they get absorbed into the gummy and they're on the outside to infuse gummies they're more like a jelly doughnut to where the solution is on the inside the oil is on the inside and they've been either injected or it's been formulated into the actual compound of manufacturing the gelatin or the building block of the gummies so that is another key difference and between that people say were some of pluses and minuses pluses and minuses are as generally the ones that are coded on the outside those are generally less expensive so they're more budget-friendly however the ones are injected are usually a little bit more consistent so if you're buying a jar of 1500 milligram coated gummies some gummies might be a little bit stronger than the other depending on how they record or if they're touching the edges of the jar and some of the CBD mighta came off and beyond the jar so you might have to take one two more of the coded gummies - whereas some of them might be a little bit stronger so they kind of average out but if you're looking for super consistency then you want the infused got me the jelly donut because that is basically an exact amount that they put into the gummy so now with these examples let's go into you know what different types of gummies there are so outside of the full spectrum and isolate gummies and the coated and infused gummies now you have gummies in the categories of even flavoring so here we have our CBD Gold Line let's take a look at this half of the product line right here so here is basically our offering of CBD Gold Line now these are actually all isolate based gummies so these will have absolutely no traces of THC they have they have basically a total amount of milligrams that you will get per jar and we recommend that you take two to three gummies per serving so we have different textures for gummies our first one here is going to be our sour gummy which is going to be like I said these ones are an isolate based so they're gonna be the zero TAC you're gonna go ahead and open it here so these are gonna be like sour flavored gummies and they are coated with our Goldline CBD solution very clean job of openness let's get close-ups here you get several different colors and these are gonna be more sour and taste you're also gonna have a little outside sugar coating for a little bit of a little bit of extra flavor let's go ahead and take one out and get a real nice close-up if you're into the sour taste not just kind of a plain fruity taste this will definitely be up your Avenue and also sometimes the sour taste can offset any taste within to come with the CBD oils so even when you're dealing with full spectrum gummies and things like that if you have a sour bass gummy it can offset any type of you say I don't like the taste of natural CBD oil there's CBD solutions then a sour gummy might be or a sugar-coated gummy might be a good alternative for you to offset some of that taste so you get a more pleasant experience of Wired having your CBD then you have your natural gummy which is basically plain fruity flavor a lot of companies just in making gummies that aren't CBD infused make very similar gummies that your the taste will be familiar from any of the Albanese gummies and things that you can get from the supermarket except they have the added CBD and these have been coated not infused and they use isolates they have zero THC every once a while different isolate gummies have different solutions every once in a while you might get some type of you might think it's sugar it's crystal but actually the CBD isolates come in the form of CBD crystals so every once awhile it might not be uncommon to see crystals on the gummies it might not have gotten fully absorbed into the gummy or that might be on the outside when the CBDs are a hundred percent pure that they're like isolates it's not uncommon to see some crystals I don't see any on this gummy so everything was good but these are generally big fruity flavored gummies so they're there Jim a little bit more fluffy they have the fruity taste these aren't gonna be the sour gummies so let's go ahead and put this back and move along so on Goldline CBD we generally sell the gummies in two sizes we have a 12 ounce and an 8 ounce and also some smaller assortments generally it's you know more value driven to buy more but we have all the way down to I think 10 or 20 pack that you can buy or even a 5 pack that you can purchase on the website just a sample the gummy to see if you like it and then once you're a go we do all kinds of bundles and you can go up to 12 ounce which contains I think about a hundred and twenty gummies so here we did a limited run for the holiday season these are of our holiday gummies on top of being the large fluffier gummies and being you know of holiday colors which is a red white and green over here these are actually uh flavored also so they're gonna have the different a little bit more added fruity flavor into them so it is a little bit more of a premium gummy than your standard base gummy bears that uh that are used so it's gonna be a little bit of an upgrade but you're not gonna get any of the sour taste so you know what a lot of people and a lot of companies even outside of ours will do is they'll use different types of flavored gummies as their base so you can kind of know what gummy bears from going to the supermarket that you like or what type of tools you like when you're selecting your ideal CBD gummy and I hope it's a gold line but in the event that it's not look for that too when you're on the hunt for buying your gummies let's go a little close-up of these guys so you can see we have the red green and white give me a thumbs up that you got a good focus and other gummies so there you see we have the nicest Ortman they're a little bit fluffier in texture and they also have the added flavor infusion so you're gonna have a very flavorful experience with these holiday gummies and they're still available on our website I think for the whole month of January we continued producing them and once that goes away we'll probably still offer these gummies but they're not going to be holiday oriented maybe some Valentine's Day gummies so now moving right along to our full spectrum gummies these use a high quality of full spectrum oil and on top of that they are actually infused so they are injected into the gummy so each time you get a gummy these that we have here available in four flavors you're gonna get a very consistent 10 milligrams of CBD in each gummy now we used to offer a 25 milligram full spectrum going but a lot of people especially when it comes to full spectrum you can actually taste the CBD oil so taste a little bit more like a medical gummy so there's different things that you have to do to the gummy to offset the taste some people are really into it like the Colorado and California style gummies and that's kind of what it tastes like and some people would rather just have you know a flavorful experience as well so what we did was we realized is that instead of offering a 25 milligram gummy let's kick it down to a 10 so some of the oil taste is not as prevalent and we also have poor flavor so we flavor and fuse the gummies on top of it so let's go ahead and get a close-up of what's available here so we have cherry flavor fruit punch and also strawberry and an orange citrus I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to lay each one of these out here on the table so you can see they're actually fruit shaped and the different flavor is actually indicated by the different color these are really nice gummy very high qualities of very high quality full spectrum oil and they are also quality infused so you have very consistent flavoring taste and CBD oil quantity in between each one of these gummies and again like I said you can get them available in the four different flavors yeah so like we said these will actually be below the point three legal limit for according to the the hemp farm bill passed in 2018 so these are in accordance with that however they might have little traces of THC within the legal hemp limits but they're there is that there is that so people who don't want to roll the dice to get you know drug tested and things like that then generally you want to stick with the isolate based product because there is zero THC in there whatsoever those could be within the legal limits see would be fine and it's still very very small almost non-traceable but we do have to put that out there for you guys then there's also gummies that we're developing that are almost like gushers to where there are very soft and heavily infused with flavor so it's kind of like they melt in your mouth and then they have the the the flavor follows up afterwards and rolls them so it's different from kind of a chewable gummy this is this is an extremely soft chew if we could even classify that but I would say it to a gusher and we have them infused I just want to go ahead and show these because some companies I've seen are doing it we're gonna start offering it but we have not yet so these are in the shape of bear but they're extremely soft very fluffy and almost melts I even feel bad putting them putting them out here but they are and they are actually they're full-spectrum and they're infused we have some of these samples are 25 milligrams all the way down to 10 but you can see that these are more than fusion style soft to customized gummies tour these these gummy bases are actually custom made to really melt so these ones are gonna be more like a gusher and generally you can tell from how fluffy and how soft they look and if you get a real good close-up there you can you can see the difference between that and even a fluffy standard gummy you know so again those would be full-spectrum and infused and then for those people who are looking for positive hemp benefits possibly a multivitamin I've also seen we don't currently offer them but hemp will extract gummy chews that you can see here these actually have hemp oil they're CBD content isn't really confirmed but it does have 20 milligrams of a hemp extract and it's also infused with like a multivitamin tour it has like your vaults a mitten or a vitamin b-complex and also your vitamin C's and different vitamin E so if you're just looking for like a nutritional supplement and don't necessarily want CBD we don't offer it but these are starting to get really popular within the hemp community and something you probably will come across most of these because they also have the multivitamin they're not going to be coated they're gonna be infused so they are gonna be very consistent to take on a daily basis you won't each one is gonna be very consistent to the other and again sometimes with the coated stuff some of them might be a little bit strong and others but generally averaged out pretty good so in summary I hope that today's

cup of corn syrup half a cup of melted infused coconut oil 1/2 a teaspoon of gore gum 1/4 cup of kool-aid any flavor and half a teaspoon of citric acid you also need a strainer that things spatulas molds and also a fan spray get a bowl of ice-cold water you need 1 cup of sugar 1/2 a cup of corn syrup and 1/2 a cup of water and this will be for later to make the gelatin you'll just need 1/2 a cup of water you will add in the 4 packets of gelatin so the full box [Music] make sure to stir everything thoroughly and then we'll just set it to the side until we need it later now you're gonna put your quarter cup of kool-aid or you can use water in the microwave for one minute [Music] now I'm going to get my jello and my kool-aid that I got out of microwave and pour it into a double boiler you're gonna stir until the jello dissolves on medium heat once it's all melted together then you're going to add your 1/4 cup of corn syrup again you're just gonna stir until it all mixes together you're then going to add in your half a teaspoon of citric acid and then mix that together until that dissolves [Music] now once the gelatin is squishy and firm you're going to add that into the mix [Music] you want to break it up into little pieces just so that way it dissolves a bit quicker stir until everything is melted and make sure the water from the double boiler is not boiling you do not want to burn the jello once everything is melted you're gonna put your half cup of infused coconut oil you want to mix that thoroughly now you're going to get your Gore gum and a strainer if your mix looks like this it's because everything is not mixed thoroughly so you'll want to get a whisk and now help everything just mix faster and more evenly now you're going to add in the gore gum and what the gore gum does is an emulsifier that allows the coconut oil and the water to mix evenly so you want to add that onto the top and then mix it until it all dissolves once that's done you're just gonna put the heat on low and then put it to the side while we work on the candy syrup side you'll need another pot you want to get a ziplock bag and a pan spray let's pray the Pam inside the bag and this is so that way the gummies the mixture does not get stuck inside the bag you also want to get your molds ready and also put some Pam spray on that as well turn on the stove to medium heat you're then going to add your one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and your half a cup of water you're gonna want to mix this thoroughly until you see that the sugar has all dissolved [Music] now once you've seen that the sugar has dissolved you're gonna turn the medium up to medium-high then you're just gonna continue stirring until it starts boiling Wow that's boiling you want to make sure you stir your jell-o gelatin side periodically so it doesn't thicken as you can see it's starting to boil and you want to make sure again that you just scrape the sides of it so the sugar does not get stuck once the candy syrup starts boiling you want to make sure it reaches a temperature of 260 degrees now that has reached 260 degrees you're gonna take your pot turn off your stove and just immerse it into the cold water until it reaches 240 degrees once it's reached 240 degrees you want to place it onto a cold surface not onto the place that we were boiling on so that way you can cool down a bit and then you're gonna add in your jello mix into the candy syrup [Music] mix everything thoroughly until it's all one color and you see no bubbles let's sit for about five to 10 minutes until cool so that way you can pour them into the mold then grab your ziploc bag cut a hole in the bottom corner also grab a bowl and this will be so it's easier for you to pour in your jello mixture pour the jello mix inside the bag and then grab a spatula to get everything out I [Music] personally like this method better just because it's easier and less messy then you know refund refilling those syringe or squeeze bottles as you can see there's a little white in my jello mix that just means that I do not mix it long enough so it can be mixed evenly so again you want to make sure it's all one color no bubbles and you don't see any white in your jello mix just so that way you can get the best results these are still gonna taste good but just so that way you know you can get the best results for these gummies mix everything thoroughly a hundred percent [Music] now that I have everything in the molds we're gonna put this in the fridge for about an hour and a half after an hour and a half you will then be placing them in the freezer for about an hour an hour and a half again now for the sugar sour mix it's one cup of sugar and half a teaspoon of citric acid pour your sugar in the bowl then if you want them a little bit more sour then put a little bit more than the half teaspoon of citric acid and then you're just gonna mix it up until you have a nice even sugar sour mix once you try out the mix if it's not sour enough just add a little bit of citric acid at a time just so that way you don't get an overpowering sour taste get some parchment paper so we can place the gummies on now you want to get one tray of the modes at a time when you take them out the freezer so that way it can be an easier faster process taking them out and then sugarcoating them you can either do one at a time or you can do multiple I do multiple just because it's faster just make sure you place them separate from each other so that way they don't stick together and then all you do is shake it up and then you have a evenly coated gummy and then you'll just want to continue this with all of your gummies [Music] these molds I actually got from Amazon I searched up weed molds and as you can see they have these nice emojis on them the other ones have these weed leaf plants on them so they look pretty cool if you want to check them out I can link them down below in the description just so that way you can find them easier and you actually get a pack of six with a little syringe as well so it's a really really great deal so my phone actually died after this part is like cut I coated them I cut them up and as you can see there's nice little squares and I actually ran out of molds and I use an ice tray so I use these heart-shaped ice trays so if you don't have any candy molds you can use some ice trays just make sure you coat them with Pam's so that way they don't get stuck and it's easier to push out [Music] so now that I'm done coding everything this is the last part the hearts this is how they look up close they look delicious and they taste delicious too now I'm just going to be placing my gummies into my bags so with the emoji ones I put six in in a bag these square ones I put seven to eight in a bag and the heart one since they're bigger I put four in a bag and this is how they look so I'm gonna continue doing them with all the other ones and I'm just gonna fast forward [Music] now that I'm all done this is how they all look like in their banks and then I just store them in the freezer until they're ready to eat so I hope you guys enjoy this video if so give it a thumbs up let me know what you think in the comments and also subscribe to my channel thank you guys [Music]", "OnmUvQFoJWE": "hi everyone so I'm going to be doing a review of the green apple medicated hard candies from cannabis no I'll just take the whole it's a hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "iMEewtsktT0": "hello everyone I'm John this is sure right and this is everyday food reviews today we have very excited about this or one of those is very we stumbled across a new energy drink in tea nutrition in Liverpool it's by commonly called Rennsport reps Awards I believe it's American yeah called Ray's energy now we came across this last week yes sir last week and we we did try sorry we didn't show you but we did try a frosted Frost watermelon flavor watermelon Frost I think it's watermelon for us and then we saw this flavor which is sour gummy worms now for those who don't know Sean Sean is a very big fan of the sour gummy worm sweets I'm a big fan so or anything pretty much yeah yeah I think you touched in previous videos that you really like the rock star super sours and stuff like that yeah the bubble bursts the other day so raised energy this is 300 milligrams of caffeine in the whole town there's no beat it's got BCA amino acids no sugar and as they say on the can't no crash so we're pretty confident this is completely directed towards the fitness market as well as being found in tea nutrition yeah and it's it's made by a supplement company young rap sports I've never had any any supplements or pre workouts from them before yeah but yes it's definitely formulated more like a pre-workout than an energy drink to the point where they went when when they say 300 milligrams of caffeine they're using to chemically different forms of caffeine they use in caffeine anhydrous which is the normal caffeine that you'll find in most energy drinks which is just essentially pure caffeine nice to your upper inner yeah so and they're also using Fein citrate which from what I've read online it's quicker it gets into your bloodstream quicker than caffeine anhydrous because it's say oh sorry that's the one to give you the initial boost and the other one is to prolong yeah I mean I think the idea is that if the caffeine gets into your system quicker and you saw you saw got a caffeine citrate which is like a salts of caffeine and sort of getting in there quicker and then the sort of normal caffeine or sort of level out that crash that you'd normally get if you have a lot of it hitting you at once and a normal pre-workout yeah well like some pre workouts not not all of them actually even have different types of caffeine yeah I think the the only one off the top mad is that rich Piana one that I can't remember what he calls it that it's got like five different forms of caffeine oh boy yeah tea nutrition you see it was my girlfriend who went to buy this one for us after we tried the watermelon one they told her in the shop that the caffeine citrate apps slower than the caffeine anhydrous so that would so you've got the normal caffeine getting in and then the caffeine citrate getting in slower and leveling out the crush which I think in terms of having no crush that actually makes more sense that that's how it be or from what I've read online it actually acts quicker than normal caffeine so it'd be the normal caffeine the sort of levels of the crash also worth noting is when it says 300 milligrams it's got 150 milligrams of each and the caffeine citrate is actually only about 50% caffeine by weight which means 50% of that hundred and 50 milligrams that's caffeine citrate isn't actually caffeine so if you comparing this to just a normal energy drink to the best of my understanding because it's not completely transparent how though their way in the caffeine book to the best of my understanding this actually will only have two hundred and twenty five milligrams of actual caffeine so they come then it's a textured camp it's not price marked well we know paid to pound fifty two pound fifty Lucca which is something from America is very good yeah it's not bad at all right well should we open it up and see what it's like yeah definitely so with what I said a second ago about to only having two hundred and twenty-five milligrams that's still more than any other energy drink you'll see in any news agents or anything and it is even even so it's twenty-five milligrams more than leaves the rock star when we did not so long ago yeah exactly and that's like the the highest one you'll see in the show also it's a slightly smaller can so per hundred mil it's gonna be an even higher concentration than that so it's a sixth American 16 ounce can four hundred and seventy three mil so whatever 27 mil is worth yeah Cheers so it's clear it was clear smells like sprite yeah that's I was thinking about what it okay yeah smells like sprite zero not getting much sour he does taste a lot like sprite mmm it's I think it is a bit sharper than sprite it's not it's not sour sour but it is sort of more sour than sprite does taste a bit like sweets though yeah it's got a more sort of candied taste yeah but you something you looks back when it's you know the flavor is named after for sweets yeah if I wouldn't say it tastes like sour gummy worms what I would say is if if coca-cola made a sprite flavored sweet ass our sprite you know why you get those sour Cola bottles if you made sour Cola bottles but so a sprite flavour and then made a drink that was sour sprite Cola bottle flavor yeah that's what that's like yeah now when we tried be watermelon frost flavor the other week it was wasn't long after I'd actually finished a 10-hour shift from 6:00 in the morning and wasn't at my peak performance levels we could say not long after drinking even half a cannabis I was back ambolyn I think that was that's quite fair to say in it mm-hmm this flavor is really nice yes when I smelt it me tastes like sprite when I tasted it I thought that tastes like kind of like sprite I thought that's a bit of a disappointment but I've been a couple more sips of it yeah and into it another if if sprite tasted more like this I'd drink sprite a lot more often it's so it's really nice yeah I think this would be maybe not every day but a very nice alternative like maybe once or twice a week to replace a pre-workout mm-hmm maybe very nice one makers sometimes unless you switch it up your pre-workout route to you every day you know where you've got two or three on the go and open you can get pretty or in currently sometimes and I know you obviously lose that that kick I know we've had we believe in switching a lot don't we because we feel like we get a better return from our workouts if we change pre-workouts yeah every so many days instead of having the same one every day you don't get that so we feel like we lose that balls don't work because you just get used to the amount of caffeine in it yeah so so I'm still a nice carbonated drink like that or lightly carbonated yeah so in assert something worth noting is it's not a heavily carbonated it is clear quite smooth it would be actually a nice alternative if you did yeah if you would do if you're working out everyday money to broaden you would you know Tuesday on a Thursday I think like in between a week pre-workout depending on what your routine is then I think that would be really good mmm I think the one more thing worth noticing before we record worth noting before we wrap it up there's this this can is has a matte finish on it apart from these textured pieces here which are a bit more glossy but having the the contrast it feels nice in your hands so if you're gonna feels like a grip yeah if you grab this from the fridge and walk to work the matte part so they can feel nice and the textured parts are nice and tactile it's just quite pleasing I feel quite happy called in Isis it's nicer than what if you get a normal kind of coke or something from the fridge and it's covered in condensation is slipping out your fingers when you're trying to walk to work or what up here it's it's just a bit more pleasing to hold I think for whatever does with I'll probably get some of them and keep them in the fridge yeah very impressed with raise the raise energy from wrap sports like we said if you are if you do exercise a lot i 100% recommend switching pretty workout routine occasionally and having one of these or even if you just have in a really bad grubby day yeah Oakey Oaks definitely something you it'll pick you up as I found after a work the shift just just the other week so yeah I probably wouldn't recommend having it so late in the day no of it after a late night absolutely yeah yeah okay yeah you've said everything you want to say you're impressed with that yeah okay well thanks very much for joining us guys and we'll see you next time yes", "gRahhO7E9Rg": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah B and welcome to the haze today we were gonna be doing an edible review BAM the standard this guy is the hybrid Andrea this guy is

But how does it actually works and what is the effect on your body and more importantly, your brain? Lysergic acid diethylamide was first synthesised in 1938 from the fungus that grew on rye. In 1943, the inventor Albert Hofmann accidentally touched some to his mouth, got high and became the first person in the world to learn about psychedelic properties of LSD. Research on the drug took place in the 50s and 60s, but as recreational use  began to spread, psychedelic drugs were made an illegal Schedule I drug in the US and research programs were haulted. While other drugs are dosed in grams, a single dose of LSD is measured in one 100,000th of a gram, which is one 10th the mass of a grain of sand. LSD affects multiple brain receptors such as the dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, and glutamate receptors. But most research is on the stimulatory serotonin receptor 5H2TA LSD hits the receptor at an unexpected angle causing it to fold over the LSD creating a lid. The LSD is then trapped which makes this receptor continually fire, causing you to hallucinate. Your body responds by sucking the 5TH2A receptor into the cell in order to degrade the LSD, but this can take up to 12+ hours to happen which is why the high can last so long. Recently, LSD research has seen a revival and using contemporary neural imaging techniques, researchers found that the drug causes parts of your brain to communicate in unique ways, especially in the visual cortex potentially explaining the vivid and complex hallucinations There's also decreased blood flow in the default mode network, correlating to strong changes in consciousness, characterized as ego-dissolution, described as a feeling where the boundary that separates you from the rest of the world dissolves. Many people report this feeling brings a sense of reconnection with themselves, others, and the natural world. In fact, a study on 20 healthy volunteers receiving 75 micrograms of LSD saw that 2 weeks after being dosed, they scored higher for the traits of optimism and openness, with increased creativity and imagination. This has lead researchers to consider LSD as a therapy for patients with death anxiety and life-threatening illnesses. Researchers found that 12 months after treatment, patients reported a reduction in anxiety and rise in quality of life, as the drug helped them restructure their habits and worldview. It is also why the trend of microdosing is emerging, where a person takes one 10th of a recreational dose of LSD, attempting to skip the hallucinations and instead experience heightened alertness, energy, and creativity. Although LSD is non-addictive and researchers rate it as significantly less dangerous than other drugs like cocaine and heroine, there's still an extreme lack of scientific studies to the explain the widespread microdosing trend and even experienced hallucinogen users sometimes experience bad trips producing irrational fears, paranoia, and panic attacks. LSD can also cause flashbacks, where months after the drug has worn off, it can feel as though you're experiencing the effects of the high all over again. In some extreme occasions, people have developed Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, which is like a never-ending trip. Thinking that LSD can lead to psychosis and the risk of suicide are overstated. The 14% of participants in the US national survey who had done psychedelics in the life had no increased risk of developing psychosis, depression, or suicide attempts, but the new research around LSD's potential positive effects is also very young.

alley Makua Wii video I will post it in the description box below if you want to see how she did it I had watched her video a few weeks ago and was just kind of blown away by the food she was eating and then still able to lose weight so I wanted to go ahead and try my own version of it I did week one a few weeks back and then just kind of got off track and was doing other stuff and didn't do week two right after I did week two this last week and I'm gonna do week 3 next week but if you haven't seen my week 1 video I'll put it in the cards above the results were very different than it was in this video and the the foods I was eating were they were the same in that my main meal was the same but the desserts I was eating was different this last week as well so definitely check that one out but what I'll do is I'll go ahead and show you each day what I was eating and I'm not gonna do daily weigh-ins I'm just gonna show you my beginning weight and then my ending weight and i will total up the weight loss for the week so without further ado i'll go ahead and show you my first weigh-in and first day of eating day 1 so i'm having a hard time today i'm gonna go ahead and have this snack pack it's a sugar-free jell-o zero carbs i think it's like 5 or 0 calories but i'll have this to kind of hold me over until dinner I did some meal prep yesterday and I have to cut up sausages in here I'm gonna go ahead and heat that up have that for dinner with some mustard ok so this is what I will have for dinner it's two sausages and some mustard I have just this really cheap mustard that I got a grocery outlet it's zero carbs and zero calorie have that and then I'll wait a while to have dessert so I'm gonna have a couple pieces of this strawberry jell-o dessert has a mascarpone cheese in it and a pack of jell-o I believe that's it I made it a few weeks ago and it's a little bit crystallized around the edges but it still tastes really good I took a bite out of one of the pieces but I'm gonna go ahead and have two little squares of that and I think I should be good for the rest of the night so I just had my first piece and now I feel really stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and put this piece back it's really good I wouldn't say it's rich I just needed a little something sweet I might have that later okay so I'm having a hard time waiting the for dinner so I'm gonna have some of these I've had already seven I think I'm gonna call that quiz one carb for nine pieces seventy calories so I didn't have these sugar-free Jolly Ranchers anymore so I went ahead to happy they're really tasty though they have all different flavors super yummy but definitely don't eat to make these okay I have my two meal prep sausages again have some mustard and then I also added some barbecue sauce today this is the G hues Hickory that's the nutrition but I only put it very little bit and I'll use those two sauces and I'll have dessert probably in a little bit but if you haven't tried hot link sausages with barbecue sauce it is amazing so I think for dessert tonight I'm gonna have some of this kind of like strawberry fluff with it which is the mascarpone cheese I think it's half a cup of water and a jello pot I'm gonna have some of this in a bowl and top it with some whipped topping okay so I was really looking forward to dessert but you can only eat about half of this it's just it's very satisfying I don't feel like I need to eat a whole bunch so I'm gonna put this back and have it another time I went ahead and had eight of these sugar-free Finland bears had these yesterday and they didn't seem to affect my weight loss so I'm gonna head and had eight right now because I'm feeling hungry and it's not even close to dinnertime so to try to hold me over till dinner I'm having one of these strawberry lemonade ices I haven't tried this flavor before but it's actually pretty good I thought it'd be really tangy but it's very mild but it's got a good flavor to it I like it only two o'clock but I'm really hungry so I'm gonna go ahead and have one sausage and then the other one I will have a little bit later okay so I'm having my other sausage here I have some barbecue sauce and some mustard same mustard I've been using and same barbecue sauce I've been using but this combo is really good because this is this mustard super tangy and this Hickory barbecue sauce is a little sweet on a spicy it's just all the things that's so good but I'm gonna go ahead and eat this and I might have a little bit of dessert right after we'll see okay so after dinner I'm wanting something sweet but not quite my dessert yet I'm gonna have one of these diet dr. pepper cream sodas for some reason diet soda is just tasting like carbonated water to me so I can't really say how great this tastes occasionally I will get a sip that tastes kind of like vanilla but it's been just tasting like carbonated soda but I think that's just something with my taste buds right now so I'm gonna have one of these just to have something a little sweet and then I'll show you when I have dessert I went ahead the rest of this bag which had probably eight pieces left which is about one carb seventy calories but I was feeling hungry first thing in the morning so I had that feeling hungry it's about 12:00 I'm gonna go ahead and put in the freezer let's diet dr. pepper cream soda and hopefully that will hold me over until the afternoon time or dinner okay so it's still a little early for dinner but not by much just by like 30 minutes I went ahead and cut the sausages the middle just to make them a little thinner and then I'll chop them into little pieces and then got my mustard and barbecue sauce just like yesterday and that's what I'll have for dinner so I'm feeling like having something salty but I don't want to have too much of anything so I cut up this pepper jack cheese it is 110 calories for 1 ounce which is an eighth of the block so I cut it in half and then cut each of those pieces and how and I just went ahead and had one of the little squares I didn't do a perfect job cutting you could see that like some of these are a little bit thicker than other but I just can't cut straight so I really feel like having another square but I don't think I can fit it in my calories so I think I'm gonna go ahead and have dessert before I eat something I'm not supposed to I'm gonna have for dessert two of these caramel cup slim-fast keto fat bomb I don't know if I test my ketones with these yet I can't remember but each of them are 90 calories and I'm gonna have two so each is also one met carb eight grams of fat so that should fit into my calories I've been a lot of myself about 400 calories or dessert and since I had that cheese I've had a couple of these I think I will be okay and these are really satisfying so I'm gonna go ahead and have two so it's ten o'clock and I'm feeling hungry I am going to have eight pieces of these gummy bears that'll be about 70 calories it is about two o'clock I'm going to have one of my sausages with some mustard and some Chi Hughes barbecue sauce so I don't really feel like having one of my other sausages but I am gonna have one of these two good yoghurts because if you like something a little bit sweet but not quite my jello they're only 80 calories per cup and they are three total carbs so we'll see if this kind of stops me from losing weight or not but I kind of just felt like it's the last day of my slim down so I figured why not so it's five o'clock I'm gonna have my dessert I'm gonna have two of these you know slim fast fat bombs the caramel cups they're so tasty we have two of these hopefully that's gonna be enough to hold me over for the rest of the night I'm not gonna have cheese today to see if that makes a difference in my weight loss I am just feeling snacky so I am going to have two bags of these smart sweets there are only 80 calories each so I'll still be below my 1154 calories for the day okay so my beginning weight was 137 point two and then you just saw my ending weight was 132 point two I think that is crazy I think I lost a little bit more than that during the five-day egg fast but I was only eating eggs for that so I'm I'm really blown away in my first keto slim down week I was much more strict with it I only had the sausage and mustard and then I only had ghido fluff that I made which was just like cream cheese and jello but this week as you saw I did different variations for dessert and I wasn't quite sure how I was gonna work out but I actually lost almost twice as much weight so in the last keto slim down week that I did I lost 2.8 pounds so my 5 pound weight loss this time was almost twice what I lost the first time so I was pretty blown away by that I'm gonna still play with it and definitely do some things different next week but as of right now I'm really happy with my results and I haven't been feeling like I've been deprived or anything but being able to test my ketones for a couple of different dessert variations was very helpful and then also see if I got kicked out of ketosis but I still lose weight and I know I didn't show it but I had tested my ketones for keto fat bombs from [Music] slimfast and also the peach rings I'll have a product review video coming out showing you those ketone tests but even after having the keto fat bombs and two bags of the patrons which even I thought was a bit excessive but I was still able to lose a full pound from yesterday so that's kind of interesting and I'm gonna keep that in mind during this next week and kind of have those desserts as like a fallback for you know there's some variety because it can definitely it can be hard doing the same thing every day eating the same food every day so I want to have some sort of variety and I've been so scared to have any other dessert options while doing this slim down because Ali MacGraw we had such great results and she didn't like venture out at all so it's like a recipe you know all the ingredients and all the measurements are there and I'm too afraid to alter the measurements at all because I think that like just one little tweak is gonna just mess all of it up and then the outcomes not gonna be the same so I had been worried about doing that in week one but week 2 I was wanting to venture out a little bit because I was struggling a little bit more by being able to have different sweets and having that variety really helped so I'm definitely do that next week I'm going to keep my main meals the same as those hot links because I think that fat is really important in the weight loss results that I'm seeing so I'm gonna continue that but definitely keep an eye out for my week 3 video will probably come out in a couple weeks just because I have a week to do it and then I have to edit it and stuff and editing it actually takes a lot of time I know I'm not the greatest editor but even though it doesn't come out that beautifully it still takes a long time to do so anyways with that being said that is all I have for you guys today a please give this video a thumbs up if you liked it I would really appreciate your feedback drop me a comment if you have any questions about what I did this week or anything keto related I will try and help the best that I can but I really just love talking to you guys and talking anything keto related so definitely drop me a comment I'd love to get to know you guys but I will see you guys in the next one bye", "0IIHUYmS4pA": "[Music] we both do the wavy drop lean to the left do the wave eBook wavy book do the wavy drop means the left do the wavy book on camera but it's toxic me people but we've learned today you'll see a video in a minute orbit will lit up and everything proper video and you'll see the guys that we're getting it off basically so it's pretty right I'm just little knackered at the moment because I thought I forgot about doing this as always like busy doing other stuff and basically no we're just doing this is like I'm feeling it follow us free so we've just back with another review top 12 elite pass through oh yeah might as well get it done it was meant to come out today so come out tomorrow well yeah well it is tomorrow now in it so yeah tomorrow so it will be technically today in like technical terms so we've got selector bores and there's two point tip of wax in each one of these so basically these are pretty strong we were speaking about it but we speak I speak so much on messages so I can't really remember what we've done of how my brain just goes on but basically what we're going to do is munch these and let you know the flavor the smell and the buzz and the taste well that's the flavour and basically appearance is well the parents so their parents are these they're wonderful texture they're squidgy for they're not sticky the insights promised to keep that a proper don't see about proper Chinese literally properties and there's not much for all that leaks out on your fingers there's not only you do get a lot of oil comes back out but yeah these should be right so let's try these that's a kick up resin that's nice this one some Apple you can really taste the resin taste that's the after note but linger in and back of the throat the resin definitely get a sour apple get a brilliant strong Apple and the sourness goes in with the resin so it's pretty nice you can taste the resin a lot in this that's what I do you find with gummies well jellies these jellies what we call them gummy personalty the soxhlet don't know if anyone else call some gummies these one here parrots on the inside it's like a darker color and the sender then the outside because there's looks like a powdered sugar or something on the outside something to stop it being so oily and sticky that's both of them down the hatch overall appearance and flavor appearance is wonderful that little noise is looking jelly sweets I've seen in a long time I've had a few that just don't move do you ever think on the tunnel like if I buy it myself and I don't think is good enough it won't go on eternal but if someone like its kind enough to help me out with something I'm going to the review but truthfully tell the truth and it can't just say oh yeah it's amazing what a way for you know gotta tell the truth gotta know a truthful review okay no I mean why is it gonna be a ship in view at the end of the day if you carry on doing the same thing and just go in yes what wonderful was wonderful people's going to buy ship products and people's not going to know about it even the people are not getting rid of it you know that's the way it's gotta be you gotta do stuff properly what I had done a video in ages because something happened I will explain on another video as you could probably see I've got a scar on my head yeah it's not the most nicest thing that happened but we're still carrying on with the YouTube we're still doing stuff and like I said before we're a warrior or a warrior like a proper soldier huh and that's the way it goes me no stopping me the only way I'm going underneath or cremated I don't [ __ ] know what anyone decides after I'm gone that's their decision not mine you know unless I'm [ __ ] making myself but yeah that's another video total different video it it is quite upsetting there will be a lot of graphic pictures and stuff so if you're not home if you got a weak stomach and [ __ ] up and you don't like gory stuff don't look I don't watch the video don't check it out but we just would run belong a little bit just to make the video up as you always do because edible videos they don't really go the longest as the reviews but yeah appearance it gets a 10 out of 10 definitely a 10 out of 10 appearance the flavor I reckon there could be more apple flavoring a little bit more up of flavoring so not too much so I would say for flavor it gets eight 8/2 flavor because the resin overpowers the Apple so much you can't really taste the Apple there is a strong apple taste in between once it starts warming up but it's not that strong because the resin off takes it straight away so it's hard to explain but if you know if I and you tried them then you know that it takes over a little tap it just might be different types of resin has different like flavors don't think so if it's not got flavor in it you to the flavor out and it's just the resin there it's going to be stronger resin content and other plants so it's just all down to preference you know but I give it a 8 for flavor the smell on it it's amazing it's like a really like a pearly smile you've got a sweet sugary smile as well and you couldn't really smell the resin in it at all so no one would really know this but kind of is enough by the smoke as soon as he bit into it it was Noble so it's one of them ones but yeah it's a really nice thing for the smell I can't remember why I said if I said something before but for the smile I would say it gets a 9.5 because only because only because basically like I said with the Apple it'd be nicer to smile more Apple same as the taste nicer to taste more Apple but other than that it's literally a really nice smile taste and appearance in one yeah what we're gonna do is come back in about an hour's time maybe probably just just over our because we've had food it's really but had Artie you never think but it probably digested right now I don't know it's really slowly still digesting so we'll give it about hour and a half to two hours and we'll be back with you guys letting you guys know the buzz how we're feeling and everything like ins and outs of exactly how I feel anyways hope you enjoyed all of the latest videos we haven't got much strain reviews das been coming up now we're just getting back all into everything again we was just like trying to spend a bit of time at the family and try to just do different things and focus myself and it didn't work and well it did so and then I got [ __ ] over by some body you know but yeah basically there's gonna be a lot more reviews coming up now I'm focusing on my youtube focus on me and just shocking it when I Soph so yeah anyways see you guys in about two hours and related to know the bus and how it all goes peace guys say these guys went back and basically left it just a little bit over two hours feeling nice and mellow hi we are in Dublin and Kristen's Pistons we've got lower the different refuse and stuff like that another make you know was in some way tolerance levels are going to be very high at the moment so it's a big a difference if you are a beginner and you've got high tolerance you know but I am feeling quite high time for a beginner you'd be what to help you would be sleeping I nearly and nearly for what lying down I didn't when I stayed awake so that's why it's a little bit labor as you can see the eyes are puffy but my eyes they went [ __ ] they went red for a stage and I hardly get red are so that's when you know this is good material it's strong for me and if you're strong for me it's going to be strong for someone not don't use on every day I use it every day and I mean a lot of cannabis products just to calm down the anxiety etc if you wonder why the headphones on basically I'm playing xbox of normal but the Xbox controller Bobby got me Xbox on a ps4 I used to like this - but ps3 and ps4 [ __ ] up that's death but yeah I'm feeling quite nice and mellow and it's a steady where our first it it started creeping peaked off and now is slowly dropping back down so is it's nice there's no nice feeling but yeah why will recommend is trying some of the jelly sweets definitely you send the sticker anyway I made sure up a lot in the name was on the top of the sticker so you guys see all of that anyway but yeah thanks to the extractor person that gave me this and the person has got all the edibles I try Maroubra I love a size medium this is so they could just lit up but main things is the buzz I would rate it out of 10 personally me I would say Oh a 9.5 again is not 100% at the point that I would like but this is pretty good you know so it gets you on the shoulders it makes you feel a bit like what we had it as I would class you know when you've got different alcohol beverages and you've got different stages when you getting drunk basically this is more of a tipsy instead of being totally pissed or smashed like your face you know it's on the verge of getting to the point of near enough there but a tipsy feeling in stoned version this is a stoned tipsy feeling as I can explain it that's what I like it's bringing it a lack of comfort I like putting it to the equivalent is alcohol because at the end of the day it should be really alcohol kills more people and this doesn't so if it makes people more happy in life why not have it on the shelves and legalize it or decriminalize it will do whatever whatever just have it so we're not getting done for this this plan it's just a plan and loads of people at the moment we're getting done with very stupid remotes so come on please just wake up no one in the government at the moment or really understand it certain people are but these are like saying certain things and then we've kind of dodged them like basically yes or I've seen certain things but doing others is a different situation but this is a really nice edible really nice taste really nice smell appearance and was as you can see if I can hardly speak currently talk so and if you can't really hear me the best is because I'm doing in a different place as you can see so it's in my chest like in the center of my room so I can do the communiques I tried to a few things I need to and I'm still saw a lot

Store-bought gummy bears, although delicious,\ntend to have tons of foreign, unpronounceable ingredients in them. So I want to show you how you can make them\nyourself at home with just four ingredients and all natural sugars. So let\u2019s get started. Being able to bake is so great for a lot of\nreasons. One in particular is that you know and can\ncontrol what goes into your food. My one tip is always is to use quality ingredients. We\u2019re going to start out by preparing our\nfruit for our homemade gummies. So I have some strawberries that have been\ndefrosted. Feel free to use fresh, but when berries are\nout of season, I like to use frozen. Now what we\u2019re going to do with these is\nput them into a food processor and make a puree. We\u2019re just going to puree them until they\u2019re\nnice and fine and there\u2019s no lumps. Next, we\u2019re going to take our puree and\npass it through a sieve. Now we do this step because we want to remove\nseeds and we also want to end up with a nice, smooth strawberry puree at the end. So we have our lovely fruit puree, we\u2019re\ngoing to head over to the stove and combine it with the rest of our ingredients. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add in your strawberry\npuree, water, lemon juice, and honey. And then heat all of these ingredients together\nuntil they just come to a simmer. Now that our mix is simmering, it\u2019s time\nto add in our gelatin. Now if you are vegan or don\u2019t eat gelatin,\nyou can always replace this with agar powder, which you can buy online or at a health food\nshop. Sprinkle your gelatin over the mix and then\nwhisk it in until there\u2019s no more lumps and your mix comes back up to a simmer. Ok perfect. So I\u2019m going to take this off the heat. I can see that there\u2019s no lumps of gelatin. It\u2019s nice and smooth. If you do find lumps of gelatin in yours,\nyou can feel free to pass it through a sieve again to remove those. To make these real, authentic gummy bears,\nI\u2019m going to set mine in this mold I got online. It\u2019s really inexpensive. However, if you don\u2019t have one of these\nmolds, you can always line a tray with cling wrap and this\u2019ll work just as well. You\u2019ll just have to cut our your gummies. I\u2019m going to put a link for this mold along\nwith the recipe for my gummy bears on biggerbolderbaking.com. If you\u2019re using a mold, lay it into a tray\nbefore you start filling it up. Pour your mix into a jug with a small spout\nso it\u2019s easy to pour into the molds. And also, if you see any bubbles floating\non top, just scoop that away with a spoon. Now just very slowly, fill up all of your\nmolds with your gummy mix. If you see any air bubbles, just pop them\nwith your finger. So when I worked as a pastry chef, one of\nmy jobs was to make the sweets for after dinner. And every night, we made pate de fruits, which\nis exactly what this is. It\u2019s kind of like a fruit paste. Ok and that\u2019s them done. So now remember, you don\u2019t just have to\nmake strawberry. You can make any flavor you like. I also made blueberry homemade gummies and\norange flavored homemade gummies. The orange flavor is particularly easy because\nyou just use orange juice instead of a puree. Once you\u2019ve filled your mold, we\u2019re going\nto put our gummy bears in the fridge overnight so they can set. If you like this video, don\u2019t forget to\nsubscribe to my channel so you don\u2019t miss out when I upload a new one. So I made these gummy bears yesterday because\nI wanted them to be nice and set so I could show you. If you\u2019re using a mold, just go very gently\nto ease out your gummy bear. You don\u2019t want to damage him. Just look at this little gummy. He is adorable. And the best thing about it is you made him\nand you know exactly what went into him. It\u2019s all good ingredients. You can create any fruit flavors you like\nso the possibilities are endless. Don\u2019t forget to head over to my website,\nbiggerbolderbaking.com where there is a recipe on how you can make your own sour gummies. Thank you so much for watching and I\u2019ll\nsee you back here next Thursday for more Bigger Bolder Baking.", "vGPBTghmi4k": "so I'm steak inedible before I lay down and it [ __ ] woke me up and I'm blasted right now so look I'm gonna make this video and tell you about the edible that I just ate so I got this free supposedly that's what did it I think the Flav Apple or what is it strawberry I don't even know what it is huh let me go look at the package here but that's what I think I'm you [ __ ] up and look if you haven't already done so you subscribe to the channel cuz you can see a lot of good videos on here including ones that like look at me I can't even open up my eyes right now I'm [ __ ] laid off of that man [ __ ] let let let I can't even open up my eyes look at me my eyes are just like I can't even like lift them all right so look be smart don't like don't use edibles and drive that would be dumb don't do that be smart and don't make the same mistake don't eat an edible before you go to bed because I thought maybe you wanna help me sleep but this must have been a little bit like I'm I agree sativa dominate um right here we go there that's what's got me late don't slag the Flav strawberry and Apple belts I [ __ ] won one I'm live but I also had that - this was a little freebie rice krispie treat from that club that I went to earlier at dispensary here in Temecula California it was king no cannabis castle I was the name of the place king of his castle so I don't think I'm gonna make a very long video I just wanted to kind of go and like and let you know that if you're gonna eat inedible do that maybe before you go I mean like you know way before you go to sleep I mean don't do it like [ __ ] like ten minutes before you go to sleep do it like [ __ ] five hours before you go to sleep it's gonna blast you and you know you're gonna wake up and do y'all high-end [ __ ] like I am right now but I mean other than that the Flav candies are really good mr.

THC cipher so Pittsburgh kid here chilling and man be careful with the edibles if you have any animals before I said this before on the other video start low work your way up and what I mean like don't", "76ZCi1QGZ6s": "how are gummy bears made so I'm rich are tell I'm a professor here in the Department of Food Science also instructor of candy course in the summertime gummy bears start with gelatin and that's that's the basis for it this has sugar corn syrup and water we're boiling it off to 240 degrees down to around 12% 10% water something like that and then we're gonna add gelatin to that and that's gonna be the that's what makes a gummy bear a gummy bear so this is gelatin it comes from pigs or cows hoofs and and skin and things like that basically it's just collagen that's broken down into smaller molecules all that remains for us is to add color and flavor and a little bit of acid this is acid it's a mixture of malok and citric acid just for the flavor so we're gonna add green apple flavors so we chose the appropriate acids to to match that flavor to make the gummy bear shape we start with cornstarch so what we're gonna do is make the gummy bear shape with this press board into the starch and then we're gonna fill those holes with the candy these will dry overnight and actually the starch will pull some of the moisture out of the candy to get to the final moisture content plus the gelatin once it cools will turn into a gel and the end result is a gummy bear so if you put a gummy bear in in a microwave and warm it for 10 seconds it shows one of the interesting properties of gelatin which is its thermo reversible if you warm it back up above this melting point it goes back to being a liquid the gummy bear flows and then when it cools back down again it's it resets but not as a bear just as a puddle so based on a chemical nature of the the gelatin molecule so the end of those protein strands when they when they gel they form this triple triple helix thing as opposed to another tighter type of bond like you I find in starch and pectin and so that when you heat it up those just uncoil and go back into solution and so you go back to being a liquid phase and then when you cool it down again forms that triple Junction zone again and becomes the squishy gummy bear that that we just made", "uVrVyKUO5_c": "[Music] what's up friends welcome back today we have a little bit different video than you guys are used to so instead of giving you guys a exact follow the steps instructions this is gonna be more like you guys come along with me when i experiment so i like to try out different ways um that we can make different treats and a lot of times it turns out sometimes it doesn't um but i kind of just go with the flow and see what will happen i feel like no matter what you can always salvage your treats into something it may not be what you intended it to be but it'll always be delicious so for an example my intentions with this video was to create infused jolly ranchers and for them to be hard candy now that did not work out they ended up being a soft candy so i just kind of went with it and i thought it might be cool for you guys if you want to see my thought process and how i kind of decide to go with things when they go wrong so please let me know if you guys enjoyed this type of video or if you'd rather it be um here is like the guaranteed results from this step-by-step process [Music] all right let's get started here's what you're going to need some jolly ranchers or any hard candy that you enjoy some coconut oil or tincture citric acid and some infused sugar or regular sugar unwrap your jolly ranchers and then separate them into colors that you think would mix well once melted together i'm doing blue and green and the purple and reds now i'm setting up my double boiler and adding in my pink and red jolly ranchers they're mostly pink and i am using a total of 20 jolly ranchers now i'm adding in some lecithin and i'm just using my spatula because it is really hard to get off a spoon and then putting that back in and mixing it up now because i'm just doing a little experiment i decided that chamoy would taste really good with this jolly rancher mix since it's mostly all watermelon so i'm adding in two tablespoons of chamoy and then two tablespoons of infused sugar of course you could use regular sugar or you don't have to use chamoy i mean this is totally very flexible you can kind of flavor this to how you want you can put whatever creation you can come up with in there pretty much now i'm just waiting for this to melt over the double boiler it does take a long time i probably took about a half an hour to get to this point now that it's mostly melted i'm going to add in my coconut oil so i decided to add in three tablespoons there wasn't an exact reason for why i chose this amount it's just kind of like i said an experiment to see how it goes so we're going to mix that in and the oil is pretty tricky to combine with the mixture so i am going to use a whisk and just whisk that up really good just do it for a few minutes and it will come together very nicely and there is no problems getting this to emulsify just be persistent with stirring it until everything is nice and smooth like this so at this point it's pretty much ready to be refrigerated and like i said you guys can add whatever you like so if you want them to be very sour add some citric acid if you want them to have any sort of other flavor you know add it in anything is probably going to be just fine so then i now that this is all mixed together i'm going to pour it into a little dish because this is a smaller amount i'm just using a smaller dish so that i can get them to be thicker instead of very thin if they were spread out along a larger container this container had some grooves so i just filled it with some tinfoil so i could get the bottom to be flat and then place some wax paper inside of there um i had some issues with the wax paper if i was to do this again i would use parchment paper i just didn't have any on hand so then i'm going to pour this mixture into my little lined container and then i'm going to put it in the fridge to set i also just popped the little bubbles with a toothpick and then kind of just dropped it a bit to release any air bubbles um in the end because this turned out to be more like a starburst i didn't need to do that because i could have just squished it or molded it down with my finger okay so here it is after being in the fridge for probably about a half an hour and i was ready to score it because i was wanting these to be hard candy and you need to score these earlier on in the process so i'm just measuring it out and attempting to score it but it doesn't really hold my shape so i put it back in the fridge for another half an hour or so and then took it back out to score again and then i also sprayed my knife with some cooking spray so that it wouldn't stick now it's very malleable like i can reshape it really well and cutting it was fine but this was when i realized that this probably was no longer going to be a hard candy and it was going to be a soft candy so i cut all these shapes and then put them back in the fridge but they were kind of like they kept on molding back together so point being is that it needs to stay in the fridge a lot longer so i put them back in and then worked on making a coating for them so for these i thought they'd be absolutely delicious with a tahini coating so i started with one tablespoon of icing sugar one tablespoon of infused sugar and one tablespoon of tahini and then i tasted that and i felt like it needed more sugar so i added in some more sugar as well as some citric acid to make it more sour and then i tasted it again and it still felt like i wanted it to be quite a bit sweeter so i just added in the rest of my sugar and you guys there's no like exact measurements you just do this to what you think tastes good more sugar less sugar whatever you like and then i'm also going to grind this down in a food processor just to make it a little bit finer to coat my candies and then i poured it back into my container now these have been in the fridge for over an hour and while they were in there i'd go in with my knife and kind of just cut them so you can see they're still very squishy and like a soft candy nothing like a hard candy so that's a texture we're working with here now i'm just peeling them all off of this wax paper and you can see that it's stuck to the back of them quite a bit it was easy for me to get off but if i had used parchment paper there wouldn't have been that issue anyway so if you were to do this use parchment paper and not wax paper and then i separated them all and then put them into my tahin sour sugar coating and shook them all up then i put them back into the container as i was taking them out i could tell that they were very soft so i knew that these weren't going to be the type of gummies that were going to hold or not gummies the soft candies that were going to hold their shape outside of the fridge now that i've made these i've realized that in order to keep them out of the fridge we're going to need to add gelatin so let me know if you guys would like to see me do a recipe like that um but they look so good and of course i had to try one and they were so tasty like the watermelon jolly rancher chewiness with the sour sugary tahin coating and then the chamoy and the watermelon like i don't even know how i can explain how delicious that was but like so good now we're gonna do our batch of blue and greens using our tincture um these take forever to melt oh my goodness so yeah i left them on here for probably like a half an hour and then they finally were melting and make sure you guys are checking on the water in your double boiler i found that my water was going down fast and i constantly had to re-add it so just make sure you have enough water in there all the time okay so now after this has melted quite a bit i'm going to add in my tincture so we're doing one two three tablespoons and then to compensate for the extra liquid we're adding in three tablespoons of sugar i'm just using regular sugar because i don't know why i think i ran out of infused sugar anyways we're mixing that in and now we're going to add in some lecithin and i'm going to use my whisk to get that since we need to whisk this all together to get everything to emulsify so just stir that all up and get it to mix together and then i want these to be really sour because sour blue raspberry green apple like that's a good combination am i right okay so citric acid mix that in i had the candy thermometer in here because i was trying to make hard candy so we had to bring it to a certain temperature to allow that to happen um but in the end i realized it was not going to reach that temperature so i decided these are also going to be soft juice um which means i'm going to also add in some coconut oil so i'm just doing one tablespoon of this i could probably have added more but i just wanted to try using a little bit less since the three in the last recipe was a little bit soft now i'm adding in even more citric acid because i want these to be super sour like i've said before these recipes are extremely flexible if you're just making these for yourself it's not going to hurt if it's not exactly perfect every time if you're making these for other people then that's a different story but it's always fun to experiment um this is my favorite part of making all these treats okay now that we have the coconut oil in there we're mixing that all together and it's coming together very very nicely we just have to keep whisking it to make sure it's all mixed together you can see it looks nice and smooth and now we're pouring it into the same type of system the little container with the wax paper again because i don't have any parchment paper and then i'm putting it in the fridge i had intended to come back for this an hour or so later but it ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple of days because i got too busy to continue with them so now here we are with our refrigerated mixture slab i took it out of the fridge and then i let it sit for about 20 minutes to kind of soften it up so you can obviously tell the fact that it softens up at a warmer temperature means these need to stay in the fridge again it would u uh we would need to use gelatin to make them stay stable at um or to hold their shape at room temperature and if you guys are interested in me doing a video like that let me know this is just an experiment like i said a few times already so anyways so i just cut them up into these little shapes and then i put them in a container with some sugar and a little sprinkle of citric acid shook them up and then i put them back in the fridge so that was all we needed to make both of those and they were so good now let's talk about how they turned out taste wise okay so i'm just eating them while i'm talking so i can explain so first of all don't put them in the freezer because they'll get kind of wet on the outside just keep them in the fridge this green one it's sour green apple and blue raspberry the flavor is literally amazing they go so well together and the sourness is perfect [Music] that is really really good like i really like that it is very soft though it's not as chewy as like a starburst it's much much softer like very like your teeth just like go right into it so i mean maybe if you eat them in the fridge it'd be a little bit chewier but i let mine sit out um so i could see how well they would do i think it's about 24 degrees in my apartment so if the air conditioning was on i probably could get away with keeping them out of the fridge okay now we're going to try the watermelon cherry chun way one so it definitely is mostly watermelon only a little bit of cherry and we can really taste the watermelon chamois which one is really good i think the only thing i would change to the watermelon one is to do more of a sugar coating like i did for the green one um i just kind of want that like really like sour sugar to contrast the sweetness of the watermelon chamois um it is pretty oily but only on your fingers you can't really like taste the oiliness overall i rate the watermelon choi one seven out of ten and then the green one i would literally rate like a nine point five out of ten it was like so so so good i think it's gonna put some citric acid in it as well but both of them are good if i could do anything different aside from the sugar i would also add gelatin so they could be shelf stable but i don't mind keeping in the fridge anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this video please let me know if you did leave a comment below give us a thumbs up and subscribe thank you guys so much for watching i hope you have a wonderful day", "t2Pd-13M20g": "- I'm cosplaying as a gummy bear! (beep) (classical music) All right friends, Halloween is just around the corner and I have some issues with Halloween. First and foremost, a lot of gummy candies, which is like my favorite thing, are not vegan! I still think it's weird that strangers are giving out candy to children. So, (laughs) I wanted to see if I could make my own vegan version of gummy bears at home. Flip It is a series on my\nchannel where I take one thing, and make it into the vegan thing. So I'm going to take gummy bears today, substitute out the gelatin, which is not vegan, and substitute in agar agar, which is. (claps) So let's see if we\ncan make vegan gummy bears. (whirring) (pouring) (mellow electronic music) All right, what is agar agar you may ask? It is a seaweed or an algae. It has a little bit of a taste, but not much, it's very mild. But it acts the same way\ngelatin does, almost 100%. The only real difference is that it doesn't quite get as hard\nas traditional gummy bears, which is fine, they're just gummies that\nare a little bit softer. We are going to naturally sweeten them and also naturally color them. We're going to make a blue-purple color, we're going to make an\norange flavor and color, and we're going to make green ones. And I'm going to use\nspinach to turn it green. I'm going to use an\norange to make it orange; and taste like orange. And I'm going to use\nblueberries to make them purple. If you guys are new here, I'm Candace the Edgy Veg, and you should hit that subscribe button 'cause I make new videos every single Tuesdays and Thursdays. And if you like this series, give this video a big thumbs up 'cause you know it's gonna rock! Also appropriate that this\nis my Halloween video, that I have a new hair color. Oh, if you guys want to know where to get these\nlittle gummy bear molds, and then I not only have gummy bear molds, but also little bears and little robots and little dinosaurs. I'll leave a link to the\nAmazon thing that I used, just in the description box. Well, this comes with a dropper. All right, to make these\nas super, super simple, depending on the flavor\ncombinations that you want, and the color combinations that you want, really the possibilities are endless. What I like to use is just apple juice. It has a pretty neutral flavor. But you can use any sort of\njuice that's your favorite to achieve different flavors. Another think that I am going to do is just color them naturally as well, by blending different ingredients to get the color that I want. So if you want like red, you can use beets. If you want purple, you can use blueberries. So all I'm going to do is\ntake the apple juice... You could also do this if you want cocktail gummy bears. You can do this with wine as well. I've done ros\u00e9 ones, they're so good. But you just wanna blend whatever\nyou're using for the color together with your liquid. So whether it's water, whether it's apple juice, orange juice, wine, blend that together in a blender and add it to a small sauce pan. Bring that liquid to a simmer and add in your agar agar and give it a good whisk. Now you can taste it here\nto see if it's sweet enough. If you want to add extra sweetness, add some agave in there\nuntil it's dissolved. This will also make it\na little bit chewier, making it closer to the texture\nof traditional gummy bears. I find between maple syrup, agave, and regular sugar, the regular sugar sets the most naturally. It does get a little bit chewier than the agave or the maple syrup. I opted out of maple syrup just because you're always\ngoing to have that maple taste. Sugar and agave are a bit more neutral. All right, so I brought these to a simmer and then let them simmer\nwhile stirring constantly for about three minutes. And now I'm going to take\nmy little eye dropper and fill in my bears, my gummy bears. These are like little piggies. I thought they were\npiggies when I bought them, but they're little panda bears, gummy bears and robots. So the green is looking a\nlittle darker than I would like. I would prefer it to be more vibrant. I think you could probably mix in a little bit of spirulina but I just picked something that was more neutral like spinach, spirulina does have a taste. But the cooking and oxidization\ndefinitely made it brown. So I'm just going to take my dropper and then fill in the little molds. (mellow electronic music) All right, so I'm sticking\nthem into the fridge. I popped up a couple just to test them. I have some here, some up here. My freezer's pretty full, so I also stuck some in the fridge, but I'm going to let them set. Now a lot of websites\nsay just 10-15 minutes. I'm gonna leave it for a\ncouple hours and come back. (classical music) All right, I've popped\na couple of them out. Look at that little guy. A little teddy bear. I mean obviously this\nis a tiny little mold, but you can get bigger ones. Like I said before, the texture is different\nthan a gummy bear, it doesn't have that\nsqueaky gummy chewiness, it's a little bit softer. But they're really tasty. I was thinking, if you wanted to do sour versions, you could probably add\nsome Vitamin C powder or citric acid powder, which is just Vitamin C, and then you get that tang.

yeah dude look how clear this oh my god i hate messing it up we starting off with red berry vodka now this was sent to us by one of you guys and you all got a bunch of booze in this for some reason like you're showing off your friends it's mike michael come behind up with some triple sec i don't go too heavy because there's a lot about there's a lot of stuff going in there next we come behind that with some peach schnapps michael using everything talking to him like his dad michael and then he wants us to hit it with a little bit of simple syrup i mean this kind of already gonna be sweet but whatever the heart wants what it wants so i can go with midori first now the beauty of midori or these green liquors is that when you hit them with blue curacao you get a nice cooler grain you see that's always our little secret lemon juice oh yes lemon juice now lemon juice mike what is not in this drink that's all booze basically yeah that is oh my god oh my god i just realized that the hell are you doing son mike i don't think i think he probably needed we're meant to have a little more room for this i think you need to be grounded if you're drinking that every day okay go in your room and don't ever come out when you come out again we'll be in spaceships now i can hit this with a little bit of pineapple orange just gonna add another color scheme up top how does that look now [Music] i like the drink i think it's cool we can put a little orange on the side because it's orange and pineapple you can put a pineapple over here too you see and there you have it ladies and gentlemen the green gummy bear now a white gummy bear that's the popular one everyone knows that would be raspberry vodka which is kind of similar it was meant to be raspberry but we don't have anything okay then there would be peach schnapps sweet and sour which is not here and then sprite so he deviated a lot from we did simple syrup and lemon juice which is kind of sweet kind of kind of close enough yeah okay well i mean yeah sweet and sour ish okay but this this is cool mike however that is a lot of booze and your grades have been slipping so you need to study more drink less you can watch might be a 50 year old man but ha ha son i got grandkids anyway as always drink responsibly don't drink and drive mike i'm just choking my chair you know where you my boy come on you're using all these colorful sugary stuff okay this got diabetes written all over it that's my lane later", "ppi0khS0s_8": "you want to taste this at your gas in it's pretty sour okay oh my god you better water everyone I'm Claire I'm in the v8s kitchen and today I am making gourmet sour patch kids this is not my best category of candy but I like sour okay that this will look like children that makes these more disturbing than I remember well I remember mmm they're good they they just crossed over into being not good it's like person was pretty good second one's pretty good third one would probably still be okay and then a four hundred bad I love the like mouth salivating sour coating it has a very chewy texture the coating I'm 99.9% sure is an extra sugar and citric acid and that's it so there's no flavor in the coating the flavor is the gummy part itself they once oh they're hugging same thing deserve it sighs fire I don't love sour and flaky these are really weird I don't hate it but they don't like it wow this is a big bag I don't know what these are these are watermelon sour patch kids but they're not in the shape of kids they're in the shape of watermelons they're good I wish they were more sour not really sour extreme sour I'm super excited about this I love sour oh wait okay now it's happening oh it's good no no what red is you don't like that I love that oh you are not gonna like the final one then don't have the only flavor than that Oh what are you kidding Delaney oh my god you did the best one the watermelon wrong I read love codes via regular ones you eat a whole bag cut your toe oh yeah like sandpaper example yeah just keep going up it's like a chemical exfoliator here ones last time you had one not that long ago actually so my younger child Cosmo is actually coming to work tomorrow because it's summer and camps are done and he is a sour aficionado he fancies himself like a real sour like he'll eat a whole lime oh wow the most important thing about it is the texture it's right now perfect chewy I know perfect it's very hard say that right now can we just talk by the shape real quick yeah I don't like that they're in the shape of first I mean they're supposed to be the shape children yeah why why are they called sour patch kids there has to be some character what what do you want in the shape of watermelon that's your job all right we're gonna clear this off and I'm gonna take a closer look how I used to carry through this when I worked in a restaurant I always get yelled at so you at least line them closer thank you all right we got some we got a Roy Roy Roy jib you've red orange yellow green blue I'm gonna know that yellow is lemon and orange is orange but green blue and red tick who knows could be it's anyone's guess I have the best idea ever let's trace Cosmo and use his shape I think will be very fun also I don't know how I'm gonna do that I want to taste each of these components separately it's really only sweet there's no sour flavor at all and some vague fruit flavoring I'm gonna taste another crystal coating I can say definitively citric acid and granular sugar that chewy texture I know it's gonna be difficult but there's really just one task everything else is just kind of assembly and is not so challenging time for my favorite part reading the ingredients sugar shocked invert sugar corn syrup modified corn starch are Taric acid citric acid natural artificial flavoring yellow six red 40 yellow five blue one sit yeah we gotta do some research to the computer this has they were originally created under the name of Mara's men in 1885 they were renamed to Sour Patch Kids likely to capitalize on the popularity of Cabbage Patch Kids makes sense oh my god okay this wait this would be a article from two years ago how to make oh okay how to make citrus candy tastes like sour patch kids candy so this is basically about a pastry chef who was candied such as peel and then tossing it in a sugar citric acid mix and candy peel does have that kind of chewy texture it's a really interesting idea a method that I'm thinking about in my head to take a combination of citrus peel and green apple and that may be the dehydrator and like create something like a pet a flea which is a natural like fruit gummy and see if I can get something close to that texture I don't know that's gonna work but it might come close enough and be so radical that we are just impressed and well it just kind of what Cosmo says but it could work I don't know what the process is gonna be yet in my mind I'm thinking of two main components one is candied citrus peel and one is green apple jelly which is what I used to start gushers and I'm gonna start by making the green apple jelly I need three and a half pounds of apples I and now I need seven cups of water I'm leaving the peel seven feet all intact the first step is to extract the pectin from the apples so I just simmer them in water all right I can't make green apple jelly on account of there's no gasps it's me bitched out to get me okay I need thin sheet metal like real thick okay let me back up I need to make my own cookie cutter yeah I'm gonna no no I'm gonna take a strip of metal and bend it into the mold that sounds great to maybe be an angle these have been cooking for 40 minutes the idea is that the pectin has been released from the fruit so I'm straining out the solids because I don't like clear jelly I just want the clear liquid with all the pectin in it that's what I should do is let this sit overnight and this will keep straining in the fridge and tomorrow when we come back add the sugar cook that down and then don't move on to the citrus peel but I have no idea that's gonna work and it might be a complete failure so I don't know I'm gonna reserve judgment until tomorrow I feel like it's day 1.5 yeah thank you I'm thinking that I can make like a patch of flee from the pith of the citrus which is very very very bitter but through a series of LAN ching and cooking in a sugar solution it becomes soft and also sweet and that some of the bitterness is taken out the question is how to get something that is the texture of citrus piss into something smooth and punchable I don't know I don't know I'm not gonna work but let's try it in this pot is that apple mixture that ice cream last night and now I'm adding sugar and this is cooking down and it will feel very firm while the apple jelly is cooking I'm going to break down my citrus and start to take cream peel off oh my god hi hi Cosmo when's the last time you had a sour patch kid for me it's been a little while oh yeah this is Cosmo your mom told me cause one that you really like sour so I'm gonna try to make them even more sour than sour patch kids one thing I think would be cool with a homemade version is if we really make the shape more lifelike so I thought maybe we could use your outline as the shape to cut the sour patch kids too and I don't have a plan yet it's just an idea so might not work you were just doing now all right so that's good one that's good there's a profile [Music] the ball awesome this is my apple jelly I'm gonna do I want to do a test on this I have some plates in the freezer cuz that's on your test for this set so when I run my finger through it it's supposed to wrinkle see it wrinkle it's done and now I'm gonna focus on my citrus I think that I would do I might do a lime flavor a Meyer lemon flavor and the lemon I might do cherry cuz we have some cherry juice I'm gonna try that what I need to do now is blanch all of these separately three times in boiling water three times three it's kind of a process this whole thing might not work and I might have spent the entire day of working on it for nothing [Music] click so once it's boiling I'm gonna bring it over to the sink drain the next step is to juice the citrus fruits that I've left over and use those as a flavoring Cosmo give me a hand punch and hop up right here you know there's a little step store for you so you can just start throwing the limes at the top right there then this oh now I know I'm ready three yeah I didn't know you have to do all this this thing is like a real high-tech kind of gadget I'm in against two-thirds of a cup I don't know I feel like I'm doing it wrong awesome that was fun thank you for your help let's see where we are I have all of my blanched peel and I have my juices and zest feeling it very organized at least I'm going to get this in a food processor and chop it up into little bits it smells so good I'm adding the lime zest I'm gonna add all the juice that we have and now the equal weight of sugar so 160 grams sugar okay now I'm gonna get this over onto the stove as I cook it the sugar will dissolve they become sweet and translucent and softer I have no idea what's gonna happen I don't know if it's gonna work best-case scenario is I get a very set very firm very delicious paste that I can spread into a layer and it sets and I've like made sour patch kids this is a wild stab in the dark hot-hot let's my nephew boom mmm oh my god but ashes good right like it's bitter but it's a nice bitter sweet tart balance it's very limey good right all right cool all right I'm gonna add to this some of the green apple jelly what a pretty color right who knew this gonna turn into this color I do not it hasn't fully set that you can see even now it's really really thick so I feel good about adding this as just a boost this is already getting very very thick that's one drop of leaf green gel a mint green yeah it's not that far off the texture is like it's rubbery in a good way and I think it's because of that it's gonna set up pretty firm so we have to just wait and see oh just like a lonely chicken hanging out excited to check out the green the green slime it's just like those discrete pieces of Peel so it's a little granular soothing minute toss this in some citric acid a city so sour to sour oh it hurts my teeth oh I'm gonna try cutting this into pieces and then dehydrating the pieces Bragg got a new dehydrator that he told me I could use but he had something in there so I have to make sure is he here what's he even got in there oh he's making fish jerky I didn't want this to be in with the fish it smells we have to get the old one I think Ivy's in here on I guess medium high just where it is now this is like old reliable this dehydrator it served us well and gourmet meats it does its job it's just bulky and clunky while this is dehydrating I want to try I want to try actually the cherry batch that I'm gonna make with the lemon but I'm gonna use a different assembly method where I basically blend it first before I cook it at a server solution to try to get it very very smooth all right it's pretty it's pretty smooth it's obviously much smoother than before so before I did 50 grams of jelly to about 160 grams of the toilet link it matters whatever this is on its way this is to really reduce down I don't know if Lucario is gonna do anything it's not gonna be the same this is cherry flavor that we've used it's not the most natural I'm more concerned by the texture which is still pretty bit see but definitely get cherry lots of good lemon flavor and not really terribly sweet at all this is going going to go into the fridge thank you so everything is sticky and it itself off and what I have left is the Meyer lemon peel the issues so far our taste and texture which is all of them but now I have to address the toughness of the texture so I think I'm going to pressure-cook it in some water to try to soften it to the point where I can really puree it she's gonna go on high [Music] I'm gonna feel these now cut I think that actually worked really well now I want to blend it to get it really smooth very hot so they try not to burn myself looks pretty good I mean it's a puree there's a little texture to it but other thing looks better than before oh no something got in it what is that oh what's happening I also have another idea I know I was talking about how I don't want to do that cooked sugar thing but this texture this is something you get from cooking sugar to a certain candy stage what I might do is add to that like a cook basically cook the corn syrup and combine them and let it set this is nice and thick I like made caramel okay taking this out oh god oh god I need floss okay okay so the sugar got too hot the corn syrup got too hot and then there just isn't a lot of volume in this bowl and so it the paddle was picking up the sugar before it could hit the fruit and start to incorporate but I think more than anything is the temperature issue Oh God okay I want to try this again basically and incorporate a couple of changes to mess it overall as a parting thought let's check on our lime mixture in here Oh a little bit of Bounce do you want to taste this yeah you can just you don't have to eat the whole thing don't ya right it's like sweet bitter sour the textures kind of weird it's like there's lost like little pieces in there I don't know about that math but but yeah thank you I think if this works it's like true innovation and that's exciting but it's also big if I'm proud of my method overall if not the result it's day three two and a half technically you it's really wet it's not really super elastic it just is it's more brittle I do have to work on the texture significantly today the flavor I like so I have to obviously come up with a different method this time last time I finally graded the zest juice them so I'm skipping all that to save time and I'm just going to do the citrus hats whole [Music] here's all my plants citrus when a pressure cook them one at a time so first I'm going to start with the limes I'm gonna go 15 minutes and the pressure cooker on high sorry you know someone needs a step look at this on high okay it's very fluffy just does that work a lot of air into it you can see how smooth it is but there are still some particles in there so I'm gonna force it through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan this is called a chinois this is a really useful tool for straining thick mixtures like this should I taste it real quick it tastes really bad it's gross but there's no sugar in it it's like eating a whole lime that you blended so I want to add fresh lime juice because I wanted to have a fresher lime flavor and then I'm going to add sugar cook this down like I did on day 2 I could be spending hours on this and have it not work it's not an ideal while the lime mixture is cooking down I'm going to pressure cook my remaining citrus here's everything I'm gonna just set this aside here is my cook down lime mixture it's very like congealed split pea soup that's good the sweetness helps balance it out a lot going to do the cook sugar and mix it together so the sweetness will increase on day two I cooked only corn syrup I'm going to do a mixture of corn syrup granulated sugar and water this time because that didn't go so well I'm gonna cook it to 260 Fahrenheit so I'm looking it we're close it's okay that's ready all right so I'm weighing out 200 grams actually we're gonna add some of this oh wow oh yeah it doesn't look fully incorporated maybe try adding a tablespoon of corn starch see if that does anything sometimes corn starch is just the answer is the cord search will help absorb some of the moisture honestly I do feel like that looks better I think the corn starch sort of found it and like not emulsified it but just brought it together I'm surprised the mixture doesn't seem to be firming up I expected it to start to harden much faster okay well it looks pretty weird it's not as smooth as I was hoping I'll check back on it in 10 minutes or so just to see what the texture is okay so it didn't I wouldn't say that it's set I would say that it stayed very goo like some help adding hard sugar to a firm mixture it became wetter it seems like I've defied the laws of physics here I really don't get it I didn't really think was gonna work so in some ways it's what I expected but I was hoping that it was gonna work so I am also disappointed so now I don't know gelatin code the gelatin route and see what happens I think I might have to do some research yeah well I think I'm gonna Google so one thing I've found on this website a little bit down the road when I have an actual thing to perform into Sour Patch Kids once you have the cut pieces of in this case paddock we this just soak them and enough Everclear to cover before you roll them in a coating of sugar is that ever clear desiccates the candy forming a leathery skin on its surface that will keep the rolling sugar from turning sticky and syrupy for several hours I guess I wasn't aware that Everclear is the brand of alcohol I just know it's a very high proof they sell basically just grain alcohol which is 190 proof that right Everclear enjoys tremendous brand recognition and a loyal and near cult status following that's the description what are they gonna do like give like tasting notes like the grain alcohol that was the only tip I've really picked up from that let me do a proper test with corn syrup the fruit the fruit juice to get everything to spin and and the apple jelly because I want everything really well incorporated before I start to cook it down so this one I'm going to try lemon instead of water I'll use some that cherry juice and the new plan is put everything in the blender and then cooking I like this plan better all right I'm going to take this over to the stove and once it reduces down I had a thermometer in this mixture it cooked down a lot and then I turned it up then I walked away and then it kind of burned and it also never got up to the right temperature so I think it is a failure let's just see so I want to pour this out of the pot so that I don't scrape any of the offensive burnt pieces with it it does not look good this thing will be soaking for a while Asha is kind of pretty I want to quickly try to whisk in a little bit of food coloring I'm gonna put in just like a drop of cherry flavor do a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid smells very cherry Oh remember next time not too hot what is it he's burnt what a tingle okay made me feel like I was gonna pass out for her sighs I think there I put I put too much cherry flavor okay maybe that's it I also burned it a little but the bitterness is also that it's whole lemon in there oh that explain it does that make you feel better that makes me feel better but maybe it's gonna be great you know maybe like dust it with sugar stamp it out call it a day call it a day [Music] texture is not right rota help me but I'm afraid that I'm reaching the point where I have to scrap three days of work and start over how are you gonna shape it I'm so far from having decided on how I'm gonna shape it so it's more sugar no no it's not very sweet so bitter and sour sour bitter it tastes like cherry cough medicine kind of doing great though you're definitely on the right track don't show this part dude I just don't think it's gonna work I think that this whole thing is a huge waste of time it's so hard don't whisper I mean I'll do you want to trade can we trade do you want to smell like this it's not that bad well so where are you at right now what's going on I seem discouraged son I have no I have nothing to show you it's just one failed batch after another are you doing wrong I couldn't even tell you oh I'm so sick of eating steak it's so great to have a little fruit there you go you're gonna feel great okay I will try really go in there and fries can we if I try it we'll see what happens okay yeah what we you're oh you're on deep fry I don't really want to do that what's the next one [Music] we're trading places yeah there you go [Music] couple to talk to yourself I'm a lefty juice they're gonna know oil all right ready Oh God Oh God thumbs up okay ready it's hot over there [Music] thank you thank you [Music] I'm feeling like brakes are very important when you hit a road block and it was good to go over there and be a meal for five minutes but then I came back here and I still don't want to do it so it didn't really help the texture is so wrong with pureed citrus it's like maybe that's just not the way to go I think I have to just scrap this plant even though I did spend two days cooking with citrus and try a version I don't know try version of just juice just lemon juice I have limes here already cut I might as well try lime so maybe what I'll do is juice apple jelly sugar corn syrup let's start at 240 and we can always increase okay try to pour this out onto the parchment certainly the texture is smooth and they slide it onto a tray up in the fridge I feel good about that actually all right look at this mixture it's definitely different than before I mean this is the opposite the problem I was having like this has a dramatic sort of pull texture will try pectin I kind of forgotten what that texture of like stretchy sugar is like and it's not what we're going for I'm innocent mineral let's see they goo [Music] no the goo is still goo you said you were about this okay well after nearly a week in the fridge it has not firmed up at all it's still mush I don't act I don't want to look at it this new method using mostly sugar and corn syrup but then also gelatin and pectin in combination it sounds like a generally sound method to me but it does involve drying them and some of the resources I read said you can do that in dehydrator so we'll try that and we're also going to try that grain alcohol idea to really dehydrate the outer coating what's not ideal about this method is that it does rely on flavoring agents like flavoring oils not a more natural fruit derived flavor but it does let me introduce juice so that's that's a bonus Oh Concord okay that could be fun yeah you know a great flavor a sour cherry flavor and then I can do the other the citrus flavors red yellow orange have to get a mixture of sugar and corn syrup into a saucepan this mixture is just sugar and corn syrup and a little water to encourage it to dissolve and that's it then my Petri net gelatin measured out and I want to start hydrating the gelatin in the fruit juice I think I'm going to start flavor-wise with grape so this one this one will go completely solid it's already on its way all right where our 270 I'm just gonna pull this off you we can keep talking this just has to sit here what is this just some cooked sugar oh very good it is happy birthday that's the gift you can give me yes my gosh mytilini have fun happy birthday so I'm adding my citric acid by gelatin mixture jeez and now my food coloring I'm gonna add a little bit of eggplant and a little bit of the other purple so the idea here is that the heat from the sugar syrup is melting the gelatin okay now I'm gonna pour it out onto my parchment you can see it's definitely starting to set up already Oh God okay [Music] I'm very glad I greets this parchment I'm just trying to cut strips approximately whatever this is by whatever this is I can't I can't remember what the sizes were these I'm going to put in the dehydrator I shouldn't see what's happening in here what happened so that happened what happened was they melted because of the gelatin I think we have to put do it cold but put them in front of the fan in the fridge in the walk-in it's all up here maybe if I put it yeah yeah this is a good spot so the other thing that I want to try is I want to see what happens when I put some of this mixture in that grain alcohol that we got so this is Everclear 190 proof grain alcohol it's going to pour a little bit of this and I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry is unclear if it drives it out just on the surface to create kind of like a skin or if it really dries the whole thing out but let's let's try it I don't know the dream of a sour patch Cosmo is going getting further and further away there are certainly no kind of prefab silicone molds that fit the bill we're better off just punching them out look no do you read math man it's huge if you look at overall area yeah this one's bigger but it's not crazy this one is the best one so far this one is maybe perfect it already looks like me a little person I just have to thin out those arms really does little your ghost the only thing left to do is make more of our sugar mixture so I think I'm starting with lemon orange maybe I'll just it's like hockey puck of pectin and so basically I want to bring this up again after I add the gelatin into the saucepan and agility I have a feeling it's not fully dissolving all right citric acid maybe one drop of cherry flavor one goes to super red food coloring that looks pretty good let's look at the cherry such a firmer now so I just popped it out I want to try punching out some of the shapes oh my god it's so bouncy I can't even press this down into it oh there we go let's do that a thousand more times it I made it it's the sour patch penguin oh it's not that bad well what if I hold on I have such a good idea well I just figured something out which is the reason sour patch kids have no arms is because all of these limbs want to stick to themselves and each other really bad so I think if I continue to make these I have to start soaking them immediately in the green alcohol so that the outside dehydrates and then they become less sticky so I'm just gonna go ahead and make a couple extra flavors to have around me to taste this will now go into the fridge well it's still doing that lemon is good this one's good well this is coming down let's go into the walk-in and just check on the ones they're drying okay I'm gonna try they are very chewy they still you know they're still pretty springy but overall I think I think the step of drying it is a good one and maybe I should leave all of these batches in the walk-in with the pan on them overnight thank you all right it's now been several hours in the grain alcohol they're really not sticky at all on the outside so this is a great technique I think for making sure they don't stick together once these three new flavors are set I'll pop them out of the pans I've put them on a sheet tray and get them in the walk-in to really dry out and then tomorrow the plan is to cut them so if them in alcohol I think and then coat them in the citric acid mixture and then we're right and then we're done all right so it's hard to tell if they've really tried out or if they're just really cold they feel very firm more I think the orange more than the others I want to taste the orange the orange one looks really good I think maybe the best one yet and it is doing a little bit more of that whole flavors good it seems like the most successful batch yet the flavor is better and then this is the first one I made the sour cherry you get a nice pull but not like a crazy long stretch I don't think that I would gain anything from making anything over again I'm really happy with these so I want to focus on cutting out shapes you want me this is Cosmo as I can get we did this like weeks ago when I thought I was gonna be better at this so we're going to just take a few liberties and say that this is the shape I don't even like the shape though I'd almost rather do this one and make them really big it's just so much easier to punch out something this size you know I forgot to grease it it's not bad I think it's kind of cute it looks more like a baby all the sour patch kids are just gonna be the larger kind more like this one all right now I'm going to into production mode cutting all the shapes getting them in here - as I cut out each one I want to start soaking them in the grain alcohol because it will prevent them from sticking to each other so while these soak I can at least put together that's our coating so that's one part citric acid let's try two parts sugar know that I think it's good we're gonna go with this I'm just wondering if I should try to flavor the coating for each one I feel like I haven't done my best work so far and maybe this is my only opportunity to to impress alright so I'm gonna make three different flavors of the coating lemon orange and cherry I'm just gonna get everything in the dehydrator in small bits and then once it's dry I'll pulverize it in a spiced friend hopefully nothing bad happens try enough I think I'm just going to add all of the lemon to one here's orange give it a little taste but really so I'm ready to start the coating Oh [Music] these little guys it is an enormous size [Music] do they need double coats well done that was orange anyway okay finally done with all the coating I my three flavors I think they're done and I think they're done because I was told they have to be done because we don't have time to let them dry for a week so Oh Cosmo will love these they're extremely sour not even that sweet on citric acid there in the end I am proud of the relatively clean fruit flavor of each of the colors maybe those are that's like at your own risk it's quite sour the only thing that's left is to have people taste them hopefully they'll be kind and not too harsh yeah they're huge this might be like the resurface I think of the more than that you want to weigh I'm in sea nine point eight grams that's a lot all right let's see what one of the big guys 55.8 it's like you're getting a deal yeah exactly I love a deal now I've had a Linea a cheerio sour yeah it's really sour too much on the coating this is like a little sharper okay like adults hour this feels like good I'll take it big sharks are the flavor of this is fantastic thank you no I did the best I could you really I just wish I'd done better that's how I feel every literally every day oh they're done but they're not good they're very very welcome Oh so to send one home to Cosmo with our sincere apologies tell them that I struggled so hard when it came time to cut them you delivered on her on the more sour but yeah yeah yeah actually not a bad texture I like further to service you do really they have like a gingerbread man oh that was the cutter I used good to make them nice shape nice color great job thanks bro - thank God for rota okay final thoughts trying to keep it positive next time we have to do a gummy candy I do feel like I learned a lot this was just sort of like very repetitive and I wasted kind of three days of time on that weird citrus peel idea so this one was frustrating but now I know more for next time I think Cosmo is really gonna like these because they're so so her and maybe I should have tempered that citric acid coating but I know that I at least have one true fan and then as Cosmo and that's the important things to have pleased the people who already love sour patch kids is great I never want to see them again here's how you make gourmet Sour Patch Kids combine 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of water and 3/4 cup corn syrup in a small saucepan and bring to a boil starting to dissolve the sugar stop stirring and clip a candy thermometer to the side and cooked at 290 degrees Fahrenheit meanwhile bloom 50 grams of powdered unflavored gelatin in a half a cup of sour cherry lemon or orange juice then stir in 15 grams of pectin stir this mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt then stir in one and a quarter teaspoons of citric acid and the corresponding fruit flavor oil or extract until smooth pour the mixture into a greased parchment lined pan and chill until set punch out shapes using your cutter and soak the cutouts in grain alcohol to dehydrate the surface place on a rack and chill uncovered in the refrigerator until very firm and chewy dehydrate lemon zest orange zest and dried sweet cherries in a dehydrator on high then grind into a powder combined with citric acid and granulated sugar to taste coat the sour patch kids in the correspondingly flavored sour sugar are you ready to try the sour house mom kids yeah this is really good would you say to sour nothing in six hours", "hpXTc5Zwj98": "hi welcome to Katie's playtime thank you to all my subscribers for asking me to make gummy bears and yes I do have a video already uploaded about how to make gummy bears using gelatin but in this video I'm going to do something different something where some people out there sitting at home don't like gelatin in their food so I've come up with a different recipe I've come up with a vegan vegetarian recipe on making your own gummy bears so for all the families out there I hope this is the winner for you and if this doesn't interest you I do have another video with gelatin so let's get started so the first thing you need to make sure you have is your glucose syrup so that's it that's the replacement for corn syrup so either glucose or corn syrup you also need some water you need some fruit juice you need some citrus pectin which is um you can actually get that from the health foods section in your supermarket or from any health food store and it is actually made in Mexico so for anyone over in America at the moment and you'll be able to find it I'm sure you also need some pink food coloring and over here you need some agar agar now agar agar is going to replace our gelatin fruit our citrus fruit pectin is actually going to replace our jelly so we also need some citrus acid citric acid if you're going to roll it in to make a sour type of lollies and some castor sugar and I've just got some icing sugar in a bowl here ready for when I roll them to make them just nice and plain we also need our sauce spoon a spoon make sure it's wooden or plastic because if it's a metal one it will heat up all the ingredients too quickly and also we can't forget our silicon molds so let's get started so the first thing you need is 1/2 a cup of water and place that in your saucepan you also then need 1/4 of a cup of glucose syrup and it's really really thick and gluggy so just be careful and take your time and then just give it a nice mix you need to mix us so both ingredients are nice and smooth together so our next step is to put our gelatin replacement in and that's going to be our agar agar now you can get that from your health food section in the supermarket or your health food store and it's gluten free its fructose free dairy free nut free and lactose free so anybody out there that's suffering from any of those this is the alternative to still make gummies and still have fun so in a normal recipe where it says how much gelatin you need just convert it into the same amount in agar agar so in my previous video it was two tablespoons of gelatin so I'm going to use two tablespoons of agar agar and we're going to mix that in and make sure there's no lumps okay so once you've mixed it and it's all nice and clear we're now going to put our jelly replacement in now what we want to do is we want to put one cup of our fruit juice so I'm just going to use my half a cup and I'm going to do two halves to make a one cup so I've got one half and then my other half to make one and in jelly it also does have gelatin in jelly so with this I'm going to use citrus pectin and what that is is that's gluten free as well dairy free it's soy free and it's lactose free and it's not free so all we're going to do is use three and a half teaspoons of this so it's a bit thick so we're going to add one and a half cups of water and now put three cups of sugar our last thing we need to put in is a food coloring so I've chosen the pink okay so now all of my ingredients are mixed together let's go over to the stove and heat it up and fingers crossed away so turning on the gas stove and just move it down to more of the lower heat and place our mix on and just keep stirring so keep stirring it until it goes nice and clear and it goes nice and like sticky if that makes any sense and once it cooks to that part then it's ready to put in our molds so come with me and let's start putting it in and so just using two teaspoons just carefully place it the mixture into your molds I'm using silicon molds just because it is easier to and take the gummies out afterwards so now I've put my molds in the fridge for half an hour and then in half an ounce time we'll see what we've got fingers cars yeah okay so our gummies are already they're out of the fridge so they're ready to be demolded and we'll see what we have got oh wow that looks great and so yes they are sticky like my other video so I've got my sugar my icing sugar and my citric acid here on plates and so that's just going to give me different flavors okay so there you have it I've got vegan vegetarian lactose-free gluten-free gummy lollies which I would probably say has a little bit of a jelly texture to them and they're not as chewy as your gummy so I suppose I now I have to do the taste tester so here we go let's just do a plain one mmm yeah definitely a jelly type of line really good now I've got the plain one to do so that's just plain no coating mmm and you can see inside is very jelly like absolutely amazing I know you're waiting for to see my face with the sour one I'll be ready I really travel that really jesu at the same time so thank you to all my subscribers that has asked me to do gummy lollies I have given you two videos because I just love you all so much enjoy I hope you enjoy making these at home be safe don't forget to Like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in my next video", "ZHW1DPHJ7pA": "hey guys vat19 mej here with a review of the green apple world's largest gummy bear well chances are you've had a green apple flavored gummy in your life there's one of the more prominent flavors and like anything you know like they've got me wanting to stuff they're mostly green so it shouldn't be very surprised that this tastes like green apple so it tastes like a green apple slaw please in it just like an actual green apple you know except the gummy form so it's really good if you like green apple you will like this there's no disappointment there so what were the only flavor I haven't really liked that much is orange so that's a good flavor the other flavors I reviewed it should not be uploaded yet because so far people are voting for green apple most so anyway uh yeah quick review green apples very good tastes like what you'd expect worth buying if you're a fan of green apple flavored things thank you guys for watching hmm I will see you tomorrow", "HEMxJl7_cEA": "[Music] welcome back to unwrapped i'm mark summers sorting through lots of halloween treats how about gummies they're a standby on the trick-or-treat streets they come in many shapes and sizes including these creepy crawlers so right now we're gonna go behind the scenes to see how they're made [Music] gummy glow worms are one of ferreira pan candy's top selling treats they make the gummies with lots of gelatin blended in this machine with corn syrup sugar and water surprisingly every step is mechanized the machine does all the measuring the program will run and it will say how many pounds of each ingredient when you hit that amount in the tank then the valve will close and the next ingredient will come in fully automated here they heat the mixture to 240 degrees fahrenheit then it's put into a vacuum that cools it and removes much of the moisture the next step would be to add any of the color the flavor the juice before we deposit it and that's done in this huge machine they call a cfa or color flavor additive deck now this is a very critical piece of equipment because it's measuring out precisely how much color how much flavor and is doing it match after batch after batch so that every time you buy a gummy worm you're getting the same flavor and the same color in that gummy worm now the colored flavored mixture is ready to turn into gummy worms but most people are shocked to find out how gummies take their shape the gummy mixture never touches a mold instead it goes into this white stuff which has been pressed with a mold into a gummy shake it's a corn starch with a small percent of mineral oil and if i wanted to make a gummy hand i'd flatten it out press in and then just fill that up with slurry cool the cornstarch is actually a better mold than a metal pan plus it's easier to get the gummies out once they're dry and we use a piston pump and a nozzle that lines up directly with the mold and injects the liquid candy into the starch they can fill 28 of these boards a minute which is a total of six thousand seven hundred twenty worms every sixty seconds or four hundred three thousand an hour and over nine and a half million a day just in case you're counting these boards are taken to a drying room for 18 hours then put back on the machine to be processed after the product shakes out of the mold it goes through a steamer gets it all sticky and then it will roll in the sugar acid blend the sugar acid gives these black forest gummies their famous sweet and sour taste especially popular with the under 12 set after the product goes through the steamer it's going to roll in this drum where it's going to get covered with the sugar acid blend that gives us the glowworm and sourness from here we'll convey it up we'll catch it in boards and send it off to the packaging room and then all that's left to do is to put them in a package and let kids do the rest you",

support I just popped that 10,000 market oh my god think you could not have done any of that without your support guys I really really appreciate it it just means the world to me you like me you really really like me sorry just being an ass having some fun alright so today what I'm gonna do now that I showed you how to do canna candy sugar & Canas syrup we can now make our gummies without using butter and the Gerber is an emulsifier however if you want to make them super super strong absolutely go ahead and stuff the butter back in there but this gives you far more control over how strong or weak that you would like to make them now you guys are always asking me how much milligrams etc something is and I don't generally tend to answer that very often because it is all dependent upon what you make how you make it once you're starting THC is etc so what I've done is in the description there I've included a link for the calculator that I use it's a free signup it's a little course you're more than welcome to have a look take a look at it listen to her she's really interesting and lots of information but the calculator you can use for free and that's what I use so then you can go ahead and you can make your calculations and figure out how strong etc that you want to make your candies and with this it gives you a lots of versatility so you can go all can of sugar and syrup or half-and-half which is what I'm gonna do in the recipe so I will stop babbling on now and I'm gonna get into the ingredients of course and of course what we need and then we'll put all that stuff together and make some awesome gummies there we go alright guys all right so for our new gelatin for our new gummy version here you're gonna use one box of your paper flavored jello I three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water for blooming your gelatin or what I use are these kool-aid waters so they're just flavored water so I now use these in place of water they're great because they add more flavour to it or you can kind of combine some flavors which is really cool to do so I use those things are nice they're lighter and sugar and said just adding more flavor now another thing you can do for adding flavor is juice crystals now I get these at the bulk bar and you can only get them during the summer time but I get these in all different flavors and I've got two tablespoons of those again enhancing the flavor that way if you don't want to use or have these flavors artificial flavors you can go use those which work great the other thing you're going to need is a quarter cup of your can of syrup and a quarter cup of water for our jello and then for our candy side our candy version so it's going to be like the other one where we do the cook you're going to need a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar or again you can use a full can of sorry a full cup of your can of sugar same thing with your syrup I'm using a quarter cup of canned syrup and a quarter cup of light corn syrup again you can go and use as much or as little of either of those as you like I like to do the half-and-half mainly for taste and not to kill people so that's my kind of my you I don't want anybody rendered completely useless and then we are going to need 1/2 a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and then as well if you want to add additional colors or flavors you can add those optionally as well and as I said if you want to add your butter as well it really makes them super duper you can do that you're just going to follow exactly the same thing except the previous steps from the previous version with regards to adding the butter and the Goregaon to emulsify it now something else I wanted to say and the same thing now in this version I'm not using the clear gel however you can use the clear gel exactly the same way as you do in the previous recipe of the regular and sour gummy recipe that's a good one to follow it's the most up-to-date and gives you both those versions that you can use and that's all we need for our ingredients and now we'll get into our equipment and then we will get the best part go and we'll get all this stuff put together alright so the equipment that you're going to need just like the other recipes a double boiler I just do a makeshift I get a bowl that will make sure that your water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you will need a smaller saucepan for our candy syrup two spatulas you will need your candy thermometer and you will need a larger pot that your bought is that your saucepan small saucepan will fit into ice water water with ice in it but a little tongue-tied today and obviously your candy molds now a lot of you ask me how many candy is gum you will get out of a batch now it's all depending obviously on the size molds that you use if you use about this large size I got these from Michaels you will get about sixty if you use of this size gummy which is kind of a little bit larger than those big ones you're going to get it probably about 75 to 100 and if you use the little teeny tiny ones then you're going to get about 150 to 200 of them so that's approximately what that recipe will break down to you for you and now d'leh before we get started there is something very important that I found out from my other recipe when I started this is and I don't do this in the other recipes but when we're working with the can of sugar and the can of syrups it is a must that we oil down the sides and the insides of our pot for the candy syrup reason being when it heats up and starts boiling the oil THC oil starts to separate and it sticks to the smiths of the metal of the pot you might have noticed that if you did that with a can of syrup which is why I redid the video for that specific reason so we're going to do things a little bit differently than we do for the regular candy recipe but I'll show you all those details once we get into it but the very first thing and don't really don't want to forget is we're going to lightly grease our saucepan and hold on just couldn't dribble a little bit of oil into it and then make sure to work it all the way around make sure to get it right into the corners because anywhere that this oil is not where there's no oil your THC will sit the only thing that dissolves THC oil is oil because it is oil soluble by doing this we're going to be able to scrape anything that sticks to the sides off much much easier then seeing all your products that they're going oh what happened so you said you want to lightly grease that you don't want to have any excess oil so make sure to do that up as well as your spatulas you want to lightly oil your spatulas for the same reason when we scrape it off the sides if these are not oiled it sticks to it and it doesn't come off so you want to make sure anything that is going to be touching the THC the syrup you want to make sure that you all and that's it I'm gonna get into putting our ingredients together and get this started oh one other thing I wanted to cover is with your moles I don't spray my moles beforehand but I have found sometimes that they do stick but so what I do is I care them so I will spray them or oil them down lightly let it sit for 20 minutes in the mold and then wash them out so it still leaves that oily feel but it's not gonna leave your Piquet knees all greasy and makes it far easier for them to come as well as you only have to cure them once every few once every five or six batches or so so it lasts a long time by doing it that way all right so now I promise we'll get into the ingredients in our candy all righty so the very first thing that we are going to do is we are going to microwave our quarter cup of liquid for about 50 seconds till it's boiling and we're going to bloom our unflavored gelatin all right so you're going to evenly sprinkle your gelatin over the top of your liquid whether you use water or the kool-aid water and then you are going to stir it in now a lot of punches I explained in about whether that your gummies did not are not that they're too sticky but they're not gelatin enough that can depend a lot of power on your gelatin I just bought a batch of gelatin because I buy a bulb that didn't it wasn't blooming at the strength of it or something was not working well I did two batches and I had almost double the gelatin so a lot of it is dependent upon your gelatin now one test that I do is when I put in the three tablespoons and mix it in it should start very quickly to get the texture of apple sausage and clicking up pretty quickly now this is not so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add in another half a tablespoon of gelatin yes I've just sprinkled on another half a tablespoon and I'm gonna stir that in and now I'm getting that texture of applesauce can you kind of see what I mean that's how you know you're probably are at the great strength for your gelatin starting off if your gelatin is not right from the beginning if it's mushy I'll show you when we go to put this in but that's the texture it should be once you once we've got it mixed in now we're gonna set that aside for five minutes or so to let that bloom now meanwhile we will add our box of jell-o I'm giving the blueberries well berry blue and we are going to add in our boiling water and stir that around and get it dissolving see was it and then just keep scraping because the jello will cause the sides of the bowl are cool it's good to just kind of stick to it so just keep scraping the sides down as you go and turn your heat on to low so again we only want to melt our gelatin over a hot water bath we don't want it hot at boiling at all that's what breaks our gelatin a lot of the time is you don't even think that you've got it too hot but really past hot water probably by 150 degrees it is that's about all you need so that's that's a big mistake that a lot of people make myself included so I'm just going to continue to stir that gently until the gelatin is dissolved and then we will add in our corn syrup and our other stuff and once your gelatin and that has started to melt the sugar takes longer because the sugar melts at a higher at a bit of a higher heat so it just takes a little bit longer but once your gelatin and that is melted you can add in your corn syrup and your flavor crystals if you're wanting to add so you saw your canister your quarter cup of Kanna syrup and then your flavored juice crystals if you want to add those in as additional flavoring and again just stir that until it all starts gets incorporated and now for you guys asking for those clear gummies how do I get my gummies clear this well you can now you could have perfectly clear gummies so I'm gonna kick it continue to stir this and just gently mix it together until everything is melted and combined I'd you notice I got my nails done so for all of you those wishing that I get them done they're done and to those of you commented there you go I know I looked at the videos and thought make and those are ratty looking hands so I do apologize hopefully it'll be better from now on in the future I hope you like these a little bit better do you got a look at them for quite a long time so why not make them a little bit more attractive and also just remember to continually scrape down the sides of your bowl so that the gelatin is not sticking to the sides and just to show you this is just how hot your water should be there shouldn't be any boiling just a little bit of steam coming off of that that's as how that's as hard as you want to get it otherwise any hotter than that it's gonna break your gelatin alright so now that everything's pretty much dissolved I'm going to add in our gelatin now here's another thing if your gelatin is after 5 minutes or so blooming is mushy when you touch it then your gelatin is not strong enough so whether it's old and it's weakened or there are different gelatin with different strengths if it is nice and firm to the touch and no mushy you're good to go so I just split this up into pieces slap her in and you're just gonna let that you're just gonna gently again stir that until it completely melts and again if you start to see any kind of foaming may take it off your heat immediately it's getting too hot so I'm just gonna let them set them going to continue to stir that until my gelatin is fully melted well once your gelatin is melted and everything looks good and it is nice and translucent just set it off to the side and now we're going to start our candy syrup alright for our candy syrup in goes our half a cup of white sugar our half a cup of Candace Canon sugar our Candace syrup quarter cup a can of syrup like I said before you're more than welcome to play around with your different measurements on that as long as it equals 1/2 a cup either way it doesn't matter and our quarter cup of light corn syrup our half a cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're going to gently stir that till ever - your syrup till your sugar and water and everything's just combined and then once you're combined here turn your heat on to medium Cline to start and then we're going to drop it down to medium once it begins to boil and you're just going to continue stirring this make sure to get all around the edges because the sugar likes to sit there and so we're going to continue to stir this until it starts to boil now all of my and all the other candy recipes I say as soon as we start boiling we're gonna stop stirring and use our brush not in this recipe and I'll show you once it starts boiling as I said the oils yeah I got a little syrup on the burner there so the oils start to separate out with the heat and until it gets all to the same kind of temperature it will they will stick to the side so we're going to have to continually work the sides of the pot but you're going to want to be very very gentle because we don't want to spit dirt into the syrup so as I said I'll show that all to you once it gets there now you'll start to notice as as it's starting to heat up if you scrape the sides of your pot see all that that's your oil and that's what we want to make sure it gets back into our syrup so I usually have to use the two you want as I said you have to grease both spatulas here and work it off get it back into the syrup and we're gonna have to do this continuously through the whole cooking process so at anytime that you see any darkness starting to form on the side make sure to scrape it down and as your syrup gets hotter you can just put your spatula in it'll just melt it off and also make sure when you are scraping the sides of your pot hold on to the handle firmly I've done it before I wasn't paying attention and whoops and the last thing you want is molten lava being poured anywhere other keeping it in the pot so when your syrup begins to bubble starts boiling you're gonna touch your candy thermometer and remember this is normally where I say we stop stirring not this time so we're not actually going to stir it what we're gonna do is just to continually scrape around the sides of the pot but don't go deep into the syrup we just want to stay around the bubble area and you just want to keep pulling this in so this is the alcohol of the excess alcohol and stuff burning off and any impurities that are in it so see how it's gathering up on the sides that's what we want to make sure get them back into our syrup whatever is supposed to cook off will cook off whatever is good will stay in so again just gently don't go into the stirs syrup just gently keep going around the sides and you'll do behind the candy thermometer towards the end and we are going to cook our syrup - if you want a soft candy you're gonna cook it to 260 if you want a firm candy you can go as high as 280 280 is soft crack I'm gonna go to just before that I'm going to take this to 275 but you see what I mean about the oils how they just continue they'll keep going to the sides of the pot as it heats up and gets up to temperature it will it will the oils will get incorporated and once your syrup is boiling in that you want to just turn your heat down to medium just medium a little above medium I said then don't forget to get behind in behind the thermometer because it will hide in behind there I love the smell of this syrup cooking it's oh it smells so awesome oh and just as a tip for safety always have a fan either an overhead fan I've got one going or the if you've got an overhead on your stove regardless when you're ever working with tinctures even though you've working them in a dehydrated yeah most of it's cooked off some of them may not be and you just want on the safety side always have a fan going and leave don't be sparking anything up in the in the general area so you've had your gelatin sitting over on the side and you have a look and you've noticed that there's all this white inky foam stuff and you're sure positive that you didn't do it high on high heat the heat didn't get too hot that'll happen so nice if the gelatin is old and it's starting to break down so if you do see that in order to compensate for that bloom another tablespoon of unflavored gelatin and we're going to add it into the candy mixture at the end that's gonna help us compensate for the gelatin that's broken in our mixture here so that will help it so anytime that your candies come out super sticky and you can't get them out of the mold the reason is is because the gelatin is not gelling properly so there's a really handy tip there for you guys now in order to get that out because I don't want that in to go my syrup I'm gonna run this through a strainer before we put it into our syrup so now I might actually my syrup while I was babbling away there is getting close to temperature I've got my ice water ready to go and as soon as it hits temperature I'm gonna drop the bottom into the pot and once the temperature starts coming down and the cooking process is stopped I'm gonna set it to the side until the temperature comes down to 240 before we add our gelatin in just watch your thermometer till until the temperature starts coming down and your bubbles start stop bubbling and then just set it to the side and said until your temperature comes down to 240 all right so now my syrup is cooled and then it's say because I don't want that white foamy stuff into my syrup I'm going to use a strainer to pour it through that way it'll catch all the chunks of jell-o gelatin and being bad and I'm going to mix that in now I also what I did was I bloomed another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid and we're going to add that in a little bit in a little bit so right now you're going to stir your jello and your candy syrup until it is all combined and if you find that your syrup is a little too sticky and it's solidified you can put your heat on to minimum you just want to heat the bottom to get the syrup off the bottom now you can make sure that you do so that you scrape the sides and if you said if you find that it's too hard coming off turn your heat on and it'll eventually start to melt so you just want to want to keep doing that until everything is completely melted in all the same temperature all right so now that everything is all melted together and nicely mixed now this is a test that I do to determine whether my syrup is did a job correctly if I pull it up and you see how it just goes in a nice smooth syrup it doesn't really seem to start gelling or anything it stays in a fine line so that's kind of telling me that this is gonna turn out way too sticky it's gonna come out what's it like you can't get it out of the mold it's more candy than the gelatin that's what I said about my gelatin breaking there that I knew that was gonna happen so I've added it I'm gonna add in the additional gelatin that I bloomed and I'm just gonna stir that until it's completely dissolved so now if you want your syrup just translucent that nice clear there you go you've got it you can go ahead and put it into your bottles your squirt bottles or use the little eye droppers for dispensing into your molds but however I never like to keep things plain so I'm gonna do half-and-half or I've got translucent and solid and also just to give you a look to see how to go about doing that all right so now when after adding the additional gelatin in now when I do my test you'll see it's thicker and it'll start to split up and almost solidify in midair so that's how you know it's likely going to set correctly I still had to not do things correctly that's occasionally but that is a very good indication that you're safe and good to go so if you wanted translucent go ahead and put it into your bottles at this point or use your eye dropper dispensers or whatever it is that you get it into your moles however I of course need to always get fancy so I'm gonna split this into two colors so I've got half of it translucent and half of it of the solid blue whoops all right so I'm just gonna eyeball this here if you want to be exact you can pour it into a measuring cup and split it exactly however I've been doing this from this pot for quite a while so I'm pretty good at it sometimes so because I mix the blue with the green because obviously the green from our can of syrup and our sugar so it's turned out a little bit greenish and I actually want this to be blue so I'm going to add in a little bit of blue color and then on 1/2 I'm going to add in white so this one I'm mixing in a few drops of blue you can use any kind of food coloring the gel base oil-based water base for this for this particular candy recipe does not matter so we're just gonna get that stirred in oh that's a pretty color you see it on the white that's nice that's a nice kind of teal color then in my other half I'm gonna pour in some of the blue the same kind of teal but this is gonna give me the solid background as the white now if you guys have white on hand make sure that you shake it really really well if it's hot it sitting for a while it does separate and you will find that if you pour it in you're gonna get a little tiny white it doesn't go well you get little white lumps or something like that it just doesn't blend really nicely so make sure to shake it really really well you can almost hear it come back together it's like you can almost hear the water at the top and then all kind of comes together and sounds a little bit thicker so I'm gonna pour a little bit of that in isn't that pretty so again you're just gonna thoroughly mix that in until it is one complete uniform color and once I've got that i'll get it into my bottles and we'll get this into the mold there's a little trick i learned the other day find it by Occident that's on most things happen so I'm if you want to have a half and half candy where you've got the clear on the bottom and the solid on the top what you can do to easily make that happen is use your hand blender on this we whip a bunch of air into it and once you put them together the air is all I'm automatically gonna bring the solid color up to the top or if you want to do that with the if you want it the other way around then air Rach you're clear but you're gonna have to wait a while for the bubbles to come out because that's gonna make it not so clear so I recommend just putting the solid on the back you can do that it's just a quick way of doing it otherwise you have to pour one layer let it set a little bit and then pour your second layer well aren't I just a cesspool of useless information today I'm just gonna pour this into my squirt bottle this should make a full almost a full bottle or a little bit more see bang almost right on now if you guys have to haven't seen these before these are the best squirt bottles ever they just make putting it into the mould so much easier especially if you want to blend colors absolutely highly recommend these I've got there's a link for them in the description there for you to make it easy if you'd like to order them and I'm just gonna do my clear and we'll get this going all right so I said I always do two colors I always like doing that so I did combination I'll either just whoosh or if you want to happen half you can do it that way you can go this way freestyle whatever you like and that's it get them all into your mold and you're gonna put them in the fridge for a minimum of two to four hours sometimes they've got to go overnight now if you let them go overnight and they're still sticking you can't get them out of the mold put them into the freezer for a few hours let them freeze up take one mold out of it I'd add out at a time and pop them out as quickly as possible if they still if there's still stop the first you'll come out if it starts to stick throw it back in the freezer work on another mold put them into a double boiler melt them down on low heat and add another tablespoon of gelatin melt it and recast them and that will fix that problem for you and that's it enough I'll come back low will pop these out so you can have a look at them and I'll show you how to sugarcoat them not that sugarcoating is that difficult but you can coat them with the can of sugar and just show you an easy way of doing it and that'll be it will say goodbye candies upset and you can do this in a bowl or I found that doing them in a large plastic bag worked a lot easier so in this I put a half a cup of regular sugar 1/2 a cup of can of sugar and I put a quarter part about a quarter cup of the flavored drink crystals that I used in my recipe again the drink crystals are totally optional for you just adds that little bit extra flavor and then I added about a half a teaspoon of citric acid because I wanted these to be a little bit more on this our side if you just want to have just a little bit of a tick bite but not really sour at all I add a quarter teaspoon so I'll do those two my sweet ones and then to the sour I use a 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid I don't recommend using much more than that one it's not going to the sour flavor isn't that great and it can also melt your candies because citric acid acid is water soluble so simple enough you can actually see it oh and I also have sorry a wire a wire rack with parts line o parchment paper line line on top of it for them to dry so I just pop them out these guys are popping out nicely and I get and what I do is I do one mold at a time so I leave the rest of them in the fridge because otherwise they start to warm up and they can makes it difficult sometimes for them to come out of the mall so I just think about one at a time and once I get them on the bag I go a little bit there and I just fish them out and shake off the excess sugar and we just lay them out to dry here just like all our other candies this is just a slightly smaller mold that I use same thing now see sometimes you'll do that and you'll see you think oh no they're not gonna come out they're stuck just pull the edges away and then they just they'll just come right out now if you do that and it doesn't come out that's when you would put them into the freezer so again you see that just around the edges to pull it away and they're good to go and that's about it I'm just gonna go through and sugarcoat the rest of these guys and then I'll be back to say goodbye well guys that's my little demo there on your cannon Candace Eric and sugar gummy bears I hope you enjoyed the demo as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to ask and thank you guys so much again for your support and let's get to the 50,000 whoo all right so you have an awesome rest of your day and thanks again for watching [Music]", "aSO-ZBoJ0DQ": "I am gonna be eating one of these very excited these are like hair on that there's these are CBD gummies and I already opened it says here it's a full spectrum organic cannabidiol l-theanine Piper myth this something or others some other thing that I can't pronounce and some other thing that I can't pronounce no THC and no marijuana but my body hurts I don't want to get high so let's try this what's in here oranges in a red so this orange one also tiny look at it can you see it mmm Harel serving size one gummy ten milligrams per gummy let's see how I feel later hello everyone so it's been a little while since I took the gummy and maybe I would say like 20 or 30 minutes but I am like super tired right now and I think it's only 8 10 p.m. and it's too early to go asleep but I think that I'm gonna brush my teeth anyway because just in case I fall asleep I don't wanna like fall asleep without brushing my teeth because that's just weird and gross but I'm gonna try to stay awake for a little bit longer but I don't think that I will be and I will be super upset if like I go to bed soon and then wake up at like 4:00 in the morning or something but tired alright so that was pretty much it for this video thank you for watching and I will see you guys later", "i-JX7qnWkR0": "[Music] kitty up so the ingredients that we're going to need for our gummies are pretty much the same as the original you're gonna want two packages of the um jello this is the three ounce the small box or 85 grams whatever flavor you'd like two tablespoons or two packages of unflavored gelatin so two packages of those nox unflavored gelatin a half a cup of water room temperature and a half a cup of water ice cold you have to have ice cold water to bloom gelatin we're going to want a quarter cup of light corn syrup for those of you who don't like like do not like corn syrup you can use invert sugar glucose honey or a gob you just need a syrup in there and what it does is it creates a barrier between your sugar crystals so that they don't come back together that's why it's needed some type of syrup we are going to need a quarter cup of can of butter a quarter teaspoon of citric acid a half a teaspoon of gour gum and gorgum is an emulsifier which allows us to bring oil and water together because as everybody knows they are mortal enemies so in order for them to be able to become friends you use an emulsifier and what an emulsifier will do is it takes each molecule a water molecule and an oil they go in together in a bubble and it creates a bubble around uh those two molecules so it creates its own um kind of uh it creates an emulsion that's what it does and that's what emulsion is bringing oil and water together to be a uniform liquid you cannot use xanthan gum it is not an emulsifier it is a thickener and it is a stabilizer it is not an emulsifier gum is an emulsifier a stabilizer and a thickener as well as it has a natural gummy uh texture to it which helps with your gummies and for those of you who don't use it or can't get it uh you can use soy it would be one teaspoon of soy or sunflower lecithin the other reason why i like the gourd gum is it has no flavor whereas lecithin does and i don't like the flavor less of them in substitute of water if you want to add a little bit more flavor boost you can use these kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters or basically any juice that doesn't contain real fruit if you do use a juice that has real fruit you have to use a mold inhibitor like this little the lorraine's mold inhibitor and that is a must otherwise they will go moldy in a couple of weeks then this is optional this and alcohol or um everclear the 94 alcohol or grain alcohol a really cool trick alert with this uh which you'll have to wait till the end to see it um but yeah this is an option um or if you make tincture you can use your tincture provided it is made with the high percentage alcohol it has to be the 94 ish around there for flavorings you can use the lorraine flavor oils i'm today i'm going to be making uh lemon raspberry so i'm going to start with a lemon base split it up split out half raspberry and make the other half of them and make them look all pretty gel food coloring now if you want to create a solid background white food coloring a thing with this you can only use one or two drops if you use too much your gummies will not set no matter what you can freeze them you doesn't matter what you do they will not set if you use too much very important one or two drops only and i think i've got all the ingredients here covered let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made all right so the equipment that we are going to need is basically the same as the old recipe there is one major difference we are going to throw away the immersion stick or the hand blender that apparently is a very bad thing for our gelatin so on top of creating a mountain of air bubbles so that your gummies don't turn out nice and clear it also breaks the gelatin so for any of you have this white goopy stuff on the top of your candies the silicone spatula or silicone whisk is going to resolve that issue so we're not going to use the hand blender silicone only metal will damage uh the gelatin who knew it was such a delicate little flower so silicone spatula very important silicone or a wooden spoon a little strainer or a bigger one if you've got one doesn't have a small one a small um saucepan heavy bottom is preferable and on heat transfer which means when you look at the bottom of your pot there is no discoloring um it's always one even if it is discolored in spots it means that your pot gets hotter in those particular areas and it can damage your uh your product so heavy bottom not heat transfer is the best thing to go for you of course your gummy molds these bottles are one of the best for dispersing your um dispensing your syrup into the into the molds they're by a sweet sugar bell and two reasons i like is because it uses the decorating tips which makes it nice as well as they have a very deep um lip to them whatever you call this a lip screw thing if you use the dollar store ones or ones that um have the really short short neck on them and then uh you're more likely it's the lids gonna pop off because the syrup is warm there's not a lot well the pressure on it it just pops them off so fair warning either that or um one of these candy funnels uh works great as well or the little odd dropper things that those some of those molds come with you're going to need some parchment paper and a drying rack i think i have most of the equipment covered you know me i always forget something um so let's jump right into those ingredients and let's get this made so on to making our candies so the very first thing we want to do is to bloom our gelatin so i've got my two tablespoons of gelatin here and you want to um sprinkle it onto your ice cold water and as i said for gelatin to bloom correctly water has to be i size very very very cold so we just want to sprinkle it across the top so this way it doesn't clump and then you're going to stir it into the water make sure it's well mixed in and that there's no lumps now one tip for you when you're doing this with your unflavored gelatin while you're mixing it it should start to um form into the texture of um of applesauce if it doesn't then you need to add a little bit more gelatin either your gelatin is not as strong or used a little too much water over whatever it is it's probably not going to be um quite enough so like this is just a little too soupy so i'm going to add in just a sprinkle there we go so that's more the texture that you want see like applesauce and then i usually toss mine into the fridge until i need it so i've added my um two boxes of jello to my pot already and then in goes our light corn syrup or whatever syrup you choose to use and yes you can use can of syrup and our other half a cup of water now this is one thing i learned the citric acid does not go in until the end so you never had your citric acid while you're preparing once everything's done and heated that's when you add in your citric acid the acid works like acid it melts things so it interferes with the cooking or the setting process if you add it in too early same thing if you use the cooked version make sure to only add it once you're done so once you've got your water and your corn syrup and your jello in the pot you just want to get her mixed and turn your heat onto low so we don't need to use a double board a double boiler as long as you keep it on lower minimum you're good if you start to see any white streaking take it off the heat immediately so you're just going to continue to stir this until the sugar and everything is dissolved okay so i've been stirring on low heat here for about 10 minutes we're pretty much done so you look at the bottom there and you can see it's it's nice and clear and when you stream it it looks clear so now that portion is done we are going to get our unflavored gelatin now that our jello and our corn syrup and that is done we are now turned off our heat this is when we're going to add in our citric acid uh so a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and again citric acid is what prevents your sugar from crystallizing right essentially it's an acid and it continues to melt things there is such a science and chemistry with sugar and water and acids and stuff it's like wow mind blowing so quarter teaspoon of citric acid in there give her a little gentle stir so next goes in our unflavored gelatin what i like to do is to cut it up into little squares makes it easier to melt and so we're just going to let them sit there for just a minute or so and then you just want to gently stir until your until the unflavored gelatin is all completely melted then once your gelatin is all melted and everything is a uniform color and texture that's how you know everything is melted and night skins come together everybody's being friends in the pot now we're going to add our can of butter and our gourgum so in goes our butter half a teaspoon of our gum and i use the strainer um so that it'll evenly distribute it over the uh butter um otherwise it can clump up and as well you want to make sure to sprinkle it onto the butter part and not the candy syrup because again if it hits the syrup part it'll clump the oil or the butter will make it melt it's a pretty wild uh ingredient i have to admit we're just gonna get that evenly sprinkled over our butter and we're gonna let that sit for one minute all right after it's been sitting there for about a minute we're going to start to whisk this now you don't want to go crazy whisking because as i said too hard breaks our gelatin it is going to break it a little bit but we don't want to go too gentle because we actually have to create be able to break that oil down small enough so that it can create an emulsion so it's finding that happy medium so i just kind of get it started here so we're trying to whisk with minimal air bubbles and then we have a look and take a look at the top and see if you see any kind of oil slick if you do continue to whisk it a little bit longer and then check it again if you still see some oil um coming up to the top you see some oil slicks happening we can add in a little bit more gour gum but this time you're not going to add it directly into the pot just get your bowl that your butter was in there's enough oil in there to deal with it and we're just gonna take a little bit like about an eighth of a teaspoon and you stir it into the oil into the butter it dissolves the gore gum as otherwise as i said if you just dump that in now it'll just lump up once it's dissolved into there just add it in like soup and whisk it again again have a look so here i've got some air bubbles we have a little bit of other gelatin broken a little bit but nowhere near like when we use the um the uh pan blender much nicer so now that we have this as our base here now is when we can add our flavors and our color so this said i wanted to do lemon raspberry so i'm going to split this off to half about right so for this side i'm going to add just a little bit more lemon and to this side i'm going to add in our raspberry it's probably a little too much raspberry and we're going to add in our colors so i'm going to keep the yellow which one do i want to keep clear i think i'll keep the yellow clear and i'm going to make the red solid so as i said if you've got the white um food coloring you have to shake it up really really well if it sits on the sits in your cover it has a tendency to separate so you really want to mix it well otherwise it leaves little white dots so that might be a little too much it's always let's do a couple drops a little heavy handed and i'm going to whisk this one together oh these red food coloring that's a pretty color now because i'm pretty sure i've added too much white like i said i only got to add in one or two drops because i kind of went a little heavy-handed likely this red isn't going to set but what i'm going to do is i'm going to quick test it i'm going to put a little bit into a i'm just going to put a little bit into a into a dish i'm going to throw this into the fridge for a couple of minutes to see if it sets up if it doesn't i'm going to add some additional gelatin to that side all right so my little test here it it's setting up that was just a couple minutes in the fridge we're setting no problem now if you'd done that and it was still sticky sticking to your finger then you would want to add about a half a tablespoon of additional unflavored bloom gelatin so you would bloom a half a tablespoon to three tablespoons of cold cold water and add it to that to the solid side but we're good and i went ahead and i added my yellow to my yellow side here and now what i'm going to just do is i'm going to let them sit for just a couple of minutes and allow the air bubbles to come up to the top and that white icky stiff stuff to come and we can pull that out before we pour it into our bottles so our syrup now has been sit and set for a little bit and it's cooled off and you can see kind of that layer on top here take your strainer and just very gently scoop that out so this is the kind of the air bubble a little bit of the broken gelatin but we can get a lot of that out before we put it in the bottle and then with your strainer and you just want to hold it over the bottle and pour your syrup into the bottle dead on on that one not bad and now we're ready to cast our candies so a tip for you put your molds into your freezer before you start that way they're nice and cold and your gelatin your syrup will start to solidify right away especially if you're doing two colors that way they won't all bleed together another tip for you before you pour turn your bottles upside down put your fingers over the tips and just tap them what this will do is bring all the air bubbles to the top or to the bottom of the bottles so again helps make it much nicer candy okay then and then just fill up your molds now one thing important with your molds is don't fill them all the way to the top you want to go just just below it go all the way to the top it creates a ridge that gets icky it gets hard these are guys you're gonna look so cool yellow on yellow is tough it's hard to see it especially when it's clear so this recipe will make about um about a hundred or so of this size mold that i'm using probably about 300 of the teeny tiny and probably about 60 50 60 of the larger size all right so my gummies have set get your cooling rack your drying wrap parchment paper design your rock [Applause] and just pop out your gummies now if you can stand them up if they'll stand up better but if not just lay them down and then after about 12 hours flip them and let them fully dry out i usually flip them a couple times a day i walk by and do my flip and these guys will take about 24 to 48 hours to fully dry out and you want to make sure that you have a dry place humidity will not help your candies dry out at all drying and humid do not work together so if you do have a human place um if you can get a dehumidifier that will greatly help you out so i'm just going to finish uncasting these little guys and i'm going to go into the next step and show you the little trick with the alcohol and what that does and then how to successfully uh sugar sour coats your candies so be sure to stay tuned so this is the size of the candies when you take them out of the mold and that's the size of the candies once they dry so they shrink there a little bit there all right so here's a trick that i learned a tip that i learned and um it's gonna make your lives a whole lot easier especially for those of you guys who ship and we're having troubles with your candy sticking together what you're going to do is you're going to take your everclear or your um everclear or alcohol depending on where you're from anywhere you're 94 or up percentage alcohol put it into a small spray bottle remember the equipment that i always forget to tell you small spray bottle was one of them so put your alcohol into a small spray bottle so we want to give our candies a bit of a generous spray here and then just mix them up let the alcohol get into all candy all over and again if you can do this with tincture if you've got your tincture provided you did it with the uh the high grade alcohol and once you do that just put them out rip them up and let the alcohol evaporate it takes about 20 minutes or so and that's it it creates um kind of creates a bit of a barrier it keeps your candies um chewier for a longer period of time so i've had these guys out for about four days and see they're still perfectly squishy and gummy and not dried out looking or anything and that's what the alcohol helps to do and it also prevents them from sticking together all right so the next part is how to successfully sugar coat your gummies all right so this is the really other cool thing that i learned how to successfully coat our candies so for the most part you take them out you coated them they melt it it gets ugly we're not happy because that's because we're doing it wrong well the reason is and citric acid as i said is an acid if there is any moisture it is going to cause it to uh to melt so that's what's happening is you take your candies out of the fridge it's warmer outside of your fridge you know room temperature it automatically creates moisture from cold to warm or if you just automatically put your candies in or there's any moisture it the strict acid will melt so in order to successfully coat them so they don't what you want to do is once your candies have fully dried after a couple of days and if you do the step with the alcohol coating and they're done take your candies take a drying rack and just spread them out onto the drying rack then you're going to get your pot of boiling water here and we're going to just hold the rack over the steam just move it around so our candy's getting cut getting steamed up here and we don't burn our hands so what we're doing here is we're creating them we're giving them a little bit of a heat steam melt to create a bit of tackiness and then our candies stick and they don't melt so once they feel kind of gooey a little bit gooey there it doesn't take very long just dump them into your sugar your sugar mix now for the most part you do about a cup of sugar to a quarter teaspoon or so of the citric acid and then taste that these guys didn't get steamed and give that a taste and see how you like it then just add a little bit at a time until you get the desired sourness that you would like or you can just sugar coat them you don't have to do the sour so once they're done you put them in the bowl mix them all up get your wrap parchment paper i don't have enough room ah i so need a bigger table then just shake off your excess and if there's any ones that didn't get coated just hold them over the steam and that's it onto the rack they're pretty much ready to go they take about 20 minutes to dry fully dry out and that's it you will have your sugar coating that will not melt and there you have them nicely coated sugar sour coated uh gummies that aren't going to melt on you all right guys so that's everything i have for you today i hope you enjoyed that video even though it was a do-over but good so is you did get to learn a couple of new things and that should greatly improve your candies all right so and once again thank you so much for joining me today and i hope you have an awesome rest of your day bye",

take my life in it a fruit roll-up what's up guys welcome back today I have yet another gummy video for you guys and I'm very excited about this one because I think it's going to make a lot of people's lives a lot easier and it is going to be delicious today we're going to be doing a little experiment making gummies out of two ingredients store-bought gummy bears tincture or coconut oil so I just bought some gummies from bulk barn any gummies are fine and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to melt these down and I'm gonna add to some of them tincture and to some of them coconut oil and we're gonna see how they're going to turn out I think the ones with tincture will turn out amazing the coconut oil ones I'm not so sure about so let's try it out and see how it goes PS these are like the best gummies ever they're the Albanese brand you can buy them at a lot of places and they're so good they have like the best flavors the green ones and the white ones are my favorite so I'm actually not going to use them for this recipe so I'm probably gonna eat them while I'm melting them first step is to sort your gummies you don't have to smoke them if you don't want to but I want all my colors to be separate all right let's do this so I separated my gummies into yellow and orange purple and then my favorite ones just to eat while I'm doing this and we're gonna melt them and then add in our ginger and coconut oil and see how it goes I have no idea how long it's going to take us to microwave them so I'm going to start with like 15 second intervals and just check on them and then we'll find out how long it takes to melt them without over putting them I don't know so start with these great ones here there's a total of 13 gummy bears in here and they're just regular sized right there I mean they're a little bit bigger than like kuriboh gummy bears um but they're pretty standard so I was going bears and you guys can even see that okay so I'm gonna check on them in about 15 seconds and see how warmed up and melted they are so that's 20 seconds and they're starting to melt but they still need a little bit more so I put it in there for another 10 seconds okay so this is a total of 30 seconds pretty much melted and good to go I'm gonna add my tincture into here for this amount of gummies I'm going to do 1/2 a teaspoon of tincture so it's just room temperature you don't want to have it like really cold or frozen because it will affect the heat from the gummy so we'll just put that half a teaspoon in so there it is and let's see how well this stirrer is in if it doesn't stir it hopefully you guys can see that can you oh you guys can't even see that there we go so hopefully that stirs in well and if it doesn't we are going to add some lesson and lecithin into this to help combine it but I think that there's enough things and the gummy bears to start with that we shouldn't have any issues getting this to emulsify or combine or whatever you want to call it so that looks pretty good and then we're just gonna put these into a mold the same way you would with homemade gummies and let them sit and we will move on to our next batch so this is quite a bit thicker then they're coming mixtures so it seems like it's kind of hard for the little syringe to pull it up so that's one a little bit of an issue here so let's see yeah see we can't really soak it up so our options would be to microwave it more so it gets more liquidy or to add more liquid but I do not want to add more liquid so I am going to put it in the microwave for another 10 seconds okay so that was another ten seconds for a total of 30 are sorry a total of 40 seconds and I think they should be good enough to be able to put into our molds so I have about half in the mold then it's being a little bit trickier to put in that I thought it was going to be I'm having some trouble like getting the the dropper to like suction it up and that's because it is really thick so again I'm going to put it into the microwave for another 10 seconds and warm it up some more now if you had a lot more going there zero melting I'm like I did it this won't be as much of an issue because the heat will contain itself because there's a larger amount because there's such a small amount that's getting cooled off quicker and thickening faster and also like my dropper is like has a limited stuff to suck up so that won't be if you're doing a larger amount but it's not hurting anything by putting it in the microwave for just like 10-15 second intervals you just have to make sure you work kind of fast so let's throw that back in okay so looks a little different now I guess it just melted a lot more it's a lot more liquidy and put these interim moles okay so I put the purple ones into a molds now let's try some more but with the coconut oil let's do the yellow ones one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so we'll do thirteen of them just like we did last time and then we're gonna microwave this I'm going to start it with 40 seconds okay here's our 40 seconds melted they're nice and liquidy still might be a bit of an issue with the syringe dropper thing but if you have like one of those bottles you can dispense them with that'll be like way easier but let's add in the coconut oil so I hope you know what nut oil is what I expect to be the most difficult but I think that there's already less lecithin in the gummy bears so the oil should be able to emulsify pretty good but we'll find out so let's have it half a teaspoon of coconut oil okay we got our half teaspoon let's mix that in so so far it's actually mixing in really well that's all something I do for gummy bears with tincture instead of coconut oil because they I think they taste better but I know that most people you should just have coconut oil on hand the texture is a little bit different with the coconut oil I'm going to put that back in the microwave for another like 15 seconds alright so I did another 10 seconds I thought 15 might be too much all right now let's put these in their molds it looks like it's a lot harder using these so I'm gonna use one of my squeeze bottles which will be a lot you hear well I guess I should say hopefully it will be a lot easier you can see that like the coconut oil's making it like that doesn't like stick to the sides of the bottle that much I'm actually very surprised how well the cup oil mixed in oh my god that's so hot oh god it burns okay so don't touch hot melted candy because it is really hot and it hurts okay and this is cooled off a bit now that I've changed the bottle so hopefully it comes out okay if not I'll put it until I got a hot bowl of water or something look at all that gelatin or gummies sitting on the top there and I gotta get him down I'm just gonna leave this to sit upwards to get this to come down guys it's just it's it's too sticky this didn't really work that well either I'm gonna take the metal cap off and I'm gonna put it in the microwave just like this hopefully that works okay I did it ten seconds in the microwave it still doesn't look like it's gonna come out like this No okay this is not working either see another way that we can get this into the mold I mean like it's still gonna taste delicious I'm probably gonna have to eat a lot of this like just peel out of the bowl and stuff okay my plan was to cut a hole and squish this through but I don't think that's gonna happen well let's let's try see oh it's working okay I mean it's a little hardened now Oh No okay this is not working very well okay so the melting of the gummy bears and adding coconut oil didn't work very well I don't know why it seems like it almost got like harder like I now I'm just wondering if I like I microwaved it too many times like I don't know it just it won't come out really it's too thick to come out of anything so I'm gonna make another batch with the tincture just to test that out um again and see it's like it's definitely going to work or if it's user error and I mean it still I'd still take my get it a fruit roll-up it still tastes good if you wanted to you just melt them and then I mean this is really good little easy to get through oh look but you could just melt it and put it onto like parchment paper or silicone and peel it off after and just cut it into strips it's like the same thing it just won't be in the molds the actual gummy product mixed really well - coconut oil it tastes amazing of course you just they just happen to make sure it's pretty making the mold so still work very good I'll be snacking on this later okay let's do some more with the orange gummies and let's put some more tincture and then this time 1112 where do we do 13 or 12 I remember 30 I think and you don't have to do 13 so it's just the number I'm doing I don't know just - just what it is I'm doing and yeah you can just use whatever amount you want obviously you're really good okay let's microwave this you've got 30 seconds we're gonna do double the tincture so one teaspoon instead of half a teaspoon see this looks like it might have been too much tincture too much liquid and they might not set but you could always add more gelatin but I have a feeling these will set they'll just be a lot softer but if you want them to be able to firmer you could just add a sprinkle of gelatin a little more liquidy consistency as will definitely be easier to put into our moulds hopefully this one works a bit better I think it will we just got to act fast I mean using a dropper I probably would've been fine I don't know why decided to use this because it's such a small amount coming out already there we go oh yeah that's perfect oh and also just FYI if you buy these bottles which are really great for gummy making when you're making larger amounts not like this much died by making the tape it comes with like this I don't know if you can see that it's really really small and the gummy mixture is usually too thick to come out so I just put a different tip that's a little bit wider on there to make sure it can get through this was really difficult to use with such a small amount that I had so use a dropper if you have one this is usually my go-to option to squeeze things into molds but because there is such little amount when I squeeze it it's not really doing anything whereas if there was like this much gummy make sure when I squeeze it the pressure would push it out but because I made such a small amount obviously it's gonna be a little bit trickier I will just eat this out of the bottle later I'm just going to put the gummies that I need into the fridge probably for like 20 minutes alright guys I'm back but it hasn't been 20 minutes it's been two days so I took the gummies Oh after 20 minutes and they were not nearly hard enough I couldn't even really get them out of their molds so I put them in the freezer for a little bit like about half an hour and once they were hard enough I popped them all out of their molds and just left them on some parchment paper but they still were a little bit too squishy and too like corn syrupy so I left them out for a day and they were still a little bit too squishy Tomo for another day which is where we are now so it's been two days and they are perfect so if you guys make these just leave them out on a piece of parchment paper for a couple days depending on how humid it is wherever you live it might be a little bit different like it's not very humid where I live at all um so they dry up pretty quick but if you live somewhere very humid they might take a lot longer to dry or they might even not work for you in the first place so I'll show you what they look like so both the purple and the orange ones turned out very well you can see they're sticky obviously because they are sticking to my fingers so they are a little bit stickier than like a regular gummy but they're they don't really stick together in the bag because I've let them dry out for a few days so the purple ones had half a teaspoon of tincture in them and the orange ones had double that amount so they had one teaspoon of tincture and I thought they were gonna have a lot of issues but they're totally fine yeah they turned out very well and they taste just like the gummies did before I remoulded them last thing just to clarify um my gummies with the coconut oil didn't turn out only the ones with the tincture worked for me I don't know why the coconut oil ones didn't work if you guys know why please let me know because I'm very curious so yeah guys these turned out fantastic I'm super impressed with the results I definitely am gonna use this method many times in the future um going forward what I would do is for every 10 dummies I would do half a teaspoon of tincture so you can just multiply that by however many you want to make in total but based on what I've seen with these with half a teaspoon and the regular teaspoon they both turned out so you couldn't probably get away with using a little bit more but if you're looking for a starting point I would go with ten nine bears and half a teaspoon all right please let me know if you guys try this out I hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if there's any videos you would like to see I hope you guys enjoyed this video please comment like and

I went trick-or-treating Milky Way's tootsie rolls and I got 82 starbursts well I had 82 starbursts now I have a sugar rush and a pile of trash but this first hack turns this trash in into fashion my favorite candy bar belt for this hack you'll need a tape measure scissors clear packaging tape to keyrings and starburst wrappers trim your candy wrappers so they are all 1 inch wide you'll need about 15 wrappers depending on the size of your waist now measure your waist and add 6 inches 26 so I'll meet about 32 inches measure a piece of packing tape that length and lay it sticky side up on the table now tape down each end [Music] now starting at one end place a wrapper in the middle of the tape now place a second wrapper overlapping the first one just slightly continue till you only have room for two more wrappers now place the last two wrappers colorful side down you do this because when you fold the end of the belt over you want the colorful side to shell now cover the whole belt with another piece of tape sticky side down take the piece of tape that was holding it down off the table and trim along the sides [Music] now add another piece of tape around the whole belt [Music] and wrap the edges around the back [Music] now cut off the extra tape on both ends wrap the end you started with through both killings [Music] and secure with tape [Music] now round the other end of your belt to wear the belt put the end through both rings then fold over and go back through only one ring and then pull to tighten [Music] the great thing is the belt is fully adjustable which will come in handy after I eat all this candy or drink it that's right in this next tap you can enjoy your delicious candy haul without even chewing my milky way to go cocoa for this you'll need a spoon a mug of milk for small milky way's and a microwave unwrap your milky way's and put them into the mug of milk now microwave for 30 seconds at a time [Music] strain each time until the milk is hot and the milky way's are melted still needs more there it's all melted and it smells really good this Milky Way cocoa is out of this world check out the best part of my home a full sized bag of gummy bears and since I have so many gummy bears I'll use some to make my yummy gummy slice for this you'll need a wooden spoon cooking oil cornstarch powdered sugar gummy bears a bowl measuring cup and spoons and a microwave first pick out the color of gummy bears you want I'm choosing red you'll need about a cup of one color now microwave this for 15 seconds and then stir until it's smooth [Music] now add two tablespoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar and stir it into the mixture [Music] now put some cornstarch and sugar on your surface so that your slime doesn't stick to it once it's

lemon to get the juice now I have a kabillion of different kitchen gadgets but for some reason I don't have like a regular juicer I have the full-blown juicer that you throw the whole thing in but I figure I just squeeze it here because most people don't have one anyway so if you squeeze the lemon and place your hand underneath you can catch the extra seeds that fall out if some slip away from you just make sure you get them out of a bowl when you're done [Music] next you'll take your lemon pill strips and place them into a food processor if you don't have a food processor you can use a blender we'll go ahead and grind it until you get fine pieces continue to grind it down until you get the strip's down about this size next we're gonna make the sauce take a bowl and add the lemon juice that we squeezed earlier some granulated sugar and some of the human father Meehan whey powder can be found at most grocery stores in Hawaii you can buy it online on Amazon at crack seed stores around it's pretty easy to find all these go ahead and mix that up until well combined and you're gonna go ahead and add your gummy bears toss the gummy bears in the sauce until well coated [Music] then you're gonna add the ground-up lemon-peel lastly stir it up and enjoy [Music] and that's how you make lemon lemon peel gummy bears really easy right if you try this recipe or any of my other recipes please let me know leave a comment in the comment box below what's your favorite thing to put the Himalaya powder on and until next time Hui hold thank you for watching my mom's video", "zYgVCXcyrcI": "hi welcome to dive into light edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and to the regular subscribers thank you so much and welcome back new subscribers thank you again for joining I'm so excited this channel is kind of weirdly taking on a life of its own it's it's really really exciting but a little overwhelming I'm not gonna lie it's kind of cool when there's like you know a couple thousand people seen it but now we're getting into some not large numbers for me um that I never expected and it's like what oh but it's super cool and thank you guys so much I couldn't do this obviously without you so today I know I've got another company recipes up there and I'm always working to refine and make things better so in this recipe this is good for regular gummy bears or regular gummy candies or the sweet and sour there's really only one difference in the change for that recipe whether you want to make regular or the sugar sugar-coated and so I wanted to go for that as well as a little bit a little bit of change in the method but any one of those recipes will work so kind of how I'm gonna how I would list it is the regular gummy bears that I put is more like a condensed jello realistically it's jell-o and gelatin and you harden it up that's condensed jello and then the other candy this the sour one with the the sugar-coated sour ones they're more like a real candy so I know also how the gummy that's more like a real candy versus just condensed gelatin and I will stop babbling on now and also I've got a recipe at the end there if you want to stay tuned on how to make inverted sugar which is a replacement for corn syrup so if Kourt lake corn syrup is difficult for you to get expensive just not available in your local grocery stores you can actually make your own at a fraction of the price and it's super easy to make however it is very very finicky but I go over all of that at the end there about the inverted sugar so I hope you stay tuned for that and and check that out and I think that's all I've got for us right now I'm gonna get in as I usually do get into my ingredients the utensils you're gonna need we'll put everything together and we'll get some candies made we're getting started what you want to do is to get a pot of either ice water or set up a pot of cold water and put it in your fridge or freezer about an hour before you want to start this very important you need the really cold water to start to stop the cooking process for the syrup so just get that set up ahead of time and now we'll get into your ingredients and the tools that you're going to need all right so I'm just gonna go over the ingredients now the ingredients for the gelatin side are exactly the same whether you want to do be regular or whether you want to do the sugar coated it's exactly the same the only difference is whether you're doing the sugar coated or the regular is in the candy syrup and the difference there is if you're doing sugar coated you're gonna use one cup of sugar actually I'll go over that when I get into the sugar part you never mind about that right now we'll start with the gelatin side so you're going to need a one box of jell-o three envelopes of gelatin or three tablespoons you are going to need a quarter cup of corn syrup or you can use what's called inverted syrup which is a substitution for corn syrup I have a video at the end of this to show you how to make your own inverted sugar which I use quite often which I'm actually using today I'm just showing you the bottle for what you've got what you need in the light corn syrup you will need a quarter cup of melted can of butter 1/2 teaspoon of gore gum a quarter cup of liquid now I tend to use the kool-aid jammers or the or the kool-aid waters they're great or the Hawaiian punches are great to use as well or you can just use water you're gonna want a half a cup of liquid again you can use your juice or your gelatin I'm sorry your juice or your water for the gelatin and for this you need it needs to be cold so for your gelatin it has to be very cold and for our jello portion we're actually going to boil that and the only other thing is if you want to add some additional color and additional flavor we can do that as well and I think Oh sorry and we also need a quarter tea store sorry a half a teaspoon of citric acid I apologize almost missed that our half teaspoon of citric acid that's everything that we're going to need for our gelatin side and now I'm just gonna when we start the syrup I'm going to go into the ingredients in that for the syrup side and then if previously I talked a little bit about clear gel for the regular gelatin gummies you can actually use this now for either one and again we're gonna do all the work on our gelatin side and add this in so with regards to the clear gel if you want to use it what you need to do beforehand is you take a cup of the clear gel and you mix it with a quarter cup of sugar and you keep that to a side mix it thoroughly so that the sugar and the starch are thoroughly mixed the reason for that the starch will clump if you do it on its own or doesn't have the sugar properly mixed these starts will clump up in your mixture so that is why we add the sugar then you are going to use two tablespoons for your gelatin for your gelatin mix now this is an option now what this does is it takes your candy to that next level that more professional candy like you get in the candy store so it's not as gelatin like it's more it's a little bit softer it's more of that gummy candy versus just like concentrated gelatin and I've been using this ever since I first since I tried it I used it in all my candy now it's I love it it's not that expensive you get a large container of it and it lasts quite a long time so if you do make candies more on a larger scale or on a professional level you might want to give that a try it's excellent it's a little pretty pain to work with but I'll go over all that adding that in so for the candy syrup you're going to need one cup of sugar okay laureate let me back up here if you are making the sugar-coated gummies you are gonna use one cup of sugar and a half a cup of corn syrup if you want to make regular gummies that are not sugar-coated you're going to switch that you're going to use one cup of corn syrup to a half a cup of sugar but it's to a half a cup of sugar so the recipe is exactly the same this is the only part that'll change regular gummies one cup of syrup to half a cup of sugar sugar-coated gummies one cup of sugar to half a cup of corn sort syrup and the water remains the same half a cup either way you go that's all you need for the candy syrup side temperature cooks to the exact same we're gonna cook it to 260 all right so the equipment that we are going to need is a double boiler you don't have one no problem just what I do use a metal bowl that fits into a pot you want to add water into the bottom to the pot you just don't want it to touch the bottom of the bowl you're gonna need a second pot for your syrup you would let you want to use a heavy bottom pot it works it's better for even the heat distribution for your syrup that way your syrup cooks evenly you don't have any hotter spots you're going to need a candy thermometer a hand blender a whisk a couple of spatulas and a strainer if you've got one handy and I think that's everything that we need for our equipment I usually end up finding something that Wow's that we need but this is generally the majority of the equipment that you're gonna need so next I'll get into the ingredients for putting our gelatin portion together and then we'll then we do the candy syrup and then we combine both of them alright so give me a moment to get everything together here and we'll get started all right so let's get started with our recipe so our very first step what we're gonna do is our quarter cup of liquid we're gonna heat up in the microwave for one minute we want that boiling then with our half a cup of cold liquid we're gonna bloom our gelatin so add that to a bowl and your gelatin you want to evenly spread it over your liquid and again water or the juice I'm actually using kool-aid jam or yes or sorry I'm using the kool-aid waters you know if you do use real juice with real fruit all you need to do is to add a mold inhibitor laureen's makes a makes one and that's what you need to use if you if you use anything with real fruit in it otherwise they will mold very quickly but if you use fruit jammers Hawaiian Punch they don't have anything real in the sugar content they don't go mouldy I literally have gummies that last for months I've never seen mold on them so with regards to your gelatin you want to sprinkle it evenly and then mix it up to make sure that there are no lumps and then you're gonna set it aside for five minutes to allow it to bloom and meanwhile I'm going to microwave this for one minute so you're gonna add your box of jell-o to the double boiler you're gonna set your temperature to low and we're just gonna wait for I'm just waiting for my liquid to boil all right so we're going to add our boiled liquid yeah it got very hot I'm gonna add that in and we're gonna stir that around let our gelatin let our jello get dissolved you might need to add a little bit more liquid to it if you find that it's not fully dissolving but it takes a few minutes anyway and you want to continue to scrape all the gelatin off the sides otherwise it will harden up and we're just gonna stir that and let our water get warm now it's really important with jell-o and gelatin is the heat jello and more gelatin sorry I apologize the our unflavored gelatin melts at just hot a hot water bath if it is too hot it breaks the gelatin and what will happen is your you'll notice it'll start to get very foamy if it starts foaming immediately remove your bowl from the heat and let it cool down you also may need to add about 1/2 a tbsp more of unflavored gelatin because you've kind of broken the the you broken the gelatin a bit so it may not be as sticky or it may not be sorry gel as well so you may I need to add in an additional half a tablespoon to compensate for that so I'm just gonna continue to stir this on the low heat until it is till it's pretty much fully melted until the sugars all fully melted so now that my gelatin is pretty much melted we're gonna add in our quarter cup of corn syrup and get that thoroughly stirred in and we're also gonna add in our half a teaspoon of citric acid we're gonna let that all mix in and melt together again try and keep the sides of your bowl as clean as possible so now that our jello is all melted we're going to add in our gelatin and your gelatin is bloomed when it is nice and spongy if it is squishy at all then either your gelatin is it's not strong enough because gelatinous do have different strengths or it's old and the gelatin is just broken so you want it to be nice and firm and just break it up into pieces and scoop it in and then we're just gonna stir that until that's melted and again remember you just want to warm hot water by at this point you don't want the water underneath boiling at all otherwise your jello your gelatin will break and again if you see it starting to foam up at all take it off immediately now once your gelatin is all melted and everything looks nice like so we're gonna add in our can of butter so you know it in a quarter to a third of a cup of can of butter I'm doing a quarter cup they have dogs and cats behind me [Music] cats trying to trip me up here and then I'd in the Gerber gun this is when you want to use the strainer throw it on there and you want to evenly sprinkle it all over the top and now we're going to get our handy dandy hand blender and so you're going to blend this until it is completely all one color one unit alt one texture and that you're not seeing any kind of oil separation [Music] all right so we've got that all what we called emulsifies so what Gord got gorg um is an emulsifier what an emulsifier does is it allows oil and water to come together essentially it creates a little bubble so when we use the blender it breaks the oil particles up into tiny little part into little pieces and the emulsifier acts as a bubble and holds the water and the oil together in little bubbles that's how it all comes together and your water and oil live happily together otherwise your butter is going to separate and come to the top if you don't use that now a lot of people have asked me if you can use zanza zantac xanthan gum no you cannot it is not an emulsifier it is only a thickening agent so geurim is an emulsifier it is also a thickening agent and a stabilizer that is the other you can use lecithin I prefer Gore gum because lecithin gives it a flavor that I really don't like and I find that the Gore gum works awesome with you don't need the lesser than now at this point if you want you can add in your some additional flavoring I add in about a cup and a half full and if you want to add in some additional color I do it on this side as well I use the no taste red if I'm doing red color so I'm doing raspberries so I use the no taste red reason for that a red die has red food coloring I mean has a tends to have a bitter flavor to it so I like the no taste rent the only downfall about it is you don't get quite as an intense red as the regular ones but I would for rather give up a little bit of the color for than the flavor so I'm gonna mix that in and I'm gonna use the hand blender again just to get it full all mixed together the color comes out much nicer when you use the hand blender [Music] and when you're riding a clear gel you're gonna want to have your whisk ready and coupes and we're going to add in a tablespoon at a time and you want to evenly spread it over the top like so and then use this too and then you're gonna have to whisk it for about a minute or minute or two you're gonna notice it start to thicken up it's just kinda like cornstarch you know when you're making gravy you have to keep mixing it a little while for it to up for it to thicken up and do its thing we're gonna do and you can see how it's starting to thicken up and now we're gonna add in the second tablespoon same thing evenly over the top whisk and you're gonna repeat the same thing we're going to whisk it for about a minute or two until it's all to look pick it up so you can see how it's thickening up here I said you want to continue whisking for about two minutes and it should look nice and smooth and again all one uniform texture and color alright that side is ready is finished now we're gonna do the candy syrup side alright so for our candy syrup side because I am doing sugar or sour coated ones I am going to be using one cup of sugar half a cup of corn syrup and a cup of water now remember if you want to make regular gummies our only difference is you're gonna use a cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of regular sugar that is the only difference there you're gonna mix that together until it's up until it comes up together and your sugar begins to dissolve make sure to go all around the edges because the sugar likes to hide on the edges all right so and once your gonna have that all mixed up you're gonna turn your heat on to medium medium-high and you're going to continue to stir this until it begins to boil once it begins to boil you're not going to stir it all right the other one of the things I forgot is you want a pastry brush or a paintbrush clean paint brush so that you can clean off the sides of the pot to use a cup of hot hot water and that'll melt any sugar crystals that you've got and you want to get those off the side because any sugar crystals can cause your syrup to crystallize later on and just continue to stir it until it begins to boil Oh once your syrup begins to boil stop stirring and you're going to add in your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook this until 260 now if you want a firmer candy you can cook it to about 280 so anywhere between 260 280 you can experiment on your firmness if you want a softer candy cook it to 250 but I found 260 seemed to be a really good temperature for it and we're just gonna let that go until we hit the proper temperature now you also want to get your pot of cold water handy and the only thing that you'll do drink the cooking process is if you do see any sugar crystals form just wash them down and now while your candy while the candy syrup is cooking you just want to consider this because stir your jello side because the top part of its gonna start to solidify and the bottom is gonna be liquid because it's closer to the heat so you want to continue sure to mix that up and it all stays nice and smooth and keep it on keep it on low temperature so you have the low hot water bath keeping it melted all right so I've hit 260 take your pot and submerse it in cold ice water turn off your heat and you want to wait until the temperature begins to come down on your thermometer then you're going to place it on the counter until the temperature hits 240 well once your temperature reaches 240 you can remove your candy thermometer and we are now going to add in our gelatin or our jello and our gelatin mixture right so now we're gonna get our jello we're going to get that added in and then you're gonna very carefully stir this until it is fully mixed together your sugar the sugar syrup and the gelatin come together but be very careful because this is very hot you're going to pull it from the bottom and again make sure to get the edges and then it's this is up to you it's an optional step I do I like to use the hand blender on it and the reason I like to use the hand blender is just to make sure that everything is all mixed and blended thoroughly together [Music] [Applause] well see you like that be careful I'm gonna clean up my little mess here and then we're gonna get lit gonna let this sit let some of the air bubbles come out of it we you can work them out by just gently stirring it let it sit and then just look gently stir it again we need this to cool down a bit so you can do that and I'm just gonna clean up a little all right so my mixture is cooled down a bit and I'm going to pour it into my to my bottles my squeeze bottles that was one of the things I forgot in the utensils or tools you need is your squeeze bottles or eyedroppers and I use these squeeze bottles they're by sugar sweet sugar bowel and they've got their nice because they've got the piping tips for them which makes it really nice and easy as well as they have a wide bottle and a wider thread if you use bottles that have too thin of a thread if your syrup is hot or really thick it'll pop the top right off if after you filled your bottles if you still have syrup left just keep it on the lowest temperature just so that we can that you it'll stay so melted there otherwise it will solidify all right so now we're gonna get ready to put this into our moulds all right and then when you're filling up your mold you just want to fill them up just a little over halfway you don't want to go all the way to the top because that way it makes a rough edge on them and it makes your candies not very nice so you just want to try to make them as clean it's also you want to try not to get any jello on the edges there and you're just gonna fill up all of your molds and then once you've got them all filled you're gonna put them into the refrigerator for a minimum of four to six hours I found its best overnight so if after four hours or so II go to try to take about there knock coming out just leave them for overnight usually that usually works if they're still not going to come out of the mold you can put them in the freezer it means that you've got too much syrup the gelatin isn't working too well what you can do is put them into the freezer get them out of the molds remount them at about a tablespoon of gelatin and recast them and then if you find that you take out your candies and they're far too gummy too sticky you can remount them and add a little bit of liquid to it means that it has more too much gelatin you can add up I probably say about two or three tablespoons of liquid to it remelt it and just recast them and this recipe makes about sixty candies if you use smaller molds and if you use those little tiny bear molds you're gonna get about at least a hundred to 150 all right so these candies I had in the fridge overnight and I made lemon yesterday so you can see now I did I have found that they do stay there are better if you leave them overnight then just leaving them for a few hours and they'll come out and you pop them right into your sugar sour mix now your sugar sour mix should be one cup of sugar to a half a teaspoon of citric acid don't use any more make sure to thoroughly mix it in and that'll make a nice sugar sour mix if you just want sugar just use sugar what I usually do is for the sweet ones I will use a cup of sugar to about a quarter teaspoon of citric acid just a little bit because it brings out the fruit flavors so you just mix them into your sugar shake off the excess and lay them on a a rack with parchment paper to dry overnight now these guys also dry a lot quicker and then the other recipe and just pop them out now if you find that they're getting too sticky like this you can put them back into the fridge sometimes they do the when you leave them out they get too warm so as they get a little bit too sticky so what I usually do is take out one mold at a time and do them and that's it you'll continue doing that until they're all are all coated and just lay them out on the rack to dry overnight and those are your sugar or your sugar sour coated candies your sugar soda yeah cannabutter gummy and I just want to go for also a couple of things with regards to molds when you get brand news if you get brand-new silicone molds what I recommend to do is to cut to season them so I use a spray the spray cooking spray I spray it on let them sit for 20 minutes and then rinse them in hot water I don't use soap on them again but I want to rinse off all the excess cooking spray and then that kick that that cures them which is nice I found that red silicone mold do not work well for some reason they're thicker and I can never get anything out of them so I tend to stay away from red silicone molds I found the blues Browns and that work great but red mm-hmm does not work Oh to make inverted sugar replacement for corn syrup you need two cups of white sugar one cup of water and a quarter cup or sorry a quarter teaspoon of citric acid you're gonna need a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush brand new one will be better in a glass of hot hot water we're going to need a pot you want your pot to be super clean there cannot be even a speck of dust or dirt in your pot because it will cause your syrup to crystallize now you want a spatula and your candy thermometer that's pretty much all you need so to get started we're gonna get started in just one moment all right so we are gonna combine we're gonna put in our sugar or 1 cup of water and our quarter teaspoon of citric acid and we're gonna stir that till the biggest sugar begins to dissolve and any sugar crystals that are on the side you want to make sure to wash down we'll do that in a minute and if I change you see anything in your sugar at all any dust or any little particles whatsoever make sure that they come out because I said anything at all in your sugar will cause it to crystallize and sometimes things happen you get little little dust or little pieces of stuff I said then wash down any sugar crystals off of the side and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high you want to make sure that your pot is always in the center of the burner so that you're getting proper even heat distribution not where your sugar is cooks prop evenly and so we're gonna continue to stir this until our syrup starts to boil the moment it begins to boil you're gonna stop stirring it stirring once it starts boiling will actually cause your syrup to crystallize and we need to avoid that at all costs so just continue stirring until it begins to boil and wash down and in between keep the washing down the sides of your pot for any sugar crystals whatsoever like literally one crystal will cause your your syrup to crystallize so although it's really easy to make it is very finicky when you're stirring it's also very important to take your spatula and go right around the edge of the pot the sugar likes to settle in on the edges so you want to make sure that nothing's sitting because otherwise if it sits to the bottom it will will stick and cause you problems so the reason why inverted sugar is so finicky and while any crib one single crystal or dust will cause it to crystallize because what we're making is a what's called a supersaturated solution so I don't know if you remember science class see that science stuff does come back to you if you you made saturated solutions and supersaturated solutions where you add a saturated solution is where you have water in salt you have us salt to its maximum saturation point in its water once you go one crystal beyond that it becomes what's called a supersaturated solution and that is what we're making here because we start out first of all with a saturated solution the two cups - 1 cup of water tea cups of sugar - 1 cup of water creates a super create a saturated solution by cooking off the water we are now gonna have more sugar content than your water which then creates your supersaturated solution there you go science for the day you've learned your something new you're done oh sorry one thing I did forget is you're going to need the lid for your pot mine as you can see this one is too big for it if you don't have the right lid no big deal just use them flipped over they work just as good so you definitely need the lid to your pot because once we stop cooking this we're gonna put the lid on it immediately now as soon as it starts to boiling you're gonna stop stirring it you're not going to stir it anymore from this point on you're going to add your candy thermometer and we are gonna cook the syrup to 230 for between 234 and 237 if you want a little bit of a looser syrup then 234 if you want it a little bit thicker than 237 but you're not gonna go beyond that and the only thing now that we're gonna do through the cooking process is wash down the sides of any sugar crystals form that it's the only thing you want to make sure that's equal that's it that we're going to do through the process so keep an eye on the thermometer goes fairly quickly don't walk away don't go be hitting the bong or anything silly like that and as I said as soon as it hits 234 you're gonna wash down any crystals that may be on the sides and then we remove it immediately from the heat place the lid on it and put it on your counter or a stone block and you're not going to touch it again until it's room temperature it is very important that it doesn't get agitated or moved in its cooling process because any agitation again can cause it to crystallize now if your sugar does start to crystallize at any point not a big not a huge deal put it on low heat re melted and it should be fine so as it's boiling while it's boiling into all the sugar melts the crystals can splash up onto the side so said just keep a very close eye and if you've got which imma call it screws here normally there's little bolts here on your pot where the handle make sure to clean around there because the sugar likes to hide in on those and the sugar also will gather behind the thermometer but I only tend to move that one time near the end of the cooking process because as I said you don't want to be agitating your sugar at all so when my syrup gets close to to 29 to 30 is when I will gently move the candy thermometer and wash the crystals off in and behind mat and then gently move it back all right so my temperatures now at 234 I like to actually let mine go to about 237 I like it a little bit thicker so at about 236 I'm gonna pull it because your sugar does still tend to and continue to increase once you pull it off the heat so we're at 235 236 I'm going to remove the candy thermometer turn off my burner remit place it over on my back burner here cuz it's nice and cool wash off any crystals that may be there for the last time be very careful and then you're gonna place your lid on it and you're not going to touch the syrup again until it reaches room temperature as soon as it reaches room temperature you can use it you can either store it on your counter or you can put it in the fridge for up to six months and the one thing is you can transfer it to another container however any time I've ever done that I have it ended up crystallizing I guess the agitation of moving it from one container to another so I just tend to leave it in the pot that I cook it in so I always recommend if you're gonna do that use a pot that it's not your favorite so that if your it's off to the side for a couple of months you're not gonna miss it so I basically designate one pot for my syrup so I'm not gonna miss that pot if I'm if I need it for in the next couple of months and that's it for inverted sugar making your own corn syrup so this said this is I use it quite often in place of my corn syrup it's great if you do not have access to a corn syrup easily or like places in the UK that you really don't have corn syrup you've got I think it's called a golden syrup I'm not sure but now you can easily make your own well I hope you enjoyed that little tutorial there on how to do your own inverted sugar thank you very much for watching you have a great so that's my little tutorial there on a regular gummies and sugar sour coated gummies I hope you enjoyed that as always if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll get back to you as soon as they can I do apologize I do sometimes have a bit of a delay there I don't mean to but some life takes over sometimes but I do try to get back to everybody as I can and then here's our little of my little lemon and I did lemonade and or sorry kind of turned out like lemonade so there lemon and raspberry and these are there were little little puppies aren't they cute well good luck with your candy making and I'd love to hear how your how yours turned out and if you have any questions about the inverted sugar let me know and I hope you have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching and if you're new here and you like the video I really do hope you subscribe take care have a wonderful awesome day [Music]", "P_KArHdguG8": "What's the story behind gummy bears? How did they get their start, and what makes\nthem so perfectly chewy? They're a ridiculously satisfying candy, but\nas it turns out, there's a lot more to their story than meets the eye. Here's what you should know about gummy bears. Gummy bears have been around for almost 100\nyears. They were created and popularized by a German\ncompany named Haribo. Hans Riegel, the founder of Haribo, was only\n27 when he became a trained confectioner and started his company in 1920. Riegel began by producing hard candies until\nhe decided to try a few experiments with gelatin. It took two years, but he invented his first\nbear-shaped candy made of gummy in 1922. Riegel originally called them Dancing Bears\nand they were a bit larger and thinner than modern gummy bears. It wasn't until 1960 that Haribo updated the\nDancing Bears name to Gold-Bears. Then in 1978, the bears changed shape to the\nshorter, thicker version that we know and love today. While gummy bears have been a popular candy\nin Germany since the 1920s, it took many decades before they became widely known and loved\nin the United States. According to Bon Appetit, U.S. high school\nteachers in the 1970s would bring gummy bears into their German language classrooms so students\ncould try snacks from Germany. As more Americans were introduced to the tasty\ntreats, candy companies knew it was time to jump on the gummy bear bandwagon. Jelly Belly was the first American company\nto begin producing these little bears in 1981. However, Haribo wasn't willing to sit quietly\nand watch from the sidelines. So one year later, in 1982, their gummies\ndebuted in America. Other brands such as Brach's and Albanese\nfollowed years later and started producing their own version of gummy bears. Have you ever grabbed a handful of gummy bears,\nand picked out all of the bears of one specific color because, presumably, they were your\nfavorite flavor? Then you bite into the gummy candy only to\nfind out the flavor was lying to you? It happens to the best of us. According to Charles Spence, a professor of\nexperimental psychology, all our senses affect one another, and flavor perception can be\nincredibly multisensory. That's the reason why when we see an orange\ncandy, we think it's orange fruit-flavored. Keith Dannoff, Vice President of Marketing\nfor Haribo, told NPR that the company's gummy bears come in five flavors: strawberry, lemon,\norange, pineapple, and raspberry. Oddly enough, there is a green colored gummy\nbear in the mix. But when we bite into that green bear, the\nflavor is actually strawberry, which might come as a big surprise to some gummy bear\nfans. \"The red one is more gooder to me 'cause it\ntastes like berries.\" We all know that there's something unique\nabout biting into gummy candies. Next to the flavor, it's the texture that\nwe love. But what gives them that special chewiness? Well, much like other classic treats, such\nas marshmallows and Jell-O, it's all about the addition of gelatin. Gummy bears, gummy worms, and all of our favorite\ngummy goodies are made with sugar, corn syrup, water, coloring, and flavorings, but it's\nthe gelatin that really gives gummy candy that perfect, squishy texture. Gelatin allows for the thickening of a product,\nwhile still keeping a gooey consistency without adding any color or flavor. Gelatin comes from collagen, which is found\nin the tissue, skin, and bones of animals such as pigs and cows. Also, this is the reason that vegetarians\nand vegans should stay far away from traditional gummy bears. \"Did you learn that at vegan academy?\" There's always something joyous about eating\na handful of gummy bears. They're one of the most adorable candies out\nthere, and for many, it's hard not to remember eating them as a child. But what if you could take gummy bears and\nreally kick them up a notch to make an adult version? Turns out you can. Just like the magic combination of Jell-O\nand alcohol, you can make your own gummy bear shots. All you need to do is add gummy bears to a\nbowl or a cup, pour in vodka until it just barely covers the top of your gummy bears,\nand let them sit for a few days. The bears will absorb the alcohol, and you'll\nend up with plump, juicy bears that will make you feel warm with nostalgia - and booze. There aren't too many candies that have been\nmade into successful television shows. Sure, there's plenty of commercials for various\ncandies, and of course, they appear within shows, but a TV show inspired by a candy is\npretty rare. In 1985, Disney decided to capitalize on the\npopularity of gummy bears in the United States and produce a cartoon. A group of cuddly, colorful bears make up\nthe characters in Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The show tells the story of a civilization\nof bears that was almost destroyed by humans. However, there's one group that still lives\nbeneath a medieval kingdom. Most humans stopped believing in Gummi Bears\nlong ago but a young boy named Cavin [still believes in them because of the stories his\ngrandfather told him. After being chased by ogres, he's discovered\nby a group of Gummi Bears who are understandably suspicious of humans. \"I've never seen a human close up before. Zummi, do they really eat Gummi Bears?\" \"Oh no, oh no, of course not, Cubbi.\" Cavin earns their trust and they join together\nto battle the evil antagonist, Duke Igthorn. He's on a never-ending quest to steal the\nbear's Gummiberry Juice, which keeps them bouncing and gives people superhuman strength. It might sound a little gimmicky, but the\nshow actually had a big international following and aired for six seasons until 1991. When you consider the number of companies\nproducing gummy bears, all vying to be crowned the favorite, it's extremely impressive. Haribo has factories all over the world. Plus there are plenty of other gummy goodies\ncoming from such brands as Jelly Belly, Albanese, Trolli and Black Forest. The amount of gummy bears being produced and\nsold is astonishing. In 2017, Haribo announced plans to open its\nfirst U.S. factory in Wisconsin. According to the Seattle Times, Haribo said\nit will create 400 new jobs, adding to the existing 7,000 people Haribo employed worldwide\nat the time - all working to produce 100 million gummy bears daily. The introduction of the new factory was in\nresponse to the ridiculous growth the candy industry had seen in gummy bear popularity. According to Quartz, U.S. sales of gummy bears\nfor Haribo alone from 2011 to 2017 had increased to $115 million. Not bad for a little bear from Germany.

is Amir and thank you for clicking on my video I really appreciate it so today I'm going to be showing you guys how to make this really delicious DIY edible slime out of gummy beer and you guys this tastes so good I think I may have gained a few pounds and tality and who knows what else and I'm really excited to show you guys this DIY because I think it's really cool and I don't think anybody's dumbing yet but if they have I I don't need to copy them if you guys check it out please make sure to post it on Instagram and the timeyou so I can see because I would love to see also this is a club with my friends DIYs by Abraham Joseph Anthony nature's DIYs and Peter bright they're all really good youtuber so you should definitely check them out and also I will have a link for the description below what Oakland I have English for their channels in the description down below and yeah also don't forget to subscribe to get I'm not a little try and become a new member of the family I welcome you with a great big hug and let's get show know me to the videos yo [Music] you [Music] so first you're going to want to start off with some good beers lots and lots of gully bears and then you're going to want to separate them I'm just using my magical ability to separate them the jam you guys also just looks so satisfying like I don't know why but like the colors all separated and putting into piles they just look really satisfying so the next thing you don't want to do is just get some vegetable shortening you can also use coconut oil but I decided to use vegetable shortening for this because I feel like it works better and also coconut oil is extremely hard to get out of the can and also really hard to melt so yeah so then you're going to want to pop that into the microwave for about 30 seconds just keep doing that so it's melted along with the gummy bears then you're going to want to put some oil on it I put a spoonful first but then I realized you need more so it's better just to like put a bunch of oil and then just start mixing it so it's not going to go together at the beginning because it's still hot it has to kind of like cool down for it to become less sticky but if it is too cold then it's kind of like too stiff so they kind of have to be at a good temperature so then I just went ahead and did that for the recipe colors and you guys for some reason to me gummy bears taste so much better when they melted I don't know you guys try it tell me what you think because maybe I'm the only one maybe I'm just like a weirdo also what is your guys's favorite flavors my favorite flavor is the pineapple and the green apple you guys they are so delicious coming in the comments the locusts I would love to know so you guys these are like really really tasty sets are made out gummy bears and they're actually like really stretchy for being edible and also these tastes really good and don't forget to wash your hands before you do this because you're putting your hands all over the slime and then you're going to eat it afterwards so you want it to be clean and nice for you to eat so yeah so I'm just going to go ahead and just you know poke the rest of these and show you guys the texture and like just you know stretch them a little bit and some of them have like more oil it's not less oil so about right here I was stretching my orange line and then if you can tell you can see my little cousin besides take a decoration off the table and eat it and that was lastly ever solve that going there so this red one I think I might have added a bit too much oil and didn't need it enough like neat it's like you know like like roll it out a little bit didn't like completely take in all the oil so it was a bit like kind of separate and not together so I guess we just need to knead it a little bit more but it was so really cool and that one was probably my most favorite one because it like it looks really cool [Music] this green one I also I think I put a little bit too much oil too and it wasn't it was kind of like the red one I didn't need it enough and I think I put too much oil so it was still really cool because this wouldn't look like the clearest one and it looks really awesome and also it's one of my favorite flavors so I was fine with it so then I just put some ribbons on this to make it all pretty and stuff and then you gun so you can just give this to your friend or you can just like keep it in your refrigerator and if you guys ever want to like eat any of this and play with it do not eat the whole thing just eat like a little bit because me and my brother learned it the hard way but you should not eat a bunch of gummy worms and gummy bears at the same time because it's just it will make your stomach go berserk we ate like half a pack soda just so you can eat sub just don't eat the whole pack it would be so I really hope you guys liked this DIY and tell me what you think about it into the comments down below also give me your suggestions if you wanted to do like a another DIY or something and also if you liked it please click the like one and if you dislike this n probably flex I have no hard feelings don't forget to check out Abraham purebred justice and Mason's channels once you do this one a yeah bye guys I love you so much and I really hope you guys [Music]", "Nz3FOoMJAYw": "hey there today i am bringing you a product review and ketone test which has been highly requested but i just haven't been in ketosis to be able to test it so i am going to go ahead and test my ketones now and see where i'm currently at fingers crossed finally it has been so long since i've been in ketosis so the product that i'm going to test and review is project seven so um these are the sour ones i'm also going to try the regular ones let me go over the nutrition of the [Music] the sour ones for one container it's a hundred calories zero grams of fat 39 total carbs 19 dietary fiber zero grams of protein so it does have allulose as the second ingredient so it calculates the net carbs here it says eight net carbs for the bag which is high so the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose cane sugar citric acid pectin lactic acid natural flavors rice flour fumeric acid sodium citrate vegetable and fruit juice for color turmeric for color and stevia let me get the other bag okay so this one is actually six net carbs these are just the plain gummy bears no sourness to it uh one bag is a hundred calories one gram of fat 36 total carbs 18 dietary fiber three grams of sugar and three grams of protein that's weird the ingredients are soluble corn fiber allulose gelatin oh it has gelatin in it gelatin pectin cane sugar citric acid malic acid natural flavors vegetable and fruit juice for color sunflower oil carnauba wax turmeric for color stevia and spirulina for color so i'll try this one first just because the sour's probably going to be more prominent so this is the yellow one hmm i don't know if that was a pineapple or something but it does have a nice flavor to it the texture is a little bit different than um regular gummy bears it's a little bit harder it's still chewy don't get me wrong but it's not like that gummy you know it's not like you really have to chew into it your teeth do kind of sink into it slowly so the texture is a little bit different than regular gummies like you can't you can't pull it you know oh that's orange that's a nice flavor i think that's because of the pectin i think that's because of the pectin um your teeth kind of sink into it they're nice though they do have a nice gummy texture to it just not quite the same texture as a regular gummy bear it's a red one the flavor is really nice it's not overpowering but it's definitely a nice little flavor it's not overly sweet too i was kind of thinking because of the um cane sugar that's in it it would be like kind of hit you in the face kind of like regular candy but it's not overly sweet it's almost like a light fruity light sweetness let me try the sour now so it's kind of lightly brushed with citric acid yeah so it's not overly sour [Applause] that's definitely sour it's not too much though sometimes when things are too sour like hurts my gland back here it's not just a little sour i would say that the sourness kind of covers up the fruity flavor though so you can't taste the fruitiness it's still there but since it was so light in the first place it's um not as prominent because the sour is more prominent the texture is exactly the same as the regular gummy bears but um it has just like that little grit to it from the citric acid from the citric acid on the outside um i like it though but i like sour so if you like sour you might or if you don't like sour you might not like this i think i'm going to finish the bag for the regular gummies because this one we might have a better chance of it not lowering my ketones so because this one um cane sugar is a little bit lower down and it's lower in carbs so i'm going to finish having this bag of the regular gummies and i'll test my ketones in an hour okay so it's been an hour since i last or so it's been an hour since i had those gummy bears so i'm gonna test my ketones now i've changed i've been uh sanding the uh cabinets outside okay so that's a bummer i was hopeful i was kind of feeling it i was feeling lethargic so i can't say i'm too surprised i'm just disappointed if you know of a good uh keto gummy let me know and i will test it in an upcoming video but that's all for this one i'll see in the next one guys [Music] you", "WKDxAHgCcUw": "g'day welcome to todd's kitchen i've made a number of gummy recipes in the past they're all delicious all easy but they're not exactly keto so we can still have our gummy and eater too if you're on a keto diet so join me today as make my version of keto gummies now these keto gummies are ridiculously simple you just need two ingredients or three if you cut the water so the first one bean and this is the most important one for that gummy consistency is gelatine powder now this is what turns normal jello into a gummy consistency so i've got two cups of warm water so i'm going to add about two tablespoons of our gelatine mixture and we're just going to let that gelatin soak up all that water so just now that's all dissolved i'm just gonna give it a quick stir just to combine and now for the flavor i'm going to use some sugar-free jello now this just makes it far easier but if you don't have sugar-free jello just add some flavoring and say a little bit of stevia for sweetness so into our warm water i'm just going to pour in our sugar-free jello and just give it a good stir until it's completely dissolved okay so lastly i've just got a gummy mould now you can find these in most shops so it obviously makes no difference which one to use and just simply going to pour our mixture into each gummy mold [Music] okay so once you've filled up all your gummy moulds simply place it in the fridge for a good one or two hours to completely set now gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours so it's just a simple matter of removing them from our molds and look at that one delicious keto friendly gummy bear and there we have some delicious keto gummy bears now i've also made gummy worms gummy bottles gummy rings so this is certainly a very versatile recipe you can use any mold that you like any flavor that you like and it's completely healthy no sugar no carbs so whether you're making gummy bears or some delicious gummy worms either way they're going to taste simply [Music] delish [Music] you", "e7oO5yGHo_I": "hey guys welcome back to my channel as promised I'm coming to you today to deliver the keto gummies and if you are not subscribed to my channel please subscribe and leave me a comment thumbs up on the video if you like it and if you want to see the keto gummy recipe this please stay tuned [Music] okay guys back with the recipe for keto gummies I have all of my stuff right here I'm going to read you the recipe I'm going to show you what I have and then we'll get on with it so basically the recipe says one small box of sugar-free jell-o one packet of gelatin powder and 1/4 cup of water okay and so I'm going to show you exactly what I have here ignore the washer in the background if you hear it I'm going to make four different kinds of gummies of gummy bears and whatever I can but I'm going to show you what time I have I have a these are all kroger brand no they're not all kroger brand okay I have a Kroger sugar-free raspberry okay so we'll have raspberry gummies I have a Kroger sugar-free orange orange gummies I have a jello brand sugar-free lemon and I have a kroger brand sugar-free strawberry oh I have five cards actually I may omit one I'm not sure important make four different cons I like different colors so I may take out this strawberry and then I have kroger brand sugar-free line so I'll probably do a lime a lemon orange and I think I'll do strawberry and I'll take out the raspberry okay there's that and then what I have here this is the unflavored gelatin and a Kroger brand there's four packs to a box they look like this I have one more pack right here and then I have a whole new box so I'll be using that okay so I'm going to show you my molds I've got a little bit of a collection here these are for when I make keto fat bombs always use these they're small so they're not too big when it comes to the fat bomb so I'm just going to put those to the side because I won't be using those okay these let me start with these right here and these are just these tiny tiny gummies okay they're real small and I have a blue one orange one and a green one in these I've ordered all of this stuff gummy stuff off of Amazon okay now these are right here I'm ordering off Amazon these gummy bears are much bigger as you can see they're about twice the size probably and then they also have some gummy worms in there so those are cute so I have two of the sheets of those okay I've got some more things in here but they're more for fat bombs too like I have a jack-o-lantern then I have the little spoons these are fat bomber related so I'm just gonna leave those in here what I will need though these droppers these are what you use to suck up the jello in here and then it's so much easier to just get the jello in the little molds with these so also I got these right here at Dollar Tree okay it says they're ice cube trays they're pretty I don't know if I want to use them I'll make you like a test on one or two of these because they are kind of I mean they're not as these are here like really as you can see they're really and it's easy to pop the gummies out these are still you know there's still pliable but I don't know how good a gummy would pop out of these so I may try like one flamingo and then next time I make them on there if I like them or not so if if they don't work good for that I'll just use them as ice cube trays they are adorable so okay so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of water it ready and we'll get it in my pan I'm gonna change my camera angle and then we'll take it from there so I'll be right back okay guys I'm just put a fourth of a cup of water in here I've got the Stowe bottle on and I'm going to start out with orange so I'm gonna make this packet of orange jell-o in here okay pan quite big actually and then I'm gonna need this pocket a regular jello in here okay so what I'm gonna do is get these stirred up okay so I knocked my tripod over okay so hope you can see this yeah I'm getting this going it says to stir it says it'll thicken up a bit but the end whenever everything gets dissolved it will get thinner so that's what I'm going to do okay I got it up on half probably not the best idea in the world especially since this pans a little big anyway this is okay so yeah it does seem a little thick right now I've made this before it's been a while I can't really really remember I made it in a smaller pot though so play the better I'll be able to so sorry if you hear background noise okay it's almost there I just have to do it for just like a couple of minutes trying to get all this down through here I don't know why I grabbed this big of a pan I think I'll switch out forever for the rest of this what I'm gonna do though is I'm gonna go ahead and get all of the jello ready and in a bowl and then I just don't know how I feel about this we'll see we'll see how this one turns out just because I don't know it's thick it seems really thick I don't remember it being that thick before so I'm just trying to make sure everything is dissolved it looks like it is so what I'll do is get this poured in a bowl and what I'm gonna do is put you on pause but I will be back when I have all four jell-o's made and sitting with my molds so I can show you how I'll fill them up and everything okay so I'm gonna put you on pause I'll be back with the jello in the bowls okay guys I'm back what I've done is went ahead and made the red and the orange and I want to fill I'm gonna fill these up and then I'll show you and then I'll go ahead and make the green and the yellow and then we'll do those next so I'm just going to have a variety so what I'll do is I'll produce insert some background music here and I'm just going to go ahead and fill these up without talking [Music] okay guys I made ultimate mistake there of not putting the gummy container here on a like a cookie sheet or something like that but this right here worked good I did not spill any if you just have like one of these little cutting container thing or cutting boards you can slide it right under if you forget like I did and just get it on the cookie sheet so what I'm going to do is go ahead and get another cookie sheet because I feel like I'm gonna need one more mold so I'm gonna get that one on the cookie sheet first and especially since I'm gonna do one tester of those so I'm up high just do like this one right here so I'll be right back okay guys I'm back I have made the lemon jello I have it ready for the molds I've made the lime jello also ready for the molds so what I'm going to do I got these I got this on a pan cuz I know I'm gonna need some more of these and I've got the Flamingo there so I can do the test one so what I'm gonna do is I'll probably put some background music on and just be quiet while I'm filling these up [Music] okay guys I have got everything filled up now so what I'm going to do is get everything in the refrigerator and when everything is nice and set I'll be back to show you how I get the mole or get the gummi bears out of the molds one thing I want to say is whenever you are filling up the molds the less bubbles that you have the better if I had a toothpick I prayed pop some of those bubbles I'm just gonna see if I can get some of these bubbles pop because it's just better if you don't have any bubbles in there it's a couple of bubbles but not a whole lot actually not a whole lot at all so I'm just better if you can't if you don't have them so okay and what I did I didn't have enough Millan left so I did a lemon lung flamingo so we'll see how that turns out we'll see if I'm able to get it out or not so anyway I will be back to show you the finished product okay guys I am back and I think that these are ready to be popped out so hopefully they are so what I'm gonna do is to show you how to do it see here they are they're all in here so basically what you do is turn these things inside out just like that push them right up through there what I'm gonna do I'm putting them all on this plate this so I can get a really pretty thumbnail see how they pop out perfectly you can see wherever the camera is Yam they're adorable so my whole family is kind of excited I'll have a feeling I won't get too many of my keto gummies but that's alright that's alright I'm anxious to see how the Flamingo one is going to come out just to see if it comes out good I may make like another batch of just like regular not sugar-free gummies for the family and they're a little bit bigger I feel like they'd be pretty good doing all the little tiny ones first they come out super easy they're things almost clean when they get out so it doesn't take a whole lot of clean up after and you can see they're so pretty and colorful bad boys I can do the yellow ones next they come out super fast okay there's those okay let me get the yellows I did not spray these molds at all I feel like spraying them would probably give a strange flavor maybe I didn't spray them I do feel like you don't need to I mean I don't know what kind of molds I'll have to see when I get to the Flamingo but and you can see like if they have bubbles in them this is basically I mean you can see the bubbles but you're gonna eat them anyway it's not really a big deal so hopefully the worms will pop out good this is actually the first time I've used the worm molds so I thought it'd be cool all right there's all of those go ahead I'm gonna go with for the worms first here's all of these so let's just see oh look at there pop boop boop you didn't fall on the floor thank goodness okay there's the worm I'm gonna put them around the edges there okay there's the yellow worm okay the swarms kind of attached to the other worm there's the red worm the strawberry worm and then we have our orange worm that came out perfect and glide about that now these gummy bears are a little bit bigger as you can see this facade of the other ones the size difference they're not too much but I made a row of all of those different colors well do the tops one thought I saw one go fine come on have a really pretty thumbnail with all these on here and then I got this jar here at Dollar Tree has a really nice tight fitting lid so I think I'm just gonna keep them in there usually I use like a mason jar with a lid so I don't know I may do the mason jar put a picture at the end on whatever I decide however I decided to store them after every all the family members get to get a try them they're not getting all of them them because they're not kedo i buy in my bag of gummy bears right right right right jack right okay so there's all of those that I'm gonna go for the single flamingos let's see here we go okay okay not good check it out came out excellent so what I'll probably do is just make a little put him down there let's just make a little a hopeful meet and try a flamingos my pregnant to use a couple boxes of jello just all in the same color maybe maybe that raspberry and then just make these because I do have one more well I only have one more pack of the unflavored gelatin anyway here are the Quito gummies adorable hope you enjoyed this video if you liked it please give me a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos like this and leave me a comment if you are going to make some of these bad boys there's a whole bunch of different flavorings you can use if you choose to use like the unsweetened jello and stuff like that so yeah like and you can use even T to make to make it my not sure how to do that I haven't done it before I'd like to try anyway why didn't answer okay guys thank you for watching I'm gonna put a video up picture up at the end on how I ended up storing these so thank you for watching", "uBlyb3dh02U": "good afternoon we're going to make some THC infused gummies first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "JTteMO4GQbM": "Oi Everybody, Juliana here!  Today we're making\u00a0delicious and super fun gummy bear cookies. They're so tasty, look amazing and are perfect\u00a0for this holiday season.  So, let's bake!  This cookie\u00a0\u00a0dough is super simple.  All you need to do is mix\u00a0240 g of butter with 150 g of sugar and\u00a05 g of salt.  I add my salt with the butter and\u00a0sugar. I think it gives the cookie the right balance\u00a0of sweetness. \u00a0Mix until creamy and a lighter colour.\u00a0 Over medium to high speed.   Add one beaten egg,  and one tsp of vanilla paste or extract.\u00a0\u00a0 Mix until well combined.  Add 440 g of\u00a0flour and mix over low speed until combined.\u00a0 Don't over mix it, this part needs to be\u00a0\nreally gentle so you don't get hard cookies. Press the dough over your table or cooking station,\u00a0making it flat, and cover it with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Bring the dough from the fridge and, between two pieces of parchment paper,\u00a0\u00a0 roll the dough until it's\u00a0about a half a cm thick.\u00a0\u00a0 Cut using cookie cutters.  I'm using\u00a0a star shape, Christmas Tree and a circle. You need to use the cutters\u00a0where you also have the exact\u00a0shapes but smaller,  so you\u00a0can cut out to the middle. If the dough gets too soft, put it in the fridge to firm before removing the smaller cutter. Roll out the remaining dough again. Put all cookies into the freezer for\u00a0\nabout 10 to 20 minutes until they get\u00a0\u00a0 really hard and pre-heat your oven. For the\u00a0gummy bear candies, I like to use the sour ones, Which gives the cookies a nice tartness\u00a0\nthat balances well with the sweetness.\u00a0\u00a0 Pick the colours of gummy bears you want. I'm using some holiday colours. Cutting them will help them melt and spread\u00a0better. This will also help you fill all your edges. Take the dough from the freezer\u00a0and separate your cookies. Roll all the remaining dough again.  Bake the\u00a0cookies for about seven minutes until you see\u00a0the bottoms start to get lightly golden. Add the gummy bears in the centre of the cookies.  Add the thinner pieces at the\u00a0edges so they spread it evenly. Put them back in the oven and bake them for\u00a0another 5 minutes, until the bears are all melted. And the cookies are lightly golden on the top. You can also use a wooden stick to spread them and mix up the colours more if you want. You can check while they're baking\u00a0if the centres are too shallow,\u00a0\u00a0 and can add more gummies, it depends on\u00a0the way you shape them, so be aware. After the cookies are ready let them\u00a0\ncool completely before moving them. When the cookies are cool, they will remove\u00a0easily leaving you with a perfect cookie. These holiday gummy bear cookies\u00a0are perfect for any occasion, and bring amazing colour and flavours to your\u00a0table.  Fresh, tasty and an unexpected sour punch. Anyone who is lucky enough to try one, will just love them.  I hope you loved this recipe.\u00a0\u00a0 For more amazing recipes and food adventures, don't forget to like and subscribe to the channel.

Tchau!", "NiaPli8UDB0": "welcome to episode 4 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tynan Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist and today we're gonna make flavored candy also known as Jolly Ranchers this episode is sponsored by fat bull and the new ill-mannered film series custom agents check it out on our channel in our playlist section the following are the ingredients you'll need to make the candies okay today's ingredients are sugar light corn syrup flavored oil food coloring water vegetable oil Keith and confectioner sugar for this recipe will be using Keith if you'd like to learn how to deke are pure Keith you can go ahead and watch episode 3 this Keith is from this tangerine dream are you high for today's recipe what you'll need is a candy thermometer a pastry brush and several spatulas I prefer silicon some candy mullets metal measuring spoons and a large saucepan start with your large saucepan our first ingredient is 2 cups of sugar and I like to sift the sugar in case there are any large lumps that's annoying next we'll add 3/4 cups of water which I've already pre-measured here for this next part I recommend you pre grease your container with a little bit of vegetable oil spray that way the corn syrup won't stick to it and you'll get the correct measurement oh yeah got any grease yes I also recommend you do this with your spatula as well and your measuring tool I'm just gonna use this to make sure it's all coated okie dokie for this we're using a 1/3 measuring cup all of the tools have been sprayed with vegetable oil now we're going to measure out the light corn syrup we need 2/3 of a cup so we'll measure 1/3 of a cup twice you can see that the syrup is not sticking normally you have to fight for it to come out we're gonna do this again now that we've measured out our corn syrup we'll just add it to the rest of the ingredients and you can see how easily it comes out of the bowl now we're going to take this over to the stove this next part of the recipe is going to take some time so you want to make sure that you can really pay attention to the saucepan on the stove you want to watch what you're doing make sure you're not on the phone or distracted you don't necessarily have to attend to it in terms of storing or mixing it but you were going to be watching the temperature because we want to make sure that we get the right consistency for our Jolly wrenches it can go from soft candy to hard candy to burn candy the mixture can easily burn and then the taste is going to be really off you'll still be able to eat it but probably will not be enjoyable so make sure you have time to pay attention that way you won't have to start over from scratch and waste your batch you want to turn the stove on to a medium heat you're gonna stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves you can see that it's sticking a little bit so just put some elbow grease in it oh that's greasy that's really [ __ ] I said yeah it's greasy get in the corners because sometimes the sugar tends to clump up together on the bottom and then once you see the sugars pretty much dissolve you can just leave that alone we're gonna use our candy thermometer and you want to make sure that you don't put the bottom of the thermometer to the bottom of the saucepan because then they'll give you an inaccurate reading I put a little bit of water in here what you're gonna do is you're going to take your pastry brush and just dip it a little bit in the water and then I'm gonna wash down the stuck sugar crystals onto the mixture you don't want that to interfere with how the candy comes together you can see that the mixture is coming to a boil and that's perfectly fine we're waiting for it to reach 260 degrees so once the temperature of the candy reaches 260 degrees you're going to add your food coloring okay you can get this at any grocery store and we're actually gonna do the mint green color for the green apple flavor that we're doing today and that's just following the instructions on the box start with nine green drops and 3 yellow drops and then we'll see what that looks like and then adjust the color accordingly if we need you we just need about one or two more degrees some more and then we can add the food coloring one two three nine well once you've added the food coloring you're not going to mix it at all you're going to just let the boiling action mix it itself it looks like it's a nice bright green I added a little bit more yellow because it was just a little bit too much of a grass green than a green apple green I passed on grass all the time the minty green gives more of a green apple tone to it we've pulled the pan off the stove at 300 degrees we're gonna add green apple flavoring to this I'm adding a full tablespoon you want to keep all of the essential oil with in the saucepan and now we're gonna add our Keef as well now remember this has already been decart so we don't have to worry about that and we just need to get it off the paper there we go star very quickly you don't want the essential oils to evaporate completely this may smoke so I have my lid ready and because we're using Keith versus BHO you may not have the same uniformity but this came out really really good all right we're gonna lift the lid on and now you're gonna take your candy moles and spray them with vegetable so the color looks really good I try not to over pour it if you have someone that can help you they can kind of shimmy the candy tray so that all of the portions are pretty equal I've done this several times so I have a pretty good grasp on it the colors of these Jolly Ranchers look really really good they're really bright and green they have a uniform texture to it you can't see the keep at all I can't even see it in these when you pour these you want to have a very steady stream and a steady hand the higher you go the smaller the stream will be but just remember that the candy cools very quickly you just want to make sure that each one has about two-thirds full these green Apple Jolly Ranchers are for Bernadette price we'll be seeing her later in New York what would be filming a video for the new Sean price out and they have compressed show senator so they don't we'll put a link to it in the description I hope you like them you want a lot of these two completely cool for this recipe we made 200 pieces using five grams key so I use all silicone tools because as you can see the candy is all on it all up on it so I usually just run it under hot water along with the saucepan and any other tools and I find that it cleans very easily some of the mixture fell onto this silicone pad that I have here and that's actually completely cooled it cooled we're gonna stack the candy rolled trays just the silicone mat with confectioner sugar and then we can pop them out of the candy molds that will prevent them from sticking to each other I also have a container with the lid that also has confectioner sugar on the inside and then we can store them into the freezer [Music] by spraying the moles with vegetable spray it allows that the candies come out very easily you can see that there are really nice bright green the Keef is evenly distributed throughout the candy you really don't see very many speckles at all if any I like to sprinkle in between now let's go grab a sandwich bag and use it as a glue here we are green Apple Jolly Ranchers if you want to make these sour candies you can just add some citric acid to the bowl and shake it you want to make sure that all the powdered sugar is coated on each and every one of these so what I like to do at the end is put a bunch of powdered sugar on the top put the lid on and just shake it vigorously before I put it in to ensure that they're all individually coated this is episode 4 of mmm medical edibles please subscribe comment and give us a green thumbs up that was awesome [Music] I'm rolling up all your good and all your gun [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your dog you", "ggoGrOKosxI": "want to learn how to make apple cider vinegar gummies here's my recipe and pro tips on how to do just that [Applause] [Music] hey there alisa here from warriormade.com where i've written four cookbooks that have sold over half a million copies to help you get the most out of your health and since optimal health is a specialty of mine let's talk apple cider vinegar gummies [Music] with my kids running around and a busy family schedule it can be tricky for me to stay on top of my favorite health practices which is why i like to have simple tricks for all of my family's health needs and also my own apple cider vinegar has become super popular in the health space and for good reason it's known to help with gut health and weight loss but i actually hate the taste of straight apple cider vinegar and don't even get me started on what my family thinks of it there are plenty of ways to help with the strong taste of apple cider vinegar but none of them are quite as convenient or as fun as turning this tummy support liquid into a cute gummy i've experimented with these and have perfected this recipe so let's dive a little deeper into the benefits and the recipe to get you started with this awesome supplement apple cider vinegar has plenty of health benefits and gut health is one of my favorites it's made from aged crushed apples that go through a fermentation process the sugar in the apples ferments into alcohol yeast is added and then boom it's converted into acetic acid i'll get into the quality of the apple cider vinegar a little later but overall this is a really natural and clean process that leaves us with something that's incredible for our gut health apple cider vinegar helps boost your stomach acid so that you can break down foods easier by doing this it helps create an enzyme called pepsin that is specifically great for digesting meat another thing your stomach will thank you for is that apple cider vinegar eliminates certain unfriendly strains of gut bacteria which will help your overall gut microbiome and immune health your gut microbiome is basically the bacteria in your digestive system a healthy gut is a huge part of overall wellness when your gut microbiome is healthy you experience better digestion nutrient absorption and immune system response a healthy gut also has an impact on metabolic disease gastrointestinal disorders and even colon cancer on top of the gut health benefits of apple cider vinegar some also use it as a tool to help with weight loss there are a few different ways that this works remember the acetic acid we talked about earlier well it's a bit of a secret weapon when it comes to weight loss animal studies show that it can help lower blood sugar levels and decrease insulin levels when these levels are balanced our bodies are able to burn more fat because our sugar and carb cravings aren't as strong acetic acid has also been shown to boost your metabolism and suppress your appetite which can make it easier to lose weight makes sense right all these incredible benefits are the reason i reach for apple cider vinegar and why i'm making this healthy powerhouse into gummies now let me show you how making apple cider vinegar gummies was actually a lot simpler than i thought it was going to be the first time i made it i realized how fast the recipe comes together and you just pop them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then you have gummies that are ready to go when you're looking at sourcing your mold i would highly recommend using a silicone mold this makes it really easy to fill but also for you to just pop the gummies straight out as soon as they're finished so that way you don't have to cut around them and kind of try to pry them out i like this recipe a lot especially for my kiddos when i have an older son who has kind of some tummy issues and it works really well for him to get some extra good bacteria into his microbiome it really helps with digestive discomfort and it's really helped everyone in our family just to stay healthy when making apple cider vinegar gummies you want to make sure that you're getting the most you possibly can from the nutrients that you're putting in them one of the ways to do this is to really focus on the quality of the ingredients that you're putting in there for the apple cider vinegar i would always recommend looking for an organic apple cider vinegar but also make sure that it says raw and unfiltered the reason why this is important is because it's going to have something in there called the mother and that's really where you're going to get all of those great benefits from the apple cider vinegar also thinking along the lines of quality is the gelatin that you're going to be using whenever i'm trying to source a really high quality gelatin i look for a few key things i'm looking for an animal-based gelatin but i'm also looking for grass-fed this is telling me that this animal lived a healthy life and it also has a really high dose of collagen in it and with that high dose of collagen we get added benefits things like shiny hair strong nails and great skin a natural beauty boost and gut support i'm here for it alright now that you know how to source high quality ingredients let's make some gummies [Music]

second or maybe a third they're somewhere on the list gummy bears are delicious but what's the problem with gummy bears it doesn't matter how many gummy bears you eat they never seem to satiate you and they're just filled with sugar and calories because what are gummy bears really they're little tiny sugar bombs or sugar bears gummy bears are a delicious sweet treat i can eat endless amounts of gummy bears and they never seem to satiate me and that's the problem with gummy bears they are high in calories and high in sugar and they're delicious so you can eat a ton of them but they're not really satiating you and providing any sort of nutrition but today i have a gummy bears recipe that only requires two ingredients it is super simple and super easy to make very quick to make as well and you can make any flavor gummy bears that you want and these are low in sugar and low in calories so you can eat a lot more gummy bears and i'm rahul and on this channel we cover healthy recipes recipe reviews and all things related to fitness and nutrition so if that sounds good to you hit that like button hit that subscribe button and let's jump right into the recipe so the ingredients we are going to need for this recipe only two ingredients super easy super simple the first ingredient is gonna be sugar-free jell-o so this is sugar-free jello right here it comes in a bunch of flavors so whatever flavor gummy bears you want pick that flavor of sugar-free jello i have strawberry here and then we also have orange black cherry and another packet of strawberry so you're going to need one of these small boxes these are 0.3 ounce boxes and they have four servings so we're going to use an entire package of this so pick your favorite flavor what flavor should we do today we got orange we got black cherry we got strawberry i'm thinking strawberry because strawberry is probably my favorite fruit my favorite berry and i love strawberry flavored things i love strawberries so it just makes sense we're gonna do strawberry flavored gummy bears but whatever flavor that you want you pick that flavor of jello and the second and last ingredient we will need is some gelatin in this box there are four pouches of gelatin and we're gonna use one pouch so if you buy one of these boxes you can make four different flavors of gummy bears and you can just get four different packs of jello so very easy and the third ingredient is gonna be water so we're not gonna count that as an ingredient say it's two ingredients but if you wanna count water as an ingredient then these are gonna be three ingredient gummy bears but i'm hoping that you have water to make this recipe so let's get right into it so let's jump right into making this recipe first things first grab your jello grab your grab your jello grab your gelatin and grab your foods recipe will not need a food scale guys i know anabolic kitchen making recipes without a food scale is unknown to this channel i love this thing and i use it for everything i make but for this one you will not need a food scale i have a measuring cup right here and first thing we're going to do is put a third of a cup of water in here and a third of a cup of water is 80 grams of water i'm gonna measure out 80 grams even though this thing has markings on it i could just look at this thing and find out what a third of a cup of water is you might be wondering why am i using a food scale measuring the amount of water i'm using when i'm using a measuring cup that tells me what a third of a cup is well that is a great question that we don't know the answer to next thing we're going to do is take our gelatin take one envelope that's in here and put it right into our water and just let it chill let it let it chill on the side for a little bit because if you try to mix this it's kind of hard to mix but the gelatin just absorbs the water so if you let this chill for a little bit it's going to absorb the water and then you can easily mix it while this is relaxing for a minute let me know in the comments what your favorite flavor of gummy candies or or candy is for me it's definitely strawberry or pina colada flavor is there a better drink out there than a nice pina colada i don't think so so pina colada flavored gummies are amazing strawberry is always good and if anyone comments grape psychopath so take a fork or a spoon but a fork is easier and stir this up you can see there let this chill for a minute the gelatin mixes up super easily we're going to microwave this for one minute we don't want it boiling we don't want it really really hot we just want it warmed up so that the jello mix mixes easier in this so throw this in the microwave for around a minute until it's warm and then as soon as it comes out we're gonna dump our we're gonna dump our jello right in here [Music] while that's heating up the microwave let's open up our jello so if i read the ingredients on this should i be worried about what's going in my body i'll make that sacrifice because i want to eat gummy bears and it's okay so now that our jello mix is opened up we're going to wait for that thing 10 seconds left and it is going to finish right now right now right now first try get it [Music] so this is hot dump this right in here mix this up oh another pro tip if you have one of these milk frothing things do not use this to mix this up trust me when i was testing this recipe i used this thing this turned into foam a ton of bubbles came in the gummy bears did not turn out very well at the end they were like foamy gummy bears so don't use this thing use a fork or use a whisk so now that all the jello mix is dissolved in here you have a mixture that resembles lava but it smells good smells very strawberry if you have a gummy bear mold use that and put it into the mold or just get any dish and pour the mixture right into here and once it sets you can cut it up into cubes so we're going to make gummy cubes but it's 20 20 guys these cubes can be bears if they want to make any shape you want make pyramids make cubes make rectangles make circles greg you set but get a container we're just going to pour all the mixture right into this you don't need this i did it without it but i like to use a little oil spray just because why not just cause in case it sticks which it never does but just in case now that you have your container spread with oil take this mixture and pour it right in here so we want a thin layer so we can make small gummy cubes just like the size of a gummy bear so best part about having one of these is you can just pour right in really easily and guys one thing i forgot to say earlier is if you want these a little sweeter just add a little bit of artificial sweetener here add a splenda add some erythritol add anything you want into this mixture to make it a bit sweeter but i'm not going to add any because i'm sweet enough [Music] tastes pretty good is it bad to have jello raw wait there's nothing raw in this it just goes in the fridge it's not being baked never mind this is one tasty mixture so this goes right to the fridge for an hour and then we'll cut up into cubes and i will show you how these gummy cubes aka gummy bears come out so look how this came out a block you can just eat this like as is but let's cut this up into some cubes and make some gummy cubes gummy bears gummy bears that look like cubes but they're actually bears because we said so on this channel we want these cubes to be bearish so they will be bears so just cut it up into cubes but i want to try one right now they taste so similar to gummy bears they're so good and remember if you want to stop here gummy worms [Music] [Applause] this whole bowl right here is 50 calories and another tip on the calories on this recipe so it is pretty hard to know because let's go with the jello brand of jello this says 10 calories per serving and a serving is 2 grams of the mix let's go with great value walmart brand of the exact same thing if you look at the ingredients they're basically the same 2 grams is five calories so if you look at that so we know that nutrition labels can lie to us the real calories on this is somewhere probably between five and ten jello probably rounded up to ten our boy great value rounded down to five so even though these probably have the exact same amount of calories if you're cutting use this one if you're bulking use this one and you know i'm just kidding guys don't lie to yourselves don't trick yourselves it doesn't matter which one you use it is pretty minuscule and it doesn't matter that much so just use either one of these but it's something i wanted to show you these are pretty much the exact same things if you look at the ingredients they're the exact same but the calories on them are different so just a pro tip nutrition labels are not accurate so it is really hard to be that specific with your calories because even if you count every single thing in your diet the nutrition labels might be lying to you and they might not be having the accurate amount of calories because they're just rounding up rounding down we don't know what they're doing so the macros on both of these are zero carbs zero fat one protein and we know that one gram of protein has four calories so if there's one protein in a serving then there should be four calories in a serving so how do they get to 10 that is a mystery that we will never know the answer to or maybe there's some amount of carbs that that is less than a gram so they just said zero grams of carbs but when you look at the calories it's greater than five and they rounded up to ten we don't know we got to call our boy jello and ask him how he got to 10. and we got to call our boy great value and ask him how he got to five so if you use the great value jello mix it's 40 calories if you use jello brand jello mix then it would be 60 calories so we're just gonna go right in the middle and i know that there are 12 grams of protein in this and so we're going to say that's 48 calories so this bowl has 50 calories so you get a bowl of gummy bears for 50 calories and all those calories are pretty much coming from protein because there are 12 grams of protein in this no carbs no fat crazy imagine eating gummy bears instead of a protein bar so 50 calories you get all the gummy bears double this put a different flavor mix in with this 100 calories and it's just straight protein that you're getting so the gummy bears that you would get from any convenience store just regular gummy bears let's compare 50 calories of this to 50 calories of this so if i look at the back of this these are sour gummy worms and it says 100 calories for seven pieces which is 31 grams so 15 grams should be 50 calories let's go one of every color and there we go 15 grams so if you look at that that is 15 grams of gummy worms and that is not a lot quite disappointing 50 calories 50 calories the difference guys this is what i'm trying to share with you guys on this channel this versus this neither of these will fill you up that much right because it's not a lot of food it's only 50 calories though so what if this was 200 calories so you would have instead of three 12 of these for 200 calories or four bowls of this you see how this would eventually fill you up a lot more than this this is also straight protein so it's gonna be more filling than the sugar that you get from this guys healthy gummy bears we did it and taste test it's so good it's so good this is really good like i'd go crunch this bowl and i'd be super happy really good guys you guys got to try this try this recipe out and don't eat three of these eat this whole bowl instead and you're getting more protein and it's just as delicious you know that if i open this up i'm crushing the entire pack in this whole pack 500 calories and this would not fill me up this is not that much versus this so as always guys thank you so much for watching this video try this recipe out because i have a feeling that you guys will really enjoy this one i'd love to know what you guys will think what flavor gummy bears do you guys make let me know let me know down below your favorite candy and thank you so much for watching this video like this video if you like this recipe subscribe if you're new and i will

mystery sodas. We're gonna sample them, guess them and discover, something amazing. - But before that we're gonna tell a 10 word story. - If. - Dennis. - Suspects. - Martha. - Of. - Marination. - He. - Won't. - Ever. - Love. - Oh, man. That's tough. When you just suspect\nsomebody of marination you won't ever love? There's, there's no hope in that. - No I think that Dennis\nis anti-marination and he's starting to fall for Martha but if he suspects her for marination, he won't ever love again.\n- He won' ever love? - Yeah, he won't ever\nlove Martha or any woman. - Oh, man, Dennis. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's Dennis with one S. - You know, I don't know\na Dennis. (laughing) - You know, Dennis is\nusual spelled with one S. - That's very funny if you're just reading what was written. - Well, that's only funny\nif you read what's written and you said one N. Because Dennis is spelt two Ns. - Oh, sorry one, one N not one S. (laughing) Yes, I was N said S so, Denas. (clearing throat) - Denas?\n- Denas. - Denas.\n- Do you know a Dennis? I don't think there's ever\nbeen a Dennis in my life. I had a neighbor once whose husband died, his name was Dennis\nbut I never knew Dennis 'cause he, he dies before I knew him. - Dennis? - Yeah.\n- I'm not close with a Dennis. - Her name was Bunny by the way. I had a neighbor whose name was Bunny. - Okay. - Had a son named Matthew. - Wow. (background laughs) I didn't know where you\nwere gonna go with that. - Bunny, Bunny like-- - Anybody been close with a Dennis? - [Stevie] Can you re-ask that question? - [VOICE] D E N I Z. - Nuh-uh. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's a Turkish spelling. - Oh, well that's not Dennis. - [VOICE] Yeah, it's pronounced Dennis. - Oh, it is? - [VOICE] Yeah. - Dennis?\n- So, Denis Villenueve is a Canadian/French film director. - And there's one N and one S. - Denas. - Denay. (laughing) - But I'm going to call\nhim Denas when I see him. It's Sundance. - So that's the only famous\nDenis you could find on Google? All right, so you've marinated some stuff. Let's take the first ones.\n- [Stevie] Denas - All right, so these are all marinated in the same thing obviously? It, it soaked it all up. These things are freaking, pretty giant. - Did they get bigger\nbecause they're marinated? - [Stevie] Yeah, they get big and juicy. - I'm going to use a folk. - [Stevie] I'm very distracted\nby the, the book on the, your book. - My, you don't ever, you don't ever curl up with\na romance novel Stevie? - [Stevie] Well, listen, I, I read lesbian fiction on my porch on the weekends as everyone knows. But, but on Kindle, you know how, you have a Kindle? - Um hmm. - [Stevie] You know how the cover, you have to pay for the cover\nto not be an advertisement? - Yeah. - [Stevie] They advertise me straight romance novels all the time. It's like get a hint, you know? Get a freaking hint. (laughing) That's what they look like. - Because you don't pay. - [Stevie] Because I don't\nread straight romance novels. So it's a lost ad.\n- Or maybe you should try we got one right here is\nmarinated in Italian dressing. - Italian dressing (high voice). - [Stevie] I do remember my\nmom having like a Danielle, Danielle steel--\n- These are good. - [Stevie] On the bedside table. - I don't know what they are marinated in, but they are good. It's hard-- - Have you noticed how there's a-- - It's hard to tell. - In the very middle of everyone-- - It's hard. - It's a hardness that has stayed. - Is it, is that, I think that's harder\nthan a normal gummy bear or is that a normal\nhardness of gummy bear? - That's the only thing\nI'm thinking about. Oh, this is also a smoor, which means it is a Good Mythical More that was voted on by the Mythical Society. And what you guys have\ndecided that we should do is readily, are sprayed with water every time they touch their hair or beard. This was suggested by\nGinger Snaps, not the brand, the mythical beast. - The majority of you\nvoted on that suggestion. And, but the, the, I mean-- - I don't touch. I mean, I don't, I\ndon't, I don't touch my-- - Oh, you just sprayed me. - Yeah, because anytime\neither of us touch something. - Oh, we both both get sprayed?\n- We both get sprayed. - [Voice] David told me\nto spray around there. - You sprayed me back here though on the back of my head (spraying). Oh.\n- Oh. Spray him again, he touched his hair. - Okay. That's point blank. I'm getting a trickled down my temple. If you get a triple,\ntrickle down you temple-- - You keep touching yourself. - Oh. You really out of it Jay. - Let me tell you-- - I didn't know I was touching myself until I saw Ben pointing\nat Jay he's like, there. Cause now that you, once\nyou, once you wet it, now I want to touch it. Now I want to, I want to fix it. All right, we need to guess. Cause I don't want to\neat too many gummies. - I can't tell, all I taste is gummy bears and they're good. - [Stevie] You want a\nthree, two, one on it? You really, you don't\nhave any kind of guess? It doesn't make them taste\nany differently at all? These are all sodas remember. - Oh, all sodas? - [Stevie] Yeah. - Okay. - [Stevie] You want a three, two, one? - Three, two, one. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] No. No, but you've enjoyed this soda in something else recently on the show. - Squirt. - [Stevie] What? when did you ever eat, when did you have squirt? - When you weren't looking? (background laughs) - [Stevie] What? - What? - I wasn't listening to\nwhat you were saying. - It's not something-- - [Stevie] This soda has\nbeen featured on this show in a prominent way in this recent season. It's not, it's not, it's not our go-to. It's something that we featured\nin the next best thing. - It tastes lemony. - We'd featured it in the next best thing? - [Stevie] You poured it into your cereal and you named it the next best thing. - Oh, ah butter, butter soda. What's that called? - Cream soda - Cream soda.\n- [Stevie] Cream soda, yeah. - It doesn't taste like cream soda. - [Stevie] Oh boy. - Yeah, it does. I can taste a little bit\nof that. Let's, let's see, let's see the next one. Oh, I just touched my nose hairs. See. (spraying) - I kinda like it. (background laughs) I kinda like the mystifying quality. - Oh, these are, these are--\n- [Man 1] A little darker. - [Man 2] I'm going to get (indistinct) - Oh, this one is easy. I think. - [Stevie] There's something mesmerizing when you put your fork into the bowl in the closeup shot. Cause it jiggles like a jello mold, which gummies don't usually\nhave that exact kind of jiggle. - Okay. I got a guess. - Yeah. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Ruff beer.\n- Ruff beer. - [Stevie] Yap. - That was good. - It was pretty good. That's pretty good. - When I got my hair up like\nthis, I don't touch it a lot, But sometimes you gotta, you gotta do that. - I feel like a, a reprimanded cat. (background laughs) - Cats don't like it when\nyou spray them with water? - No. And that's how, that's how you're supposed to whop them. You're not supposed to beat a cat. You're supposed to spray them with, (background laugh) if you were to spank a cat,\nI don't know how you'd do it. - You think that dogs and cats have picked up on the cultural revolution? You know, people, our generation growing up\nespecially in the South, you did something wrong\nyou got your ass spanked, that's what happened. We don't do that anymore. But you also spank your dog guys. - [Stevie] No you don't know. - No, we did growing up back then. - [Stevie] You spanked them? - Yeah, if the dog did something wrong, my dad had like a roll of newspaper and he'd hit it on the back. - Yeah, you gotta-- - I'm not suggesting this. - You gotta communicate to the dog that you did something wrong. - And I'm saying-- - And, and the go-to was\njust hitting it on the back. - Culturally, we have all\nmoved on to a next level where it's positive reinforcement, right? So do you think that the\npets have picked up on this? - [Stevie] I don't know if\nthat's true for everybody. - And they're like, hey, we're staying inside now. We're getting pampered. We got it made, let's start minding. I think they've, I think,\nI think it's worked. I think it works.\n- I think word has gotten out that dogs are not getting spanked as much. I know there's some people still doing it. - What's the question?\n- I got nothing on this. - I don't think dogs\nare like sharing notes. I don't think they have a forum. - That's where you're wrong. This one is subtle. Hmm. I just bit my tongue a little bit. - While we're thinking about--\n- It hurt. - I'll let you know that, you may not know this, but you can shower with us because we put ourselves\non a shower curtain. - I know. (spraying) See. - And it's available at mythical.com. And also if that's a little\nover the line for you, we also just put our faces on a towel, which you can then touch your body with. also available at mythical.com. - Get a towel. Get a shower curtain. I got, I got nothing. - [Stevie] You're not\ntasting anything in this? This is the one of the more\nsubtle sodas I would say. - All right, I got a guess. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Sprite.\n- Sprite. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Yeah, sprite is so subtle. You can add it to something else. - There's a, there's a lemonyness to it. I do like what it does to the, to\nthe bears in general, - It makes them like jello. - Yeah. - If you wanna make your bears like jello, how long did you soak them? - [Voice] Twelve hours. - Twelve hours. - Oh goodness look at that. - Were these all--\n- That is a warm. - Were these all the\nsame color originally? - [Voice] No. - I can't even get one. - Ooh, smells like cleaner. - Hmm.\n- Hmm. - It's very lemony. Is that because the-- - That's because you\ngot a lemon part of it. - Oh, really? Yeah, let me get a different-- - The consistency. I mean, it, it's become like a dessert. - The, the-- I'd love to\nput this on ice cream now. You know how you can put\ngummy bears on ice cream and they get too hard? - Yeah. This, this does that. - You do, you soak them and\nthen you put these on ice cream. I know what I'm doing tonight. Well, I'm marinating\ngummy bears for 12 hours. - Tomorrow night, for tomorrow morning for breakfast. - Staying up all night,\nwatching it like a hawk. - I mean, this tastes like, I mean, this tastes like furniture polish. - I think I have an answer,\nbut it's based on his reaction. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] No.\n- No. - [Stevie] No, the color\nshould give you a clue. - Coke. - [Stevie] No. it's a purple color. - Grape soda. - [Stevie] Yeah. - Grape Gatorade. (laughing) - It didn't stain my tongue. - That, that's, that's good now that I know what it is. I like that. - Oh, thanks. (spraying) Okay, that was, you made it, you're, you're\nmaking up for lost time, I see what you're doing. This one didn't really do\nany colorization at all. - No it didn't. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I have an immediate guess. - Have you noticed how these don't have the hard center like the bears do? - Yeah, the, the worms--\n- It goes all the way through. - I think the worms are softer\nand floppier in general. So it-- - So they can have a little bit of a-- - Modulation. - [Stevie] Be careful you have a-- - That?\n- [Stevie] Yeah. - Oh yeah, I'm saving it. - [Stevie] Okay.\n- Okay - [Stevie] Okay. - I'm ready to guess.\n- I'm gonna guess. - Three, two, one - Hawaiian Punch.\n- Mountain Dew. - [Stevie] Yeah, it's Mountain Dew. - Oh, yeah. (spraying) Did I touch his beard? Stop touching your beard. - That was pretty good, Mountain Dew. Mountain, that seems\nlike an internet-y thing, Mountain Dew gummy worms. (clattering) - That's going to be the thumbnail. - Look what happens to the Swedish fish. Oh, my gosh.\n- Oh, my gosh. - They become salmon. (background music) This Swedish fish became salmon. - What, what kind of\nfish were they before? - I don't know. - I think we did know at one point. - [Stevie] Swedish. - I've been feeling a\nstrong call to Scandinavia. - How am I supposed to respond to that? (laughing) - I just, I've been looking\nup pictures of things. - Of what things? - Just, just the world. And I keep landing on like, ooh, what is this place? It's like, Oh, that's the coast of Norway. - [Stevie] There's an Instagram account that's Scandinavian houses\nand properties for sale. Oh, that's, that's a real\nlike wanderlust situation. - A long trip to buy a house. Don't, don't buy the house in Norway - Hold on. But listen, do you know,\nthere's only 5 million people in the whole country - But if you do, I'm going to visit it. - There's only 5 million\npeople in all of Norway. That's half as many people in just the state of North Carolina. - And what are they doing for each other? I mean, do they-- - They're also really happy. Like they're like the\nhappiest population up. - A lot of them make shoes, don't they? - No, that's the Dutch. It's a bitterly cold and a lots of it. And the whole coastline is just rocky. And then like once you\nget above a certain point, you're basically in the Arctic\ncircle during the summer, the sun never goes down during the winter the sun never comes up. - I think it sounds too cold.\n- But they're happy. - I think it sounds too cold there. - Well, I just want to visit.\nI don't want to live there. - You, do you like what's happening here? - Yeah, but I've kind of forgot. - It makes them a lot more edible, I'll tell you that. - [Stevie] Oh. - Strawberry. What was that noise you made? - [Stevie] That was like,\nooh, those are fighting words. I like Swedish fish. And I'm sticking up for the commenters who like Swedish fish.\n- The only place they stick is in your teeth. (spraying) - Ooh. - I just wiped my face\nonly to get it re-sprayed. The, there's nothing, no taste in there that's not a Swedish fish to me. - Yeah. - [Stevie] You've been\nwanting this to be a thing for the entire year.\n- Oh, coke. - [Stevie] Yeah. - I was going to guess Dr. Pepper. - [Stevie] Cherry vanilla Coke. - Oh cherry vanilla coke.\n- Oh, cherry vanilla. - [Stevie] Does this work? (bell chiming) - Yeah? - [Stevie] No, it didn't work. - I heard a bell if\nthat's what you're asking. - [Stevie] It didn't work for\nwhat I wanted it to work for. - You want us to start salivating? - There's a hiking trail\nin the North of Sweden, which I know is not Norway. - Here's some other ones, more Swedish fish. - It takes, it's called the King's Trail and it's, it takes one month to hike it. And it's just the pictures\non Instagram, mmh. You want to go? - Yeah. Are you sweating? - Yeah, I'm nervous. - You've got a lot of perspiration. He's eating the whole fish of course. - These are different. - [Stevie] I've never had the thing that these are marinated in before. - Squirt.\n- Squirt. - Gummies taste like Squirt. - Squirt is a good soda. - [Stevie] I've had Squirt. - If Squirt is like a, it's like a Sprite, but it's more lemon than lime like a Fresca. Fresca and Squirt are\nkind of exactly the same. - [Voice] kind of is. - Yeah. - I, you know, I've been missing Fresca. We, we, I, I drink Fresca. I went through a Fresca phase and, and LaCroix came along and I forgot about it. I bet you they hate LaCroix. - Well, Fresca has-- - I went through so many phases-- - Fresca has sugar. - I know. - That's what I-- But I got, but I also got diet Fresca. - I don't, I just don't like these. They're still waxy. I liked, I really liked\nthe gummy bear before. - I actually prefer Swedish\nfish without the marinade. - Yeah, it's not working. - What it did for the\ngummy bears was better. - What is this?\n- Oh, shoot. - [Stevie] It's-- - Stevie has never had it. - [Stevie] Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any way that you would guess this. It's Cactus Cooler. - What is that? - What is that? Cactus Cooler? - [Voice] That's soda.\n- Oh, hold on. We had, we had that on\nthe show, didn't we? - Probably. - Oh, no. We've never had this Cactus Cooler. - So it's a cactus. Oh, they got a nice hat. - I do like that hat. Vintage Cactus Cooler hat used on Etsy. Click on that, let's buy that. - So what is the Cactus Cooler taste like? - [Voice] Kind of orange I think. - I see $15. - You can just get it as a-- - Oh gosh. Okay. It's weird, it's itching there. (background laughs) I'd like to know how big\nthat hat is before I buy it. - Yeah. Usually you can\njust, you can hang that up. You can hang that up, man. - It says in EX.

It looks small though. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I think, I think you\ncould pull that off. - I like a trucker hat. - I think it like a, like a, I think it's, I think that would be\npulled off better by a girl, like, like a cute chick.

Orange pineapple soft drink is what the Cactus Cooler is flavored. Let's get rid of this, we don't like it. (clattering) Is that it? That's the discovery. Cactus Cooler exists. - Dr. Pepper makes it. - Is that right? - And Keurig, what? - Keurig Dr. Pepper. What does that mean? - [Stevie] Did you get\nsomething in your eye? - Yeah, water.

[Music] so all right guys so while your cannabis is the carving measure out your coconut oil so for this recipe we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to be using coconut mct oil to make my gummy bears so even though we're going to be using a quarter cup of coconut oil i'm going to measure out a half a cup of coconut oil because we're going to lose some of that coconut oil during the infusing process so just keep that in mind all right guys my cannabis is now the carb so now i'm going to add our coconut oil to the mason jar now i'm going to add a teaspoon of lecithin to my mason jar all right guys so now we're going to do is put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours add your pot to the stove [Music] add your mason jar now let it simmer for about two hours all right guys so i've been over two hours so now we're going to filter out our cannabis [Music] all right guys my cannabis coconut oil is now done so now let's start working on the cannabis gummies so before we start working on our gummies i'm going to spray my gummy molds with this non-stick cookie spray all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put my pipe on the stove and now we're going to turn the temperature on low [Music] so now i'm going to add in my water i'm going to be using 2 3 cups of water [Music] guys what i actually recommend you to do is turn your stove on like medium heat just so it can speed up the heating process and then once my water get kind of hot i'm going to reduce the temperature back down to two and then add in my cannabis oil and then all of the other ingredients so um so that's what i'm gonna do all right guys so i let my temperature stay on medium heat for about two minutes and now i can see the water is starting to boil a little bit so now what i'm gonna do is reduce the temperature back down to low [Music] all right so now we're going to do is add the candle oil [Music] now i'm just going to mix it together now another thing too guys usually water and oil wouldn't mix but that's why i added the lecithin to my can of oil so if you already have kind of oil made and it's not made with lecithin at this point i would add a teaspoon of lecithin so just keep that about all right guys so we're going to keep the temperature on low and i'm just going to let the water and the wall incorporate together all right guys my mist is fully incorporated so now we're going to add the unflavored [Music] gelatin [Music] and just mix it together so i'm just going to mix for about 2-3 minutes i want to make sure everything is incorporated all right guys so now we're going to do is add in our pack of [Music] jello [Music] all right guys so now we're going to do is add our mix to the mold all right guys so once you finish filling your modes put your bows in the freezer for a few hours [Music] all right guys so been about four hours so now we're going to remove the gummy bears from the mood so now what i'm trying to do is just remove some of the extra gummies from the gummy bears if that make any sense so so this right here i'm going to strip that from the gummy bears just to make it look a little bit better [Music] there we go [Music] all right guys my cannabis gummy bears is now done to my left is the medium-sized gummy bears and to my right is the small size gummy bears i personally like the medium size better but what i'm going to do is leave the link for both sides in the description below but um thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace [Music] you", "cvjFAGNQswQ": "has the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside okay they're very firm and albany's are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the tincture what's up guys welcome back today we're going to be doing a little experiment soaking gummy bears in tincture i know i have done this before so if you guys have seen that and i'll post a link for it it didn't work out very well and i think it was because of the gummies that i use i use gummy worms but i use great value like walmart brand and i don't remember what the ingredients were but i don't know i just i can't stop thinking about it i'm like i want to retry this and do it the right way so i got four different types of gummies or three different types of diet berries and then lifesaver gummies is like a bonus one just like i'm curious because i love those gummies um and i think that these two are going to work the best i'm not sure if these are going to work at all and these ones we'll see and the reason why is because these candies these gummies here don't have cornstarch in them and you don't want cornstarch or not i don't want to say you don't want i don't know if you don't want it i just i have a suspicion based on my experience with this stuff that the cornstarch ones are gonna not work as well but i don't know we're gonna find out um and the lifesaver gummies i don't know i read somewhere on reddit someone said they worked really well but then i read so many people saying it doesn't work for them but i want to try myself let's put these gummies in their bowls and then put some tincture on them these albanese gummies i could not find like regular albany's these are like the natural flavored ones um but they should work the same regardless and haribo i know everyone has access to these ones i feel like these are like a very common one and the main weird ones in the states you guys don't have many yards do you you guys well it's the same brand that makes all the sour patch kids and it makes um fuzzy peach and cereal shower blasters in canada they all say manyards on the package but in the states they don't say minions and do you guys have the gummies and like what does this say but anyways and then i like sugar gummies are so good my favorite is the um the dark green one i think it's watermelon so i'm just doing a few because i don't know how these are going to turn out i don't want to like have to waste all my tinctures if they don't turn out i mean i'm going to eat them for god bless but so now i just have my tincture here i store my tincture in the freezer um and i just took it out like half an hour before i don't really actually know if it's best for it to be cold or warm i try to look it up online i didn't really find an answer so i don't think it matters too much okay i'm using a dropper to pour it in oh my god i'm spilling it i don't want to sit down here make a mess okay i'm using a dropper to put it in because i don't want to pour it and then risk um wasting some and then you just want to fill them up to um kind of like you don't well i mean it probably would be best to fill them up completely but i'm not doing that just i don't know for this experiment um so i'm going to fill them so they're like mostly covered but if there's a little bit sticking out i'm not going to worry too much and any leftover tincture it's like i can just pour back into here i probably won't do that i'll just pour into a different container but it's like it's still usable right it's not like whatever's not used this has to get thrown away you can just put it back into a jar and if you notice any flecks of something in here just because i didn't do the best job filtering it because i made this tincture last night because i wanted to do this video today so like i was being a little bit lazy with my filtering okay so now we have our part one done we have our gummies and their bowls we're gonna leave them and i think it's gonna probably take about a day but i'll check in on them and see how they look after a few hours um so yeah i will see you guys in a bit once these have absorbed some more moisture oh and also it doesn't matter if you leave them um covered or uncovered or if it does let me know because again i researched this and it's mixed opinions whether it's better covered uncovered in the fridge there is not really a consensus on what's the best but what i what i was going with was i think it's better out of the fridge uncovered but don't i'm not the queen of soaking gummy so like i don't know um let me know in the comments i'm sure there's somebody who's an expert yeah so i will see you guys in a bit and we'll see how much these have absorbed okay i'm back it's not a day later it is a week later um they took a lot longer to soak than i thought they would so after like a day or two i was like this isn't going as easy as i expected so i threw them into a jar because i was like i don't know i just did so put them all in a jar and then i um let them sit for about a week and i like ship them every day now i'm going to take them out and we're going to compare them on with the sizes of the original see i was going crazy like every single day i'm like looking at them and seeing if the sizes change comparing and like honestly i couldn't see a size change i don't know so we're gonna take them out and see how it is and then i'm going to try each of them on different days without smoking or consuming any weed prior um to see if they work okay so let's first take these out and then compare them to their originals so i'm just gonna use um a fork here and i'm gonna take each of them out and lay them onto this plate okay so i took them all out and then i put um i separated them into their type and then on the bottom row i put unsoaked ones to compare them to and so far it looks like they barely even soaked up anything and i don't know i don't know if they're gonna work i hope they do um but visually i feel like i'm like a little bit disappointed i wanted to kind of see them swell and get larger um because that way you like for sure know that they absorbed it but we'll find out when i eat them so the lifesaver ones legitimately look like they got smaller i don't know how it's possible but they they do look smaller like i don't know i think it's kind of weird and then the elbow needs one keep in mind that the gummies are not a uniform size some are naturally bigger or smaller than others but the albany's like they look like you know what they look like they got a little bit bigger like maybe like a millimeter um on top that's these ones here and then our haribos over here don't look anything different at all they look exactly the same and then the main yards at the top these ones look like they absorb the most out of all of them but to be completely honest it looks they like all look very similar um i don't know uh let's taste them and let's see how i feel in a little bit another important thing to consider is that um the strength of them is all dependent on the strength of your tincture so if you have weak tincture you're going to need to eat more fibers if you have stronger tincture you can eat less so my effects or the strength that i have when i try these is not the same for it is it's not going to be the same for when you make it but um this way we can at least tell if it works and that it absorbed it even though visually it doesn't look like it did so today let's do the albanese ones okay i'm going to do the albanese ones now i'm going to have a um okay they're very firm and albanians are usually not firm they're very soft and as i bite through it i can kind of taste the t-shirt so this is a regular ebeneze and like it's very squishy and here's one of the ones that were soaked and it's much more firm it's kind of like hard for me to actually um squish it i don't know it just like almost like it's a different texture i'm trying to like get away so you guys can see what i'm talking about okay so here's here's regular and here's like they're pretty soft and this one has a tincture like i can't even like fold it like it was hard to pull i don't know if that was helpful but it's definitely firmer oh and i could taste the tincture it's totally in there i'm gonna eat the rest of the infused albanese gummies and then um i'll report back if it works and this will be the only thc i consumed today i haven't consumed any prior and um i'm not going to consume any while i'm waiting for this to kick in that way if i feel any effects we know definitely for sure it came from the gummies they're honestly significantly harder to treat which makes me like really excited because i feel like that means they probably absorbed it which is good and i also heard apparently like the alcohol flavor goes away the longer you soak it but they're like just as strong so be wary of that i can't taste the alcohol though okay it's a few hours later since i've taken the albanians and i do feel it working a little bit but i do have a very very high tolerance for edibles these days so it is what it is um but i definitely felt some of the effects so that's going to be a thumbs up for the albany's let's see how the other ones work okay i'm back today we're going to be doing the uh uh haribo i don't know why i couldn't remember that but yeah today we're gonna be eating the haribo ones and we're gonna see how they work okay it's like really hard but haribos are always kind of hard for me so let me taste the original one for comparison i can definitely taste the tincture i want to rinse my mouth up with the candy stoma sorry that's gross but um because the tincture flavor is obviously sitting on the outside but what i want to know is is it in the inside so when i keep chewing it i can taste it a little yeah it's not much firmer than the original i just tried it i'm soaked one and pretty much the same but the fuse one seems a little bit firmer i will keep doing these and then i'll see you guys in a bit okay it's a couple hours after the haribos and its same kind of thing small effect but that's not the fault of the gummies it's the fault of me for having a high tolerance so it did work um so thumbs up for the haribos okay it's really sunny so i'm sorry if like you guys can't see me i don't know okay today we're going to do the the lifesaver ones so here they are definitely very firm i have an original here to compare it yummy but um yeah they're very firm i almost hurt to chew on them but that's because i have invisalign i just took it out to eat these but it makes your teeth kind of sore because it's like having braces it definitely takes ting tree but again of course you're gonna have like a tincture taste because there's tincture on the outside so i'm gonna get water so i can do my i can see you know okay so i can taste a lot of tincture while i'm eating it but it's like is it from the outside or the inside so i'm going to put a hole in my mouth i'm going to like suck off the tincture and like try and get off with the water right i don't taste anything sure yet hmm maybe a little bit they definitely feel less tingy or taste less tinctury than the other ones do and here's the original one unsoaked very soft they're very easier to choose like the fact that they're firmer that has to mean something right some of them are like stronger than others i don't know they don't taste as tincture as the other ones did and then i'll see you guys in a bit and we'll see how these work i kind of don't think they're gonna work but we'll see okay now the main yards so i took the um here's like a regular one and then here's a infused one and you can like see they actually like look different like the color looks different i don't know if it's just because of the outside but and this one definitely soft and this one definitely not so soft so they don't taste as strong as the other ones did not the lifesaver ones but the [Music] yeah i don't taste very strong i will see you guys in a little bit uh you know these worked i don't know i don't i don't have a guess if they're gonna work or not we're gonna find out", "CYHTDnsuZGY": "ready for a fun simple treat for you and the family let's get started today we're going to be making one of my favorites gummy bears but wait we can't have gummy bears on keto correct not so fast today we're going to make something that is super simple and it really only requires three simple ingredients all right so the ingredients we're going to need real simple today i went down to walmart and picked up four of the sugar-free flavors of jell-o it's really all you need when we make this recipe keep in mind i'll put the macros at the end but 20 calories absolutely zero carbs three proteins per and that's going to give you about 25 gummy bears per serving you can get the molds and amazon i also picked up an additional mold for the gummy worms those are just a little bit extra fun so all right to get started we're going to go with a quarter cup of water in the pot we're going to bring it to a slow boil now one of the things i told you is that this is super simple we're going to go with two simple ingredients i'm going to start off with a little bit of the sugar-free orange and just pick you up a packet of unflavored gelatin that's really about all you need bring it down a little bit so we don't we don't burn it out but that's really all you need i'm going to bring this in and let's get started start by putting in our one packet of our gelatin and then we'll put in our one packet of orange stir this in and you're going to want to go until everything is fully dissolved okay now that we've got our jello completely melted we're simply going to take an eye dropper that we we got with our molds and we're going to start filling the molds it's that simple [Music] okay so as you can see the one box gave us about 35 gummy bears and gave us an additional three of the gummy worms now keep in mind we said a little bit earlier and we'll put the macros out uh shortly after this but for all that we just made for the 35 or so gummy bears and the and the worms you're talking uh pretty much zero carbs on any of this stuff it's a great fantastic substitute for when you have that sweet tooth or for when you're just wanting to have something a little bit different like a gummy bear we're gonna go ahead and fill up the rest of these and once we're done i'll be right back [Music] as you can see we're starting to wrap up what we have um and we've made quite the load of uh quite a load of gummy bears um this is going to be an actually a fantastic treat to have but i'll tell you what so we talked a little bit about um what we can do for these and how we can snack now it's time for the real talk okay guys so we've finished our first recipe we've got some good gummy bears now the part that we're going to talk about here is going to be the real talk about keto so you're going to see a ton of recipes and a lot of them are going to sit there and say that they taste just like the real thing i don't want to break your heart they don't taste like the real thing and so many of you noticed it's just gelatin and jell-o sugar-free jell-o and so many people want to look at that and say well what you basically made is you've made jell-o shots or jell-o bears or jell-o gummy bears or whatever you want to call it just sugar-free and you're not wrong and so this kind of goes into the keto mindset about how you've got to look at your food a lot of the things you'll see on the keto diet are going to be very similar to some of the foods that you eat but not exactly the same and the reason being is that we don't use a lot of the same ingredients that are in a lot of the foods and i give a really good example what we make today has literally zero carbs you can eat these things until your heart's content you're talking about 20 calories per serving of about 25 that's an entire handful and by comparison i'm going to show you something that i think is very interesting [Music] that right there when i went to go pick up our gelatin and the jell-o sugar-free jell-o at the store today i ran across as i was getting some himalayan salt which is another great keto staple there was a a little container of sugar-free gummy bears and it was kind of unique because that's what we were making today now as part of that one of the things that we had seen was that a single serving um 200 i'm sorry a single serving is 47 carbs 47. and out of that 170 calories and 5 protein but 47 carbs if you're really starting to look at it and this is where the the uh the product type and the serving size start to come into play this container was literally maybe a little bit bigger than a tuna can for some comparison and it said that in that container there was nine servings so i can tell you that before i started keto i could eat the entire container not a problem it's not that much it was probably three handfuls of gummy bears now what they did say on the label was a serving size was eight gummy bears so for eight gummy bears you've got 47 carbs 5 protein and 170 calories and so i look at that and i go okay so what am i really getting in real life food and so what you're really looking at is if you break it down you are getting about 211 carbs 765 calories and 22 protein that's what you're going to get if you eat just half of it and that's really kind of typical of the standard american diet and so when we start looking at things for keto and you start looking at how you revise the way you think about food the jello gummy bears make perfect sense you can have them they taste pretty similar to gummy bears your taste buds are going to change and they're going to acclimate to some different things but you're going to be able to go in and actually have something that you can take to the movie theaters when they open again um you're going to be able to take them outside you're going to be able to give them to your kids for snacks they are sugar-free and they're just a great alternative for when you really want something for the sweet tooth so really look at the gummy bears as something that is an alternative to what you used to eat and that's what's really important about this recipe it's not that it's a simple two ingredient recipe where you're using a little bit of water some gelatin and some jello and that's not what it's really about what it's really about is revising the way we think and revising the way we eat and how we view how we view food and so if i can have an option of having 50 i'm talking a big old bowl of gummy bears that taste like it and i hit and run the refrigerator sometimes i'll grab a handful of these things out of a ziploc bag or container and i know that i'm only getting 20 calories and zero carbs it's perfect i hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy the real talk it's the honest talk i'm still fairly new at keto we've been doing it now for about five six months and so we're learning every day and i hope you continue to stick with us and i hope you do the journey with us take care", "tFiPPb3WFG0": "hi well welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber welcome back thank you so much your support has been truly awesome so I had a couple requests there for vegan gummy bears and as I said it previously in the past I tried it with epic fail and so but I am never one to give up so I kept thinking about the method I knew would have just something to do with the method so I I thought I figured it out and the fact that you're seeing this video actually means that I did figure it out so I've created a vegan gummy candy for you so it's not gonna be exactly like a gummy bear but it's gonna be about as close and probably with you being vegan this is probably something that you're far more used to anyway and and with that yeah so I'm really excited to be able to bring that for it to you and the one thing I decided is if I'm ever gonna want to pick up somebody rich I'm gonna pick up a vegan because seriously man if they can afford the Google's groceries or that kind of food holy mountain they must have money because that stuff is expensive so anyway I'm gonna get into the ingredients here and the steps on how to do it and stay tuned alrighty so for our vegan can of oil gummies you're going to need well now I'm just making a small batch because I'm testing it so I'm not a hundred percent sure if this is gonna turn out and I really don't feel like wasting a whole bunch however if it does turn out you're if you're seeing the video then you know it's turned out so I'm going to be using 1 cup of juice I'm just using a peach cocktail you can use whatever juice that you'd like just not pineapple juice because it has an enzyme in it and that will that I know causes gelatin not to set I'm going to think it probably has the same effect on agar you're going to use one and a half tablespoons to one cup of the liquid if you want to make it more so if you're going to go 2 cups of liquid then you would do two and a half tablespoons of agar 3 cups of liquid three and a half a garb so on we're going to use one tablespoon of blue a gob syrup a quarter cup of our can of oil now I've just used regular coconut oil I haven't infused it because again I'm not going to eat this so I didn't really want to waste it and there's really no difference whether I've got THC in it or not and we're going to use Gore gum as our emulsifier so we're no further ado and we're gonna need our handy little blender and a saucepan and a spatula obviously your molds and that should be about it so I'm just gonna get this stuff cleared up and we'll get going alright so we're going to turn our heat on - so we're going to add our liquid to our saucepan and we're going to add in one tablespoon of the aghasura that's a coconut it was a lot different than butter so what we're gonna do is we're going to emulsify our our oil and our liquid first when I've tried it the other way adding everything into the agha R it just didn't work so I'm hoping that emulsifying our liquid and our oil together first is gonna solve that problem so I'm going to use 1/2 a teaspoon of our agar our sorry of our Gore gum Gorgo Mogar it's very tongue-twisting if you have a strainer like a little small strainer strainer works great for doing the gums so because you can evenly distribute it all over the top otherwise if you have to do it with your hands just try and do it as evenly as possible just kind of take little pinches and sprinkle it around like so and we're going to get our handy little hand wonder and start blending this up [Music] all right so that looks all thoroughly mixed so that looks good all our oil is nicely blended in so once you're that it's all nicely blended and it is all one uniform nice uniform homogeneous texture you're gonna add in one and a half tablespoons a Gaur now you can get Oh Garf lakes or agar powder the flakes are less expensive the powder I'm pretty sure you would use at the same but you'd have to look at the instructions for it I just don't have a hue a lot of experience with us with it and a half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons three teaspoons is one tablespoon and you're going to turn your heat up to medium-high we're going to bring this to a boil and once it's boiling we're going to turn it down and let it simmer for five minutes so now that my mixture is coming to a boil I'm going to turn it down to medium medium-low and just let that simmer for five minutes or until it is completely dissolved and you just want to keep make sure to keep stirring that alright so I'm kind of seeing some oil the oil sitting on the top here so I'm going to use the blender here to see if we can get that mixed in there because that's not looking quite right [Music] so I'm still seeing it set up at the top here the oil on the top so I'm gonna add in some more I'm gonna add a little more girl gum so I'm going to add in just a quarter of a teaspoon this time [Music] well that looks a lot better all right so what we're going to do now is distribute this in to our moles so whether you're using your squirt bottles this might be a little bit thick for the for an eyedropper but you can give it a try all right so once your your syrup looks like this it's nice and smooth no lumps you can put it into your squirt bottle oops oh [ __ ] all right don't do that on the mold learn from my mistakes all right so I'm just gonna clean up that bottle we'll get this into molds all righty so now that I've cleaned up my mess now the bottle is going to be very hot so you want to wrap it either in a some doubled up paper towel or use an oven mitt or something and you're just going to distribute it into your molds now don't fill your molds all the way up to the top like I just did there that's an oops you want to keep them just below and that's so it doesn't create an edge a sharp edge on your candies now with agar you're just gonna leave these sit on the counter for a few hours for them to set they do not go in the refrigerator whatever you do a guard is not set in the fridge it is completely different than gelatin also has a very different texture well if you're vegan and you you use agar you know what the texture is like but for those of you too new to it are trying it something different it is a different completely different texture than gelatin I can't really describe it it is a gelatin but it's not jello it's filling these up and I'll come back in a couple of hours we'll take them out and see what happens right so let's see how these little puppies came out well they come out of the mold really holy mackerel they actually worked this time I can't believe it last time they were partially set and partially mushy and they were really disgusting but this this method actually worked so I did some reading on how you actually store these because you can't do them like a regular gummy bear or a regular gummy candy and with four agar actually it says but it's served best cold so actually once they're all set you know just put them on a plate put them in the fridge for a couple of for about an hour George's for them to cool down get cold and then give them a try so I'm gonna do that and we'll see how they are now these puppies just pop right out of the mold look at that lot easier than the jello look bear overboard alrighty so I put these guys into the fridge for an hour and so they're nice and cold and you can see how much they lighten up and as well they're not as greasy so when you first take these guys out they are gonna feel a little bit greasy once you put them in the fridge that tends that goes away but as I said you can probably see you store them in the fridge I'll just wrap them up in wrap it up with saran wrap and they'll probably be good for about two weeks I'm gonna guess if you find that different please let me know in the comments that would be great alright so that is the little tutorial there on a vegan can of oil gummy bears and I'll just be back to say goodbye so that was my little demonstration there on vegan and can of oil gummy candies I hope you enjoyed the demonstration if you have any questions at all please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I will get back to you as soon as I can and I'd love to hear from you and let me know how yours turned out alright well thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it and if you enjoyed this video I do hope you subscribe thanks again have an awesome day [Music]", "mgllweLNll4": "hey hey guys and welcome back welcome back to my channel I know it's been a minute but I'm back and this morning I'm coming to you with a video on how I made these alcohol gummy bears these are actually gummy bears that I mean they're not gummy bears that you can buy at the store in soaked in alcohol so this is the mole and these are have I just finished those I'm just I just have to be mold them and I put them in these little containers whoops I dropped one I put them in these little containers like this so first we're gonna go over the materials your than me you're going to need a mold of course these moles came from Amazon they are the the silly pops molds I will try to find a link and put it in the description one of my customers actually bought these for me um she emailed me or she texted me asked me could I make these I'm like you know I gotta find a mold and she just went ahead and bought it for me so so you get four in a pan you get two blue and two yellow and it also comes with these little you get two of these little drawers you get a blue one and the other one you will need a measuring cup so I'm probably not gonna use this big measuring cup I'm just going to use these two so I have the 1/4 cup and a 1/2 cup you need jello of your choice I'm going to use strawberry jell-o I'm you need gelatin unflavored gelatin this is in the same section as the jello I purchased this one from Walmart also with the jello make sure you don't get the unsweet because my first set that I made was with us we jello and it was horrible it was hard I tried to add sugar to sweeten it up that didn't work it was horrible you and me after all of your choice so I'm going to do mango Ciroc yeah mango Soraka I thought that was making a speech containers that I store mean these are food wrecker teeners you can buy these from michaels is 2 4 6 8 10 to about 20 tensile pack for $5.99 there 4 ounce jars and and put three of these one should be molten you can fit three of these in a jar and think through what fit but you could see it three of those in the John alright so let's get started first thing you want to do wash it again so you're gonna wash your hands and so the first thing you do is you're going to measure 1/2 a cup of your alcohol and you're going to put it in a pan oh yeah and of course you will need a pee so you're going to put a half a cup of alcohol of your choice you want to put that in your sauce pan like so okay and you're going to you're going to take one pack oh I hope I won't repeat this is my first time buying this me and a pack I don't realize it came like this but oops I wrote that myself so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put this in here and you're going to let it dissolve it takes approximately five minutes for this to dissolve ten I don't have a good angle so it's gonna take approximately five minutes for this to dissolve so I'm gonna come back once the dissolve at a better angle so you guys can see okay so I'm back in it has been approximately five minutes and I hope you guys can see that where it's dissolving okay so then what you're going to do is you're gonna put a quarter of a cup of alcohol in there yeah I know this looks a lot alcohol and then you're gonna stir it a little bit more okay now it's really dissolved okay so then you're going to turn your burner on mmm now you can you can put this in and let it resolve over heat which of course it is all faster but you don't want to cook your alcohol as much because you still want it to maintain it take because we all know once you start cooking alcohol cook the cook the drunkness out of it or however you wanna say it so I'm just going to sprinkle my jello in here and it's my burner is on so once this once this jello dissolves then there to be done so it's not gonna take long for it to dissolve just a few minutes you can do this in a microwave as well um probably quicker well I don't know if it or not but you can do it in a microwave I've made jello in the microwave not alcoholic jello but I've made your little in the microwave before you don't want it to burn so that's mine that's why I'm stirring because I do not want it to run clean once I have it on medium heat so these the little jars that I put mine in so I'll sell these for $10 a jar and yeah I think that's a good price that's a big deal because yeah I think that's a good price all right it's slowly getting hot and you can mix like any alcohol any jell-o flavors I mean the possibilities are endless last week I did peach and strawberry this one that I have in this container I mean in this mold this is lemon and Hennessy and this one here is [Music] pineapple jello and pineapple pinnacle vodka almost there guys I have made some of these for my neighbor or the lady that bought the moles and yesterday she messaged me and she wanted some and then one of her friends on it's on so I'm like okay cool alright that's almost a song i'ma let it bubble once it start boiling get a little bubble to it and then um cuz normally that's how I know it's all dissolve when when it to get a little bored sore because if I keep stirring it's not gonna do anything y'all noticing a watched pot never boils if I keep stirring it it never will boiled but I don't want it to see so which this is a good this is a good pot this is a Rachael Ray pot it's a good scent so I don't think it's gonna stick [Music] and my next thing is making labels for these because when I made them for her before you know I just made them you know that was my trial so I wasn't making them to sell and then I've made some for girl at work I just put them in like little Ziploc baggies but now since I'm actually going to be selling them that's why I got these little jars and I'm going to make some labels and put on here I'm not sure what I'm going to put on the label yet but I need to figure it out because I can't just give a customer some without a label on it it looks like it's dissolved you guys it looks like it's dissolved I think it's all design so what I'm gonna do next is I'm a messy worker like all the way around so I'm gonna turn off and then I am going to pour this over in this measuring cup okay pour that over there and change my okay so I have a cord over in my cup so what I'm going to do now you can just pour it in like this but I tried that and I wasted so much alcohol you guys like my first cut because doing it with this it takes longer so porn is so quick so the first few times I make these I can only feel one for tray and half of another one well that's because I was wasting so much alcohol but now that I started using this I can feel three complete trays so you know that's like a lot of alcohol abuse so you're just going to we all know how to work these you squeeze your diaper let's put it in there now every time I pull this out like some sport out I'm not sure why so you just um put it in there and you just failure your mold just like that very simple no it's shooting out at me I'm not sure why and these are some cute little animals on here you have ducks there's um a little monkey the bear of course a lion that's a line yeah that's definitely a lion a duck so they're really really cute so I know you guys don't want to sit and watch me do that so I'm gonna finish that off camera but once they're done you just once you're done you just sit this in a refrigerator I I left mine in for like at least four hours so you're just sitting in refrigerator and then you could just this one didn't turn out so good cuz I oh my gosh I don't know if it's because I'm I had it on top of the stove when I had the stove on so guess what you guys this one is kind of messed up okay I think it's because I had on top of the stove and I left it stove on but anyway you just pop them out and they are like like here's the worm so you just pop them out after like four hours you don't have to put them in the freezer some people put theirs in the fridge you do not have to put them in the freezer I mean I guess you could for faster results but I just put mine in the refrigerator and I leave it in there for like four hours and it works perfect so thank you guys I'm going to finish filling this up and put this in refrigerator and get ready for work

and I swing right back to my kitchen and let's get cookin good-lookin today we're gonna take a walk on the wild side and work at a center make our salsa some CBD gummy bears so be sure to follow me and let's get cookin good-lookin did someone say CBD coming bears uh-huh well I sure did follow me and I'm gonna show you just how it's done let's get started good-looking so what you're gonna be needing for your CBD gummy bears is a half a cup of water now I have a half a cup of water here I have myself a container right here and I'm just gonna sit there and dump my half cup of water into my container now let's go on with the rest of the ingredients you're gonna need 1 tablespoon of the Knox gelatin so let's go ahead I'm gonna open this up always always always measure out okay it's not quite a tablespoon so we're gonna have to sit there and get another packet and so I had take that tablespoon of the NOx gelatin and we're gonna sit there and let it soften and bloom for at least a minute or so okay the NOx gelatin has softened and now let's go on with the recipe now you're gonna have to choose a flavor that you're gonna want to make your gummy bears to be but it's gonna have to be some type of a jello you know whatever it you could even make homemade jell of kool-aid packages whatever flavor you want is a flavor that you know we're gonna make we're gonna need 1/3 ounce package of any flavor so I'm choosing to use the tropical fusion this is what yours is gonna look like after we put the jello in and we mix it all up now I'm handing it off to chef Mike and he's just gonna sit there and warm all this up and we'll take it from there but basically you're gonna want everything to be dissolved chef Mike just handed it back off to me and he cooked it for about one minute halfway through we stirred it and now I'm stirring it all again now we need to sit there and let this cool down a little bit you do not want to sit there and add your CBD oil when it is too hot so I always sit there and let this cool down a little bit and then we're gonna sit there and put the CBD oil in it now talking about the CBD oil now they recommend that you sit there and you start out with a low dosage and if you need to have more youth that's when you start working your way up to the higher dosages so this recipe calls for 300 milligrams of CBD oil and also talking about the CBD oil always buy it from somebody that knows what they're doing now I go to registered pharmacist and I bought my CBD oil from him so with that all being said I just wanted to sit there put my little two cents in about the CBD oils I buy mine from a pharmacist all right I brought out my little digital thermometer and I'm just gonna sit there I want to make sure if we're gonna be getting this I want to sit there and see what the temperature of the jello mix is so let's go ahead I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna point it right on in there and it's telling me it's at 111 112 degrees so I'm gonna sit there and add our CBD oil right now to it so I'm gonna measure it out okay and now let's go ahead put it in now you're gonna want to sit there and mix this up really good and keep mixing when you think you mixed it up good enough keep mixing okay I'm quite confident I mix that all up now let's go ahead and talk about what mold you're gonna be using I know I said we're gonna be using the gummy bears so I have a gummy bear mold here and I have it set on the cookie tray that way I can sit there and easily transport these and you can sit there get other ones you know you can get ones for holidays whatnot as long as you have some candy molds basically it's what you need now next thing is you're gonna need some cooking spray now you're gonna want to spray each one of these candy molds all up now when I'm spraying my candy molds I like taking all my things over by my kitchen sink and going like this and spraying because you're always cleaning your sink anyways when you're doing dishes so let's go ahead and I'm gonna go over by my sink and I'm gonna get my candy molds a good spritz okay now that I sprayed my molds all up I'm gonna sit there and grab the gummy bear mixture here I'm gonna give it a final stir before I do place it inside they cut me bear molds gummy bears are on their way baby now I'm gonna go ahead fill my molds up you don't have to thumb up all the way all the cameras right before me - I don't so I'm gonna continue to do this off camera because the cameras really not being useful it's in my way right now so I'm gonna fill up my little gummy bear molds here and we'll be right there okay I have my molds filled up with the tropical fusion gummy bears now I'm gonna make up another package and I'm gonna continue to fill up the rest of my tray here as you see I finished up filling up my gummy bear molds that on your countertop for 30 minutes these sat on the corner for the 30 minutes now I'm gonna sit there and transfer them over to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes and I know I'm gonna get asked why was there more of the purple than the tropical fusion well that's because I used this I buy this old for from the Amish and it was the black cherry gelatin from them and it tells you to use 1/3 cup so I used what my recipe here calls for now that's the one reason why I had more than what I had when I used the tropical fusion okay I brought these out of the refrigerator now time to pop them right out of their molds I'm gonna just remove these and put them off to the side so I can show you what we're going to do so okay I removed one of the gummies go ahead I want you to make all your gummy bears stand to attention just like that so I'm gonna continue I'm molding all my gummy bears and making them all stand to attention just as they are right here and there you go folks that's how easy it is oh I see we got a roll one going again now we're just gonna sit there and leave these that sometimes they don't want to cooperate with you okay fine they don't stay in these on end the ones that aren't standing which I like to call the bad news bears but all the other ones that are standing attention we're gonna sit there and I allow them to sit like this for two days now this is gonna sit there and let them toughen up and dehydrate a little bit more and become more of them little Hasbro gummy bears that y'all no one loves so much but there's one further step that we have to sit there but they're one another one that we have to sit there and take this one more step further after this stage so like this for two days come on load guy you guys get with the program now stand up student you I'll see you in two days two days have gone by now what you're gonna want to do to the ones that are standing up is let me sit there and zoom down a little bit such as this one here you're gonna want to sit there and take it and just lay that little guy down like I have all these other gummy bears now we're gonna let them sit like this for one more day then they should be like them Hasbro gold gummy bears that we all love and behold so dear to us these should be just like them they should be you know that that should have that tackiness that the Hasbro gummy bears have you know I mean they're perfectly fine if you want to sit there and eat them this way go for it you can but if you want it to be more like the Hasbro gold gummy bears you're gonna want to sit there and do this extra step now folks I just want to sit there and put out a kindly reminder please keep these up out of reach of young little

i'm a vlogger with no views but you could go ahead and change that by hitting that subscribe button liking this video and commenting down below over the weekend i was on live and i was telling you guys you know what i wanna i wanna buy some pika pika treats you know the mexican hot candy if y'all don't know i like that but uh yeah you guys were telling me danny why don't you just make them my you know what that's a good idea so my eyes went to the store right now and i bought all the ingredients so i'm gonna show you guys what you need for this and then uh hopefully you guys can make it and then tag me yeah yeah so sit back relax and enjoy this video alright guys so first you're gonna need some chamoy you know i got the chamoy um this is optional lucas i want to try with uh you know tamarindo lucas hopefully it's good but like i said this is optional so let's keep that aside and you're gonna need some lucas mango uh you know the mango flavors bomb and honestly for your candy you could use whatever you want but you know i got the watermelon sour patch kids the reason i got the watermelon sour patch kids is because i don't know if you guys try the paleta the watermelon the sandia that has a chili limon and i was like damn that's gonna that's hella bomb that's one of my favorite palettes so i'm like you know what i'm gonna try to make it like that the same thing hopefully it comes out good so uh yeah we'll see what the sour patch kids uh watermelon you're gonna need some powdered sugar and we can't forget the tahin and not the tajin not the tajin the tahin all right so what you guys want to do first is go get yourself a spoon because you're going to need five tablespoons of this powdered sugar um guys honestly i used to eat powdered sugar called some waffles fire if you haven't tried your freaking waffles with powdered sugar go try them because it's bomb so you're gonna place the five tablespoons on here let me do that real quick because about a voyage and uh yeah it's gonna be it's gonna get messy after you put your five tablespoons of powdered sugar which it looks like this then you're gonna put two tablespoons of chamoy so let's get it guys i don't know if you guys like eating chamoy by itself but honestly i don't it's just too much for me um but i do like the lucas of the tamarindo one by itself fire that's hella bomb but yeah here's my second one all right and now when you have it like this guys all you want to do is mix it up make sure it's blended together make sure you have a lot of napkins okay i'm making a whole last mess look at the mess i'm making guys but you know what i mean i it looks like i put too much powdered sugar so all i'm gonna do is add some more chamois because you want it to be like liquidy and you don't you just don't want it to like you know you want it to all mix together because it it's gonna see liquid but no you have to just keep mixing it guys so let me mix it and then i'll show you guys when i'm done with it oh it's mixed now and now what you want to do is put it in the microwave for 10 seconds not 10 minutes 10 seconds uh so i'm gonna go put that right now real quick and show you como se mita because honestly i'm gonna explain why you need to put in the microwave 10 seconds i see no mas all right guys but after you take it out same thing mix it over again it smells good because of the chamoy fire you guys might be asking me danny why are you using powdered sugar yeah didn't sugar the candy well you want to use a powdered sugar pacquiao chamois candy for quesadilla it's just going to be dripping down you guys will see after i'm all mixing it but yeah it makes sense when you see it i mean i was like damn why do i need powdered sugar don't get me wrong i did do some research on how to make these and yeah i was like why the hell do i need powdered sugar for the yachting and sugar all right let's let's go to the next step okay so garden container where you could close it because you're gonna need to mix all the candy in it so i'm gonna open this candy and uh put some in here remember guys you could use any candy i'm just using this because uh la paleta de san dia fire so i'm gonna i'm not gonna put a lot just because well i'm gonna lie [Applause] guys so i put this many no mucho um just because i don't wanna a lot today so mas and then what you want to do is pour some of this pour your chamoy on here and then batalo trabes and yeah i see like that make sure your chamois gets everywhere guys so the chamois is going to be the main ingredient pacquiao in the candy so like your lucas your tahini and then yeah that's why you use powdered sugar cuando ya cabes is supposed to look like this fire hella good so then you start adding your tahin as much as that hinge you want and same thing with this as much as look as you want okay guys so i'm gonna put a lot of tahini just because i like my sour oh oh okay all right put that in and then obviously mix it up like that could go everywhere oh my god i can't wait to try this all right once it has enough tajin um go ahead and put your lucas the mango flavor my favorite one after school i used to buy one of these and a cocoa whoa good ass snack but these kids nowadays no salmon okay right so now you're going to put your mango right here your lucas oh my gosh this is fire okay guys asi se mira wow look at this i know your mouth is watering so my bad but then the tapas and then you obviously you shake it down look how it looks all right so moment of truth before i put the lucas tamarindo i'm gonna try it first without it and hopefully i mean it's gonna taste fire guys i know it's gonna taste fire wow oh so good guys hella bomb oh my god i i should start sending these for real man if y'all didn't know back in middle school i used to sell sour gummy bears or you know actually um i used to sell spicy gummy bears con eso le ponia tapatio lo que sia kool-aid if y'all want me to make a like a chili type of you know hot spicy uh gummy bear let me know and i will make it because i have all the ingredients right here well except for kool-aid i need to go buy kool-aid pero i'm gonna put some more tajin because same with the lucas since i already tried it like normal i'm gonna try this i'm gonna add this um but like i said guys you really don't need this i just want to try my let's see how it tastes so let me open this real quick you lego throw some in there l memories memories i haven't had one of these in a long ass time but let me let me throw some in there fire all right let's do this let's do this this is gonna be the end of the video but if you like it if you try it tag me guys make sure to tag me so you know just comment down below and uh guys you won't regret it with this sour patch kids uh watermelon it tastes hella bomb like it tastes like that lollipop sandia so all right so you guys made it to the end of the video and for those that made it thank you so much for the love and support but i do want to you know get a little little serious well i want to have a little talk with y'all just because i've seen this going around everywhere twitter um facebook instagram you name it all social media this week yeah i think it was yesterday there's a there's a situation where this orderly man got uh jumped basically beat up by two african americans and um yeah it just it just sucks i hate it guys this is not the first video i watched i actually watched another one yesterday too where uh three latino guys are hispanic um they got jumped by 20 african-american guys outside a liquor store and it's just wack it's a whack i hate i hate watching those videos and don't get me wrong i'm all black lives matter guys i stand for the movement i do recognize just because those few individuals of that african-american descent did something not all african-americans are like that same with us vice versa not all mexicans are like the mexicans trump says we are but la puraneta like it sucks having to watch those videos because they there's been a uh another elotero man and there's been a lady there's been a another guy another um older gentleman selling um i believe was mask oranges i don't know somewhere in the street but it just sucks because i know that not a lot of influencers are gonna bring awareness to this so i'm here with my 12 000 subscribers account bringing awareness to this because this  has to stop la puerta de planeta has to stop because how are we gonna unite if we keep and we keep fighting each other we have to fight together to make a change in this world to impact this world um just because you know our own damn president is racist honestly he's hella racist he doesn't like us he doesn't like us he doesn't like us minorities and it just sucks and then he watches those videos and then he's gonna be like oh there's a minority in minority crime okay but i just want to bring awareness to this guys and i don't know if you guys seen the videos but it's heartbreaking it really does suck um i believe he has a gofundme account um i'm not too sure which one specifically because i know jimmy and me the open one and i know a lady that worked with him actually opened one tamiya so um i don't know which one to donate to but i'm pretty sure one of those two is still gonna get to him he's still gonna go to him so um this upcoming friday when i get paid obviously i'm gonna you know send some money out hopefully it's still up i get paid till friday but i just wanted to talk a little bit about it just because it it it's devastating it sucks like i said we have to be together we have to be united as one so we could overcome all the bs they have against us minorities but at the end of the day guys like i said just because you guys see those individuals doesn't mean all african americans are like that obviously it's those people are hella bad they're they're pieces of yes i understand don't blame the rest of them just because of them and honestly i feel like these guys um if you guys don't know these guys were in long beach and guys i know some people are going to go after them but just be careful out there and do what's right in the world don't be stupid and yeah just i don't know that's all i got to say i guess", "jQ9MYMlP_Io": "with endless flavor possibilities homemade cbd gummy

Day and all the moms out there there was a bunch of recipes to pick from in our new cookbook and I thought let's really make it a treat let's make wine gummy bear yes I love my and so does Moe and Moe can finally have a little glass of wine now so we are really gonna celebrate and if you would like to make these non-alcoholic you can do that right moe yeah you can make them with orange juice or an apple cider or anything else but these are really fun because you can make them with white wine red wine or Rose a or whatever your favorite wine is my mom's side of the family is Italian and we just love lying we sip wine at dinner and she cooks with wine she's his wine when she's making like pasta sauces this is just a total ode to her it's a very yummy yummy treat so if your mom likes wine she may love this recipe I'm so excited this is the first time also that we're making gummy bears on the show homemade gummy bear and they're good yeah they're yummy okay Bo since you are the new mama mm-hmm which type of wine would you like to start off with we'll make that one we'll show how to do it and then I'll make more but which one do you want to start off with let's do rose egg all day oh we do a Rosie all day make these it's the same process with all of them whether it's rosy or a red or a white but we're gonna walk you through how to make the roses I'll make more as well and also before we get started when these are made like when they're all done they do contain a little bit of alcohol it doesn't bake out there's a little bit left over I think you have to eat like 50 of them for it to even be like half of glass of wine but I just thought I would throw that out there as a disclaimer that it doesn't bake out completely but you do have to eat a lot of them to feel an effect if that makes sense yeah okay so there was my disclaimer all right mo are you ready to get started I'm ready let's get started first step in front of us we have all of the ingredients and I'll be posting the ingredients and the instructions and the measurements in the description down below so if you'd like to make these yourself you can know take it away what's the first thing we do to make some gummy bear well the first no way I eat your hand sorry it's the Bears mouth here the first thing that you definitely need to make gummy bears is a gummy bear mold and this one is actually from the rope aching line yes that's ours and I love it because it has a little detail of the little bear faces and it has the little bear paws it's a little detail this is so cute we took so much time developing and designing this one but you can use any mold that you've got there's so many of them online but this is our favorite and it even comes with a little dropper that helps you get it in the mold so just like it's still everywhere which is something I would definitely do so this is wonderful I love gummy bears but I was like why don't they have cuter little faces so we put a little bit of detail but not too much and they're like just so adorable so I'll put a link down below to that mold as well know what's the first step the first step is to take some of your rose egg and mix it with the gelatin and then let it sit to bloom and blooming is just letting those materials come together combine and it kind of gets blooming is like if it gets yellow gets a little like grainy and it looks like jello weed takes about five minutes takes five minutes all right move show them how to do it we've got a little bit of the rose a we're starting with Rosie you don't drink it you mix it oh that's the tough part mo it kind of matches your shirt actually kind of yours too okay okay we do not plan this this is just a happy accident I'm all about it and then you mix together like this and you'll see it's already getting a little chunky and that's what you want but then you're gonna let it sit I don't even know the last time I was able to have Rosie come on it's like a year it's been over your mo has not had Rosie or any wine in over a year let's set this back to the side let that blue yeah we're gonna add this blue then what do we do next next step take your sugar corn syrup and a little bit more of Rosie and a sauce pot over to the stove we're gonna heat these up together for a couple minutes in the saucepan mix together the sugar corn syrup and 1/3 cup of wine and bring to a boil over medium heat once boiling reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes then remove from the heat and take it over to your baking station we just remove the mixture from the stove I'm placing it down here be careful because the pot is hot hot and while the mixture is still hot no what are you gonna do we're gonna add the bloomed of gelatin you can see it's kind of its kind of jelly it's kind of grainy looks like jello it really sticks together it's very firm yeah the gelatin absorbed all of the rose' which is what we wanted scoop it in there mo be careful mo just gonna keep mixing that together having that melt while Lou is doing that I'm gonna add our last ingredient citric acid then mix together till the bloom gelatin melts with everything else we're almost a wine go means oh that smells nice Molly doesn't that smell like a fancy little wine night it does like we could just watch some movies curl up on the couch and like eat little wine gummy beers yeah which is what we should do today we should we should do that once mixed it's time to strain our mixture this is gonna get rid of bumps and chunks before we make these adorable little gummy bears we want nice smooth delicious yeah gummies yeah we don't want chunky gummy you got smooth oh yeah in front of us we've got a medium-sized bowl and a little strainer do you want me to hold that yeah just be careful okay I'm gonna pour it in really slowly okay and then pour it through whoa nice and slow want to get everything I like this mixture cuz it really does stick together yeah scrape it in there we want to make as many dumi beers as we can no wine left behind no wine left behind oh look how pretty color this is okay okay let me see oh look at what we got here you got some clumps get out of here awesome clue we don't want that in New Guinea yeah get out of here okay now it is all strained and while it's still warm we're gonna put it into our gummy bear mold we can use these little guys they're like little droppers little teardrop bears they just you just fill it all the way up to the top yeah so mo tell us like what it's like to be a mom now I have so much respect for all moms out there I am so obsessed with Grayson like he is probably the best part of my day waking up like seeing a smile and cuddling with him and just seeing him name seeing him grow every day and learn new things it's it's the coolest thing he's so cute he's so cute how does mom life is it like like like tell me about it well you don't sleep you really don't okay it's been an adjustment but you just you get used to it learn how to function on a lot less sleep yeah that's right that's what you're doing and that's why you deserve a delicious Mother's Day treat that's right so this Mother's Day if you're not making her one of these do something nice for Mom she'll call your mom say thank you yeah cuz now mo knows how much work it is to raise a little baby and it's a lot of work okay baby Grayson is taking a nap right now but can we see him when he wakes up yes all right the tray is full mm-hmm and it is ready to chill we're gonna pop this in the refrigerator for two hours to set and then they are ready to serve also this recipe makes about five dozen gummy bears mm-hmm so depending on your tray size you might want to make a couple trays so she'd probably you press it in here I should really I'm gonna go put these in the refrigerator and then let's go see hi baby Grayson like okay baby hey there's my nephew hello he's getting so big lady-y-y he was a new boy he was like this big you know he's this vignette he's about seven pounds now he's 12 welcome to the kitchen baby gray this is where we do all the baking it's where your very first birthday cake will be made right here oh my god it's Liberty

baby nephew okay I'm totally ready okay man step to jepty grab and put him against ya what if he wants to day in he can dance like a human you using Itt are you so baby speaks losing your beep beep beep yeah hey butI in Japan these movie in the pants he like are there he's definitely our family handsome such a big boy oh my God he's such a big boy why are you the cutest man there we go there's the spark so baby needs a beat thank state booty in the paints that's your new hit single dance the booty in the pants yeah because you're here because you feel okay you're gonna go hang out with Uncle Mike now and we're gonna finish making some gummy bears yeah okay oh my gosh I think I'm back I'm back oh right mm-hmm the gummy bears have chilled and you know it's just time to pop them out mm-hmm in front of me I just have a piece of parchment paper but you can pop them onto a plate into a bowl whatever you'd like to know in your mouth all of them you have to wait they're kind of sticky so you flip it upside down and push them out just push them yeah fish your mouth Oh oh my gosh look at that how cute they are cute I love the details like look here musta come here they stand up like it up also oh if you ever make these and you skip the ingredient citric acid they just won't taste like a gummy it's hard for me to explain but when I was playing around and developing this recipe I need it without that ingredient and it just wasn't right it had the sweetness but it just have that Oh lemony likes it like citrus that that all the gummy candies have so I went to like our favorite candy place sugarfina and they have like champagne gummy bears and all this and on the back it had all the ingredients and I tried adding the different ones and you know what it was citric acid you are just a little bit of that and it just changes the game so if you're ever making gummies and they don't quite taste right and you're not using that ingredient that could be it that's the ticket as soon as I test baked and I added that ingredient and took a bite I went what what what that's a gummy bear they're going up and not just for wine gummy bears but any gummy bear if you're making like a juice flavor or you're making a sour gummy literally anything that ingredient is so important cheers to us I got a taste test okay yeah happy Mother's Day mo mmm I love this it's light it's meat and it's got that mm-hmm that little Turk after flavor and you can still yummy used even though it's such such such a small amount of Rosie that's actually in it you know him you still get the flavors of it which is delicious most favorite all right mo let's pop the rest of these out and then that let's make some other flavor yeah we have like red wine white wine and a rose a we can make some extra for Mamma Mia our Mamma Mia oh she loved it yes she would let me oh right cue the montage [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] tada here are the homemade wine gummy bears that we made today we have our rose a blue are red and our white yep and remember if you ever want to make these non spirited you can just replace the wine ingredient with any fruit juice like you could make these with grape juice yeah like a dark grape juice or a white grape juice you can do whatever you'd like you just evenly replace the ingredient again I'll be putting the recipe down below and we'll be taking lots of pictures and posting these all over social medias if you make these gummy bears please take a picture and send it to us oh my god we loves you your baking creations it like makes us so happy it makes

it's not really like a bear bear he's a panda bear that you know looks quite delicious because the Q's I'm also gonna show you a bunch of experiments hacks and DIY so you can do with gummy bear let's get started and go shopping safely we have social distancing let's get [Music] [Applause] like 19 of these we cleared out the store he need a hundred so we're gonna go to the next door there's two

thousand four hundred gummies are you gonna do that no I already ate it you ain't 400 oh no no no maybe like 200 300 small packs are pretty easy to open I could just open them up and tip out the gummy bears these multi-path have to open the big path and each of the individual packs so here is our Neutral 1000 gummies now it's time to unwrap these Oh easy than I thought alright guys I think we're 1/3 of the way through I'm trying not to eat these gummy bears you just ate - I wonder if cats like gummy bears really you don't like them it is not to my liking I prefer lasers yuck where is my fisherman never tried a gummy bear below you have your own YouTube channel yes I do subscribe or I will do few lucky cooker you wanna try coming there anything is this friend no it's weird uh-huh you prefer the camera Oh No okay I'm out ah he's out too Haley's cats don't let go me oh you know what I need coffee okay finally [Applause] I just realized I have a gummy bear planned decoration because I just green light give me a thumbs up guys thank me for my efforts [Music] alright guys we did it a mountain of 10,000 gummi bears if I lean back it looks huge [Music] now we're gonna figure out how to melt all of these so first up we're gonna try microwaving your pup a few yellow gummies into the dog whoa the bubbly it dried up and solidified straightaway anything this is liquid enough for me to do anything with microwave didn't work out so well you know what there's like a super cool live hack that you can do in the oven let's test it out [Music] I'm gonna show you guys how to make some gummy bear lollipops all you need for this hack is gummy bears lollipop sticks and baking paper let's make some lollipops I'm going to be using the four gummy bears per lollipop then I'm just gonna pop them in the oven and wait for them to know when they're melted just please see a lollipop sticks onto the gummies we have the lollipops what I actually did was put them in the fridge make them solid and they look really good now you have a gummy lollipop it's shochu mmm it's tough this next half is so cool you can make super cute gummy bear charms using hot glue if you can't find a gummy bear mold you can make your own using some liquid silicon I just got these glitter hot glue sticks I can't wait to test them out the glue stick please your hot glue into the mold are set I put them in the fridge to speed up the process so let's pop them out to the cutest can decorate you can make jewelry out of it you can decorate your books with it you can stick them anywhere so adorable so you don't have to mix 10,000 bits to see a giant gummy bear i'm gonna show you what hack we can take this little bit right here and make him grow up fast you need a cut and then you want to fill it let's take a gummy and drop it after about 24 hours of the gummy grows in size as it takes in the water pretty cool trick right it is time to make my Ellie bear mole imagine eating a gummy bear as videos of this we there there and there that making a mold out of a soft toy is a little bit awkward but I'm gonna make it work so usually I'd use a two-pot silicon mixture but we would need so much of that mixture because he is so big kind of expensive so instead I bought a whole bunch of liquid silicon sealant from the hardware store [Music] oh that actually work be there there we're gonna make a replica of you oh why you so heavy panda bear it's my hormones can you believe that I hold you of this was only two dollars a tea technically I've tested this before are now mini-mall did earlier with the hot glue but I haven't done it on something so big so I'm hoping at home so my panda bear is ready he is definitely not happy we're gonna prepare a bowl of warm water and turn it can actually dip our hands in it and mold the silicon as soon as it hits the bear you smooth it on and make sure it takes its shape we don't have the detergent on our hands is gonna stick to our hand depending on the brand you buy this stop can smell really bad prepared myself a face mask oh it's like a snake oh that's Christ out of fungi [Music] oh it feels like clay this action is pretty good it feels very satisfying I'm just molding the silicon around mr. panda bear it's actually quite easy to be honest and you're starting to feel like it's a bit more tacky onto your hand you've run out of detergent so you should read it [Music] and a bear is fully encased in silicon it was actually easier than I thought now we wait for you to say Amy I stuck the gummy bear 100 go looks like the gummy bear two three four five seven eight oh boo my side becomes yeah oh no no - - all right guys it's been 24 hours panda has been chilling in his silicon mold ooh it feels dry it's so fancy he see that I'm really impressive this silicon hat doesn't smell too bad like from here but if you really get close he smells like your vinegar on my nose oh you see that he's coming right off that is so cool I mean and it hasn't really damaged his fur at all like peeling Elmer's glue off your hand oh yeah actually much easier that he's actually a soft boy cuz like what I'm doing is I'm pushing down and he's peeling off the silicon I finally got the mold up oh my gosh that is kind of really satisfying use unharmed I can see the face on the other side that's crazy all right let's put him down ooh that's not good we have a problem panda let himself go in a 10,000 coming bear panda bear is not holding himself up and we're gonna have to pour the gummy in while he's facing down what we need is like a little bit of support to hold his arms up let me go right and then back in the mold so that you can keep its shape while we fill Oh guys we are rescuing Panda oh all that with vinegar was so struck the mold looks really good I was time to melt outcomes alright guys so this is my yummy rainbow Roy CG this rainbow is getting worse every we are so many different shades of orange and yellow oh there's some Reds making its way in there my bad [Music] time phalanges random facts they didn't need to know but I'm gonna tell you anyways because I wanna tell me best were invented in 1922 by German candy maker Hans Reigle I hope I pronounced that correctly Oh sadly the green gummy bears are actually strawberry flavors and sir confused I guess I got a taste at home apparently the clear ones a pineapple flavor II oh okay the flavor is so subtle and speaking of giant gummy bears that we're gonna make today the biggest one money can buy is actually 36 pounds the one we're gonna make today is actually going to be 44 pounds looking at random facts and weird things if you guys want to see more of this don't forget to subscribe to react accordance with me and max actually look at a lot of these things it's time to get melting alright let's go [Music] this is the last year's save his ears so now it's time to wait for mr. yummy panda bear to set so it's been a full day halfway through I was checking up on the gummy and seeing if it was setting or some reason it wasn't sitting properly it was still really gooey put it in the fridge buzz off fridge isn't that big to kind of take him out of the ride and a squash him up it should be set by now oh no you know what he is perfectly solid but he is very out of shape oh you they're heavy oh my god oh I mean he was so cute before the guy was still really sticky I don't think Ari melted gummy sets really well now we know it's better to meet gummy from scratch his ear came out so well this is so heavy you left out for the week got on a diet and flat on his stomach bit me he ain't good abs it's kind of a bear shape let's peel him oh my god he's still kind of have a face [Music] he's actually very yes [Music] oh my gosh guys I can't believe we did it we melted 10,000 gummy bears into one giant gummy bear we made out of mold we melted it all he came through I actually didn't know if this was possible when I started the video he is adorable slightly deformed but that's okay we love a unique bear and I wanted to make like a nice different rainbow color thing but it just kinda looks Brown this is a normal gummy bear and this is my giant 10,000 gummy bear bear how's it look guys it is time to eat my goat hey Matt yeah how long do you think he'll take you to eat is gummy bear I think you and making a bed for what oh if you can eat it in two

I'll see you in my next bye guys love you MA", "aEJR15oR3mM": "today I do not really be trying some a sour and fruity gummy candies Mary who lives in Washington state a syntheses they apparently have a Japanese dollar store which I've never even heard of which I think it's the coolest thing in the world so she bought the use of the Japanese dollars for these are the Purell I don't have to be right and I have grant we haven't written a different place oh no you just looked in the wrong punch these are made with real fruit juice it says there are all right product of Japan a big picture of a green apple espresso I could just like yes the company looks like it's Cabaye and kab aya this is a tie a vitamin city kebaya Foods Corporation in Okinawa okay okay something over you know yeah that's it one serving per container is the whole body $60 yeah wishes pushing and this is a resealable oh wow that smells strong I think that's like an alcohol Wow okay so I'm gonna show you how many you get because you can have this whole package 460 calories one two three four five six seven eight nine ten twelve there's 12 pieces this is strong I am here to do that I love right yeah the reaction about that man the tartness is what smack right first like wow that's sour but then you're left with a nice bright flavor after you get over that yes that's that once you get your breath back after this are the thorn it's extremely tar they're calling it sour but I think more I think tart is a good more for that tough hard like outside to like it is like some alcoholic drinks it's like those wine cheese very very heart no one sees the wine yummy yeah one guys they were low in one yeah I remember one goes from Canada that we got do these no these were actually wide but I actually think this would be good if you could put it in your mouth and just suck on it and and have it like for a mint or something oh I like grape though I don't that make a very good man and this isn't like a grape I've had before though it's just it's very very strong very strong hey this is a green apple $150 that oh [Applause] okay you may need happy years again I'm sure you get 12 of them those are actually sweeter I like that one better hmm that was a sweeter it's because it doesn't have so it doesn't have the power inside the talked or its sourness is it's very very minimal I so it doesn't bother you it thanks for watching I would I wouldn't actually mind even the great though if you I think what you guys used to think have you got used to it I don't think it would bother you at all honey you don't wanna know I think if you eat these all the time and then it's not gonna bother you how much you made enough of those break ones your tongue with her Krong cuz it's got so much harvester probably but it says chewy outside jelly inside and that's exactly what it is out of the to a right like the green apples better but I still think you can get used to the gripe and I still think it's a good you know candy so thank you Mary very much for thinking of us when you went in the Japanese dollar store I really appreciate it I hope everyone enjoyed getting to see these and thanks for watching [Music]", "RcVOWaIsDes": "today I'm gonna be doing something really fun for children and this is my version of jell-o gummy bears so let me set up with all the ingredients that we need and I'll be back in a second so now that I've set up I'm gonna show you exactly what we need I have a silicon gummy bear mold a measuring cup for our water we're gonna be starting off with cold water but I'm gonna get to that step in just a second you're gonna need one tablespoon of gelatin that is equal to 15 milliliters and if you buy your gelatin in little pockets this is what it looks like it's a standard package and this holds one tablespoon or 15 milliliters and also a regular sized box of jell-o and this here is 85 grams so for our first step I'm gonna get my water ready and I'm gonna come back in one second for my first step I have added 1/2 a cup of cold water from my kitchen sink that is very important you need the water to be cold I am now gonna take that 1 tablespoon of gelatin and I'm just gonna sprinkle it over the top of the cold water and I'm gonna let this sit here for about 5 minutes because I want this to completely dissolve in that cold water you can already see that it's dissolving quite quickly so I'm just gonna let that go for a few more minutes and then I'll come back so this is 5 minutes later and I've just taken a fork and just stir this around everything is nicely dissolved and now I'm gonna take my last little bit of water 1/4 cup and dump that right in so in here we have a total of 3 quarters of a cup of water I am now gonna take this put this into the microwave and just microwave it for about a minute until it's hot so that was 1 minute on high and you can see now that it's much clearer that's because heat has been introduced into the gelatin and water and now we are ready to add in our actual jello mixture so I've opened up our little box of jell-o and now I'm gonna get that right in there and because the liquid is hot all of the jello mixture is gonna really just dissolve that much easier in there well I smells good too and I am using a cherry today I'm just gonna mix this around so you don't have to worry about the exact temperature that you heat this to in your microwave just make sure that it's hot does not have to be boiling just hot and that will help all the you know the actual package contents mix up in there really well and that's good and now we are ready to fill our mold so I've just put my mold on a little cutting board because this is very very flexible and if it's very hard to lift up when it's full so we're ready to pour it just give that a little bit of a stir just to make sure that all the contents are completely mixed but nothing has settled to the bottom and then I'm gonna start filling our little mold and that looks good just like that okay I'm just cleaning this up and now we are ready to pop this into the fridge so you want to put this in the fridge not the freezer just into your fridge and just let this chill down for about four hours and you're gonna have a really really nice gummy bears so I'm gonna pop this into my fridge and I'll come back much later on and I'm gonna show you the final product and they are really fun and they are full of flavor a few hours later once your jello has completely set you can just peel out your little gummy bears that's what's so nice about the silicone is that you can get right in there and just peel them right out so I'll continue doing this so I'll be back in a second and our last one and there we have them let's get them around the right way look at that really nice let me zoom in so I've zoomed in just a little bit to show you how nice these are and there we have it our jello gummy bears and look at how really gummy these are really really nice you can see that extra gelatin will really set these up really well and these here are super super fresh hmm a burst of flavor right in your mouth super super fresh hmm YUM I just zoomed in a little bit more because I think I heard some of you say zoom in a little bit more I want to see a little bit more detail in those gummy bears and here we have them aren't those cute made with jell-o and gelatin a little bit of water there we have them really fun really really delicious that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I really do appreciate that and that's it for today I'll see you next time you", "WPakqUMCCIA": "So today I'm making gummy candy. I'm starting with a half cup of cold water,\nand to that I'm going to add three packets of plain gelatin. I'm just going to open these up, you can find\nthese in the store, they're available in the little box. I'm using Knocks but any kind will do, and\nI just want to add this gradually so it won't clump up. So just with a nice spatula or spoon make\nsure that your constantly stirring. Stir, stir, stir. You can see it's turning into a gelatin kind\nof a mess here. Which is perfect, just what we're looking\nfor. So I'm just going to stir that around and\nlast but not least I'm going to add one whole packet of Jello, because I'm really just going\nfor it. And I'm using the blue one, but any flavor\nyou like will do. Just pour it in there and again stir it around\nso nothing will clump up. So that is it, I'm going to take my candy\nand I'm going to move it to I have a pot of water simmering on this stove. And then I'm just going to heat it up inside\nthis pot of water. So I'm using a glass measurement cup and I'm\njust letting the heat from the water, kind of heat up my mixture. So this way none of my gelatin is going to\nend up burning, it's all very safe, very kind of a gentle process. You could also just pop it right into the\nmicrowave if you prefer and that's fine too. I'm just going to let that kind of simmer,\nand get nice and thick. So my mixture has melted so I'm ready to go,\nand here I have a nice cute little I have like a jewel mold. You can get any kind of plastic mold that\nyou like or any other kind of candy mold that. The little bears are really fun and adorable. But just while my gelatin is still nice and\nsmooth and liquid, I'm just going to go ahead and pour it right into my mold. You can even go ahead and fill it the way\nup to the top or as big as you like them. That is it. I'm going to let those sit up on the counter\nfor about 10 to 15 minutes or until they're nice and firm to the touch, to keeping them\nto the heat of your house you might need a little longer or a little less. But as soon as they're firm I'm going to take\nthem out of the mold and we're ready to go. So my blue gummy candy are still setting up\nbut I have some that are already done, so these are just the same just with a lemon\nflavor and a cherry flavor. The same recipe and you could see them getting\nnice and firm and chewy. Now if you want to get that kind of classic\nsour candy coating, you take a little bit of sugar mixed with a touch of citric acid. And what that's going to do is give our candies\na nice sour coating. And that's it or you can leave them plain\nor you can just drench them in sugar. Anything that you like, but anyway, enjoy. That's how you make gummy candies at home.", "EI2FrKdifbk": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got a fresh look at that ooh that is pretty to look at a fresh jar of Nutella and pancakes love Nutella if you didn't know a fresh jar to tell us and that means we are gonna be reviewing some gummies that's right guys we're back with more gummies I always know I'm telling you to be wary of gummies I'm weary of gummies and I'm wary of these gummies so this was a 500 milligrams worth of gummies don't worry I'm not eating all 500 milligrams today we're just gonna do a test to see if there any potent whatsoever I picked these up for 30 bucks at my dispensary so a very good deal if these are in fact 500 milligrams worth of gummies I doubt that that is gonna be the case this is the canna MX brand taste innovation only the finest quality there are 50 gummy bears in here in total with 10 milligrams per gummy bear so we are going to do 20 in total for 200 milligrams and we're gonna do our review on 200 milligrams of the canon mix in total canna MX canna mix I'm gonna go with canna mix is how you say that it's spelled canna MX all one word unless so again 30 bucks for 500 milligram gummy edible is a great deal if in fact it works but there are a lot of red flags chiefly the price you get what you pay for when it comes to edibles second the packaging this isn't cheap easy to make packaging it's just a sticker on a ziplock bag always a bad sign to we're almost always a bad sign I've had a couple of good things come in cheap packaging like this but not a lot um and just the fact they're gummies that's also usually a bad sign I have bad luck with gummies there are a lot of people unscrupulous folks out there making gummies that aren't worth they're a damn and I'm hoping that isn't gonna be the kids that can of MX we're gonna give him a totally fair shot so I have Nutella just to uh turley completely boost my of getting any kind of tolerance she's taking a little bit of extra fat with the gummies just to help process that THC so here we go let's open them up give the taste test the smell test all that fun stuff so you can see the gummies in there they look like pretty plain gummies they don't have any coating on them they don't have anything additional on them it smells both intensely fruity and intensely cannabis ewwww so here we go nothing on the outside they're not sticky or anything like that I'm just gonna grossly dip it right in Nutella get some fat going here there we go mm hmm well I didn't really taste any cannabis but that might be because I've got the Nutella on it but Wow okay a little bit of cannabis taste on that one okay let's just try one clean here there's a slight cannabis taste to them but really these are on the less cannabis II and of gummy taste that I for gummies or less cannabis II tasting gummies that I've had also a bad sign this is not gross tasting like the etta pure infused creations which I find really hard to stomach although I don't find those to be any good whatsoever so I'm hoping that doesn't mean that these are gonna be bad but we'll have to find out so I've eaten four already I'm gonna do sixteen more and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review you don't really care about how these can be Bears tastes you want to know if Kanna MX is something you should be buying in the future so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know for sure thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been two hours since I had the canna mx-5s quality 500 milligram gummies I only had 200 milligrams of them but there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there i am i high at all i'm like a - maybe somewhere in there don't feel pleasantly stoned I feel like I had to join an hour ago yeah [ __ ] Ken MX and their gummy bears it's a load of [ __ ] these aren't potent at all another crappy gummy and another crappy gummy company all the telltale signs were there that she priced the sticker the she packaging oh and all kin of MX no do not spend your money on these guys if you see them stay far far away I do have some of their chocolate bars to review maybe they'll be good I have seen where chocolate bars are still good and the gummy brands are bad where when people have both like um we get a flavor ex their chocolate isn't bad but their gummies are terrible so we'll see but as right now just pass on the gummy bears don't waste your money and [ __ ] these guys for you know where's the lab tested result where's the nutrition information where's all that good stuff it's not here because they don't want you to know because it's just gummy bears they bought off the shelf and infused maybe some cannabis in there possibly who knows maybe I'm just high because I smoked like two hours ago and that's what I'm still feeling not feeling anything most boy I this is like our sixth dud review in a row or something maybe we've had a string up they might not all come out in the order of duds in a row but I have reviewed a bunch of doodoo back to back to back I am really looking for a diamond in the rough a pleasant surprise I was hoping Kevin MX was it gonna be it I gave him a fair shot but definitely do not gonna be the gummy bears from them so final conclusion if you see Kanna mx4 now avoid everything I'll review their chocolate if their chocolates good I'll be sure to let you know we'll assess them fairly but for right now there's no reason to buy any of their products because if they're gonna rip you off with this it's more than likely they're gonna rip you off with other things so sorry to be a bummer guys I really wish we could have had something more fun for you but at least we know not to mix it up with Kanna MX or something so guys thank you so much for watching this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see on the next review peace", "1CbfG0epWHo": "cookies worlds chocolate-chip cookies this time has come to make this jumbo jumbo 6-inch gummi bear okay so here is the moles for the

I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy

saying what's up um but uh if you couldn't tell from the title it is another delta 8 thc video this time we have some gummies and i also have a cartridge so we're going to be using both in here and he's never tried delta 8 before so if you don't know what delta 8 is what we usually smoke is delta 9 thc so this is a new thing that they have it's delta 8 which is another cannabinoid that people have been you know it's been picking up a lot of steam now you know kind of like when cbd came out you know people are just like well you can get this legally anywhere in the united states it's just like cbd but i won't provide any links anywhere like on the uh description because i've been deleted over cbd before so just trying to be careful but it is 300 milligrams of gummies uh our thc eight in this in these gummies and we're gonna go half on it and we're gonna see how it hits and then we're gonna be hidden on some of this gorilla glue hybrid which is ninety percent delta eight thc with 10 terps i do like to mention is that i did try the other disposable one and delta 8 does not taste like delta 9 in any way it tastes a little bit different um but mostly i just tasted the terpenes but there is a bitterness towards the end like toward like a medicine taste but you know that delta a delta yeah it just came out didn't just come out but it's been around but people haven't really been talking about it as it is now can you um just hold these for a thumbnail or something oh over here so i could i don't have to see your knee all right now open the gummies so like i said ladies and gentlemen oh yeah they even have nutritional facts on this [ __ ] i'm like damn brother you know qr code as well and you know no no you know yeah so open it and that's uh let's see what pour some in your hand actually for uh for like a thumbnail and just a few and then put the the thing so i could read the the thing you know all right yeah okay got it yeah all right so back on this camera we are gonna eat uh so there's 10 gummies each i think um so you already have two in your hand no don't drop the sugar what is this [ __ ] thc eight okay so he has five they actually have uh nine in here uh i would say maybe yeah because i i've already tried this my tolerance is a bit higher so you still have 1200 i mean you want to split on this one no that's knocking this is perfect okay all right i need to be able to function later still you guys well we don't uh so i've been told that thc 8 or delta 8 thc is a bit more mild not as intense and psychoactive as cannabis but then again we're eating it and eating thc is different than smoking or vaping so different feeling so yeah cheers it's got some chew on it that's not saying not bad this is good candy okay candy wise that's pretty far there's a car just like hello you know what i did i did think that maybe they would have had more flavors just because the the packaging was all rainbow two players or so yeah these two i wonder if there's thc in the circle sugar crystals oh it smells like a berry yeah whoa i think i ate one you just look all the salt or so what we're going to do guys because i know our tolerance or edibles don't seem to hit till like 20 20 minutes or so later not not too long i mean it doesn't hit too quick we're going to be hitting on this and then we're going to stop the video and then we're going to um i guess turn that back the camera on and tell us or tell you how we feel you know i'm saying if we do even feel anything resume the video as soon as this is done but yeah it came with the same package this came with the same uh oh yeah same person oh okay all right open up handcrafted boys [Music] there is a bit like a slight bit minimal bitterness towards the end with that candy but un barely noticeable i didn't really notice it too much that's why i said barely he said too much and barely noticed it too much see all right maybe you do i guess i'm just kidding all right um yeah we're ripping this way go ahead we're going in wow oh by the way we're outside randy's house so don't trip we're just oh [ __ ] very thin pinkish heel looking oil this would look like if it's vape oil yeah i see maple like this all right so uh i did mention in my first delta eight video that interesting uh i did mention that when i first heard of pink oil i was like what the [ __ ] but you know apparently it's uh delta eight when it's uh it shows or it's delta a that makes it pink or sometimes so i don't know i'm not a scientist in any way so they're not are they all different you think pretty sure right what do you mean like as far as the color i don't know i think they're the same throughout the day so we're going to be using the shiv you guys know the shiv right off the bat i this is it seems like a pretty nice cartridge itself probably going to lower it to let's do a 2.6 and as usual we're gonna let now he said in case it's poison i'll do it first i guess that's right so that way i get poison next that makes total sense you should let me go down see that i get poison and then you'll be like oh okay i'm not going to hit it now all right or it doesn't even hit oh yeah delta eight sorry buddy you want to try again check atomizer damn thing's pretty smart it tells you like what possibly could be wrong with it yeah that's pretty cool all right so apparently this is not compatible with this um i don't have another battery in here but i'll probably do an individual video on this but we still did take the thc so uh we're going to wait and see what's going on um do you have a battery i think i do unless you can get do you have a battery in here let me go check that's all i was thinking or now i think i do have one it just might not be good [ __ ] it it's probably better one that doesn't work right that's true i'll be right back throw this away we'll be back see he's we're really outside his house put this inside i'm feeling the delta oh the friendly farm that don't work yeah i think yeah i think it's that one that's gonna work all right let's see you guys it's just auto hit oh it's dead [ __ ] i have a charge in my car maybe we can [Applause] oh you got in the mail yeah my brother orders it i think you can't hit it like that i think i tried it before hey what's up oh [ __ ] that was your brother oh no it's all good so it has like a weird blinker time you have to like keep hitting it until like it actually turns on let me see try it it's probably because it's like oh yeah it's still blinking red still because it's gonna look kind of dead actually we're gonna get some time to charge guys yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right boys we back um he ended up being able to sneak a hit off this so let's just get another hit off of it um it's probably been about 10-15 minutes since we did take the the thc eight gummies so uh give it a few more minutes and we'll see but i planned on you know hitting this cartridge and uh hopefully boosting uh the [ __ ] feeling of the thca heat but yeah [Music] and so this is gorilla glue thc uh okay so it doesn't taste like medicine though don't taste bad you'll feel it and when you feel it just don't stop hitting it until it blinks but uh the similar bitterness towards the end but not bad like not much pretty much like a sprite like a lemon when you're trying it honestly it tastes like [ __ ] those medicine gummies that you eat the vitamin the vitamin ones yeah it tastes like that the flintstones don't taste bad yeah you know they're they're bearable at the end of the day this is people consider you know you know uh marijuana medicine you know what i'm saying so what's to say if it tastes like medicine a little bit you know it might be more willing to try it maybe the taste of delta 8 thc is that medicine taste because i've never tasted this coming from a distillate and you're gonna be like like thc nice little taste of like lemony yeah yeah like uh like a sprite like a sprite yeah that's a good one very similar to the other jack carrera one i do like to mention that uh gorilla glue is a sativa hybrid and jeff herrera is also a sativa so that's probably why they have similar terpenes or at least like a piney lemony you know so does this hit the same like amount of thc as the other one or delta nine or something i don't even know there's different deltas you could have like delta one through nine and [ __ ] now so uh i've heard from people i don't know if this is true or not i've read it i've seen people tell me that you know uh people use delta eight to lower their tolerance on delta nine because the tolerance of delta eight does not uh is not the tolerance with delta nine but i've heard that it isn't i've heard that uh delta eight is more of a like a more mild high it's not really too much as thc you know thc or delta nine thc [ __ ] getting confused but yeah um i'm a little confused on that too but i can see like so delta a is just basically it's a new cannabinoid that's not new but it's barely getting studied right now and it's barely picking up steam just like cbd did like two years ago um people are like a lot of uh street carts or fake cartridges that are uh probably pink or this pinkish hue it's probably delta eight you know since it's legal you can buy it and then probably street dealers are probably putting it in their cartridges i don't know um but me using this one is not bad you know i believe it's 25 for a gram out the door and for people that are in illegal states that don't have access to you know uh legal cannabis products you know this is a better uh not better alternative this is an alternative wait so they uh you can buy this legally and like in the clubs right now oh i have actually seen delta a products in authentic oh sure okay yeah but you can buy this online on websites there's a lot of companies three chai shout out to naruto i believe there's another one i forgot another one he mentioned but you know uh i'm in a place where i'm fortunate enough to have companies uh message me i don't really message too many companies anymore but uh when they do message me and then they uh i check out their website and it's cool seems legit you know i will consider it you know what i'm saying yeah it doesn't taste bad at all it doesn't it's funny it does taste like sprite hey [ __ ] a lot of people like sprite you know what i'm saying dude sprite's like one of the only few sodas that i want yeah because it doesn't dye your teeth sprites [ __ ] the [ __ ] sprite so after taking a few hits off this and the gummies do you feel some some type of i feel that change i feel mellow yeah i was honestly gonna say that too like i'm not like like i'm not stupid faded you know like you would get from dabs and stuff and like real delta and 98c but i feel like just like in the first video i felt something it was definitely different than a normal high yeah like i don't feel like um i feel relaxed i feel relaxed mellowed out i don't feel like let's say if i was to like smoke a dab i'd take too much of a big dab sometimes i get paranoid i don't feel like i'm gonna get paranoid or not my mind and everything is like i'm relaxed i feel it this is refreshing because it is like a sprite you know what i'm saying and uh like off that first do a blinker do a finger and see what's up but lightweight low key i kind of feel like the edibles are starting to hit but then again it could just be you know i'm feeling this but i'm feeling because when you obviously like i mentioned earlier when you eat something it's much different than smoking or when you're eating cannabis it's much different than smoking it we're vaping it but i definitely feel it in my eyes oh yeah look at you see my new merch got the the wax right here oh [ __ ] evolution you took that photo yeah no i got it off a website that's royalty free picks so you know what i'm saying once you put it on there anyone could use it unsplash.com i think it's dead again i think we got enough hits out of it i would say uh but like i said man i am definitely feeling something different than a normal high that you would get off delta nine thc ugh oh i did just eat habit and maybe you know smoking after you're eating you don't feel it i don't [ __ ] know i'm trying to [ __ ] say something uh how are you feeling and i definitely feel high though no joke just just not like a normal high it's not a weird battery yeah it's not the best battery but it happens we made it happen yeah my eyes it matters so you know your opinion i give it i'll give it a go give it a good grade you know like i would i don't know like if i didn't i mean i didn't know about it now that i know about it and i see it around oh yeah yeah i might be like more interested on this channel too no i will say that now that i know about it from like you exposing it to me i might like if i go to the street i mean to the clubs and see it i might be more interested in buying it now because now i had an experience with it and i know it was good so i might be more interested and when i see it in the store to go and pick it up so i do say it was good yeah i like it are you would you say you're pretty i would say i'm pretty highly look at me you gotta talk and prove it oh yeah no for reals i usually usually stump i usually be stuttering looking [ __ ] like a number you're hitting pretty good and i'm proud of that y'all know me i'll be stuttering yeah so uh like i said uh earlier there's a lot of delta eight thc like companies out there so please just do your research uh this one's pretty good and i i would vouch for some other ones based on naruto's opinion because he's tried them uh but yeah just do your research and you know uh they this website that they have actually tells you like you know delta thc uh delta athc 101 has blogs articles on there so if you want to check that out and learn more on this website specifically i believe uh i'll post it in the comments post go and check it out yeah but uh let us know what you think in the comment section oh yeah and by the way subscribe to the homie you know i'm saying kind of ended with that but hopefully you did enjoy the video you got anything else to say to the lovely people of the internet i just want to say i hope you guys enjoy the video as well and we'll see you guys on the next one man hey peace out [Music] oh", "s1271Tn7Blc": "[Music] that's right you see what's up the booze is out and there's some candy here so what's the EJ gonna do he's gonna make some drunken ass gummy bears today that's right you know if I'm making some candy or a tree for a party you know what's got boobs involved in it that's right that's how we roll around here at DJ's brew to making the alcoholic fun well yeah anyways so we're gonna make some drunken gummy bears today or also I guess you could call them vodka infused gummy bears how are we gonna do this well we're gonna buy some gummy bears first here we've got a bag of gummy bears we've opened what type of gummy bears do you want to get you can't want to get ones that are clear there's some that are out there that aren't clear now they have less gelatin in them so they stay hard also I found that the harrybo brand of gummy bears are too hard also they are really dense and dry and it takes them a long time to diffuse like probably five days plus if you buy the ones that are super soft gummy bears they call them nowadays they won't hold up to the vodkas so just by everyday plain old dollar store type gummy bears not harrybo brand get ones you like to taste up because that's what it's gonna taste like when you're slamming it down anyways real easy we got like I said our gummy bears are gonna 5 ounce bag here and we've got a bottle of vodka mm-hmm and we have two mason jars what are we gonna do we're gonna put the bears into the mason jars top them off with vodka close it and let them sit for two days so we've got a real you know complex process here we've got our bag and our jar these have been sanitized already I like mason jars why well if you put them in a bowl what you can do the problem with that is you can't shake them okay or if you can't shake them it gets all over the place it or if you have to stir them sometimes it disturbs and breaks the gummy bears okay so here we have our two mason jars nice and sanitized and ready to go okay we've got our vodka we want to cover them with vodka inside the jar get them all happy this how we're going to get drunken gummy bears I've swirled them here we go let him go for a little bit of a swim I'm gonna go over the top oh I have to get some more vodka soon what a shame I have to go to the liquor store and shop for booze I hate that anyway so we have our jars here and each one has about an equal amount there over the top with vodka we're about a cup of vodka I think there's a little few more gummy bears in this one but anyways we've used about a cup total of vodka here real easy you can use any vodka you know what abused really cheap vodka sometimes you can taste that but you know what for the people who are gonna be drinking this and how you drink it it's not really for the taste is to get krump snell isn't it so we're gonna shake it let's be honest right give them a good shake boom and we're gonna let these sit for two days I'll be back after these guys get happy and they're getting their drink on now back in a flash hey guys forgot to mention one thing I know I didn't forget it because of all the drinking I do it's it's it's because I was so excited about this process anyways remember when yours letting me set for your two days you want to keep them in the refrigerator that'll help keep the gelatin together or while they're absorbing all this fun booze and you want to give them a little bit of shake now and again over the two day period so I'll see you in two days we'll be back and we're going to be having some fun with some big-ass gummies that are all full of smelly [Music] two days pass and as you can see here our gummies have drunk enough all that lovely vodka so now we have drunken gummies or fun alcoholic gummies that's right they've consumed all the vodka they've over doubled in size in the two days this particular brand seems to be doing really well in this real absorbent my tasted one of them and they're a little bit boozy so you say DJ what do you do if they're a little bit boozy and it all depends different gummies will taste sweeter than others because you know every mix and everything is a little bit different so I'm gonna reserve this one jar that has the last gummies in it and I think that some people will maybe like to taste that vodka and alcohol a little bit and some people won't so what do we do to counteract that we get some kool-aid concentrate here it's these little squirt bottles you can support this into your sports bottle make a quick bottle of sugar-free kool-aid or you can use it which it's real purpose is probably to put it into our gummies and we're gonna give them a little bit of kool-aid flavor and I'm gonna taste one of these here just in case for scientific purposes only and also to show you how much bigger that gummy is now he's really growing in size you can let me see I guess you can see them on the camera here I don't want to tip off but this is a green one let's see how it tastes hmm I still got that lime flavor when you chew it and eat it it has a consistency of jell-o now so I know these are just right it's got that vodka edge to it I know some of the ladies at the party aren't gonna like that vodka edge that's really who's gonna be eating these ladies and some of guys I want to get there quick crunk on so I'm gonna shake this up and this stuff's pretty powerful so you don't need a lot of it we're gonna put one two three four squirts in there that's it now alternately if you don't have this you can use concentrate for making like like fruit punch you know frozen concentrates it's just all it's basically the same kind of thing but this is a lot easier and we're gonna shake these up or but our gummies are bleeding now you can see all that alcohol and lovely booze and the sugar that's rendered out the gummies is sticking to the inside there so we're gonna let this get happy for another day I'll be back in another day it'll seem like a second for you but we'll have these four side-by-side comparison and we'll show you what they look like after they've absorbed some of this kool-aid concentrate and I'll tell you have to taste it hey guys I'm back you can see we got our two jars of gummies here one with concentrate for 24 hours and one without that have been still sitting happy in their liquid of happiness aka vodka and as you can see in the jars there's not too much liquid left but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna strain them out in with this little wire strainer here into our measuring cup and we'll show you how much rendered liquid is left leftover and I'll be back [Music] okay we're all done straining there are dummies out and look at what we've got here we've got two full bowls of our dummies we've got our ones that are flavored with the cherry kool-aid concentrate here on the on my right and we've got one without on the left now there looks like there's more in this bowl because there's more total gummies but they're all about the same size Dave mmm well more than doubled in size close to tripled and I think these ones here on the right with the concentrate maybe a little bigger because I have more vodka in the in the jar with those but if you take a look here on my measuring cup I've got a full math probably bout a quarter cup left now it's probably not all volume that's been generated by vodka because there's a little probably like gelatin like I don't know runoff from the gummies in there but that means these have absorbed probably a cup and a quarter of vodka into these guys so we've nearly tripled their size we've put all that lovely vodka in there and we flavor this and you say DJ what are those flavor Woods tastes like so got my spoon here let's show you what one of these guys look like I think this one was clear or orange in the beginning you can take a look at him or her whatever the case may be I think it's neuter in gummy bear land but let's see what these taste like oh yeah the flavored ones are super dangerous guys that kool-aid kool-aid concentrate really takes the edge off the vodka you can still tell us there because he'll they nearly tripled their size with vodka so you're gonna taste a little bit of boost but you could down a couple those and get blasted in a hurry and that's what little treats like this are for at a party when you're having a fun party but remember when you're enjoying this stuff you got to enjoy responsibility and if you got a guess that you're giving these two you also need to be good to them too and make sure they're not driving and being tanked up going home when they're paddling some of these buildings wow you can feel the warming going down on these guys but the way you take these the part of the way I like to take them apart is you take your jar here we'll clean this out before we do so and I like to take them in this jar here because it's got so that like moonshine look to it and it kind of makes them cool so you see we got real easy steps to make these dangerous little treat real tasty and if you've got folks that don't like that alcohol edge we know heading out how to take that alcohol edge off of these gummies and you can get your party on so guys thanks a million for watching I appreciate each and every one of you until the next DJ brew tube I guess this is kind of a mixed drink how-to I still haven't figured it out well maybe party libation how to or maybe it's not a libation because that means you're drinking um I don't know until the next ev32 thanks a million for watching and that's a big ass [Music]", "WcnQ0chDp_Y": "you majestic and magnificent rockets are defined as a vehicle propelled by thrust I won from burning onboard fuel one two three four five have any fuel and the most unlikely of all the mythical gummy bear so we've got three different versions of our gummybear rockets those are gonna go into these four inch rocket casings inside this is a tank of liquid oxygen a valve and the rocket engine with the gummy bears and then the rocket nozzle those are all the major components that go into a hybrid rocket now if you remember it's a hybrid rocket because we're feeding liquid oxygen through our fuel grain and that's what this giant tank is full of liquid oxygen literally some of the scariest stuff on earth to say this is flammable is really it's not accurate cuz this is what makes things flammable it is the enabler for burning which is exactly what it's doing in our Rockets with the LOX and rocket casing ready to roll cue the first fuel have act gummies and that pretty that is gorgeous so the gummy bear fuel grain is going into its housing there are a lot of fiddly bits that all have to work perfectly in the concert snap rings o rings rocket grands housing and everything and it all has to be properly assembled with the engine loaded and locked it's go time for launch this is the pre-launch setup we mount the rocket insert the altimeter on the descent parachute into the nose cone and then erect guide rail reminds me of something after that we D asked the area here we go because just as our bomb squad so the only ones qualified to do the final capping in of explosives our rocket techs here are the only ones qualified to work with the super unstable liquid oxygen once they have the LOX in place they put in the ignition system and the countdown sequence begins it ends of course with me counting from five to zero and I hit the launch button the moment I do an igniter starts a little fire in the base of the rocket at the same time a valve opens up and liquid oxygen begins to spray down the middle of the core of our fuel grain it is ignited by that flame and hopefully also in turn ignites to fill grain causing a chain reaction of explosive force that since the rocket skyward system is armed theoretically this is it will hand-packed gummies bears be a viable rocket fuel to one there we go see any smoke Hey come on baby that's the lights out that's the sound of not working miss the sound of failure well we just fired our first gummybear rocket roar these were the gummy bears were just jammed into a rocket grain shape with no other modification and we got a successful firing which is we heard it burn and shoot out some fire and then we started to hear the telltale sound of gummy bears individually peeling a hoof from the rocket grain and getting pooped out of the bottom of our rocket but not with enough force to actually lift this rocket we didn't get any else we didn't get one inch yeah the ignition flame appeared to light the locks oh nice you're eating it me I'd still sweet Wow let the loos pack flavor some fuel simply fell apart", "MTn3wB7_Jnc": "hey guys welcome back to our channel so today is gonna be a little bit of a different video we're gonna be testing out these little gummy bear molds that I got from my sister-in-law she actually sent them over for the kids for Christmas and yeah so we're gonna try them out we did actually film this video yesterday and I filmed it with my kids but the recipe didn't come out very well I think I might have made a mistake on making it so I'm gonna add a little bit more gelatin today and we're to see how these would come out so these molds you can buy on Amazon for about $8.99 I have mine here in my dish rack just dry now cuz we did use them like I said they were just kind of like jello just a tip on these gummy bears they're not like your regular gummy bears tell you buy at the store but they are a lot healthier I'm gonna be using four ingredients you can use even less if you want to just put juice with them but and you do have to keep them in the fridge and I read that they can last up to two weeks in the fridge and a container so they're not like the gummy bears that you get in a package but if your kids like little treats like that then it's perfect so what I'm gonna be using today is just this pineapple juice I got from Walmart you're gonna want so any kind of juice that's not from concentrate and then I did go ahead and go on Amazon and bought the vital proteins beef collagen it's like grass-fed beef gelatin but this is the one that they saw at Walmart so I bought this one you need three tablespoons of gelatin a cup of your juice but I'm gonna throw in some strawberries so I'm gonna have to blend them up I'm gonna put them in there then measure up a cup with the juice here then we're gonna blend it and then we're gonna put it in the saucepan we're gonna add this gelatin let it it says that it has like bloom so you're gonna see little cracks on top and when that happens then we're gonna bring it up to a simmer you're not going to want to boil the ingredients then we're gonna add our honey after we take it off the heat because you don't want to mess up any kind of benefits from the honey so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna pour it in the molds put it in the fridge for two hours and we'll show you how they come out we'll let you know if they come out really good I did see a bunch of cool like health ones you could just put like turmeric in these molds and honey you can make like cool little gummies for one like your stick or anything like that but today we're going to be doing strawberry pineapple gummy bears so let's get started [Music] so I just removed these from the bridge and it's been a little over two hours I tried one and it actually came out pretty easily this is what they look like they're super cute and the true test is gonna be the taste test so let you know they taste [Music] all right [Music] I don't phony [Music] okay good [Music] I'm Annina Seth keep them in the fridge for two weeks but these wouldn't last two minutes and my head yeah I like these I don't usually know as honey baby house honey well if I had one kid this would be like the best like your first kid when you don't give them junk after you have five it's like I think the two tablespoons of honey was perfect well I don't the rejects so there you have it your gummy bears let us know if you've made these before and if you have come up below on any recipes that you might have that are really good and we'd love to see them Thank You Carol and Fernando and the kids for sending these cool little molds and yeah if there's any other things you want to try out go ahead and comment below and we'll see you guys in the next one says Diego always says peace out and God bless Turkish work it [Music]", "-xix6u2w-uc": "guys do i look like wendy from peter pan right

little treat in the kitchen we're making champagne gummy bears let's go i'm so excited i'm gonna set these down i made gummy bears once before on my channel it was weird anyway all of my friends and family know my two favorite things on earth are gummy bears and champagne that's it that's all i need so let's combine them there's a candy brand called sugarfina they have champagne gummy bears they're amazing so i'm going to try to make it myself so yeah if you want to see how to make champagne gummy bears it's supposed to be super easy then just keep watching [Music] so for this you actually don't need very many things you just need champagne you need sugar and you need gelatin oh and also gummy bear molds hello duh for right now i have one cup of the root rose is reducing over medium heat once this has kind of reduced down a little bit we'll add another cup and a half and now i'm going to do just a regular champagne i figured it would be fun to try both again i'm absolutely terrified of doing this part oh my god am i doing it i'm doing it oh wow i'm a beast nice i took off the last one with a cork opener i know that's super not how you're supposed to do that but i did it so one cup yes i feel like i should pour myself a glass while i'm making this what do you guys think it is time for some champagne i love to drink champagne everything's looking good these guys are bubbling i'm enjoying my day how's everyone doing are we all doing well okay so let me tell you guys a little bit about the gelatin we're using today agar agar what i'll name my firstborn it is a vegetable gelatin substitute the difference here this is plant-based it's made from red algae without any artificial chemical ingredient regular gelatin is made from skin bones tendons and cartilage of livestock animals yuck that's kind of gross this has fibers calcium iron vitamins so yeah this should be interesting i'm excited to try this this one looks like it's reduced so i'm going to go ahead and add a cup and a half more so the rose one is doing a nice job here so we are going to go ahead and add the gelatin and also the sugar so for the gelatin you're doing one fourth of a cup okay and now let's also add while that's doing that let's add a cup of sugar there we go so we are going to continue to whisk this until everything dissolves and until it really thickens up so now i'm going to do the exact same thing over here for our regular champagne gummies fourth a cup of the gelatin pour that in got it all over me and also a cup of sugar now i'm just gonna go back and forth kind of whisking these guys until they look ready to me i guess take our lovely reduced mixture here this is the rose one and i have out our gummy bear molds and i'm going to use a dropper now this might take an eternity uh to do a dropper and do this but i'm willing okay so let's begin so what's interesting about agar agar is that am i saying that right agar agar whatever is that the freezing point of it you know when the molds get hard is just room temperature so these are already ready to go so that's pretty cool that you can make these so fast i'm telling you these are already ready oops look he's already ready to eat i'm going to eat him interesting but delicious i'm gonna keep making some more i'll be back okay guys here they are uh these are the champagne ones these are the rose ones aren't they kind of cool nice so i just want to show you what they look like if you decide you want to coat them in sugar it gives them obviously a little extra sweetness but they're still just as cute look at that guy these also have a little bit more of a melt in your mouth kind of more of a jello texture than a traditional gummy bear these turned out really well i'm actually really impressed with how quickly the agar agar solidifies just at room temperature it's super fast and yeah these are really good it says that these are best kept in the refrigerator i like the regular champagne ones a lot more than rose ones i wonder if i could toss them and eat them in the sky i'll get it oh close that was way off i don't know what that was nope nope that was just straight up and down that was way behind my head nice i did it that is it for this video thank you so much for watching and i will go ahead and see you guys again in my next one bye", "xy8FJSBzcWA": "hey sugar geeks today we're making a super fun and bouncy rose wine gummy these little guys are super easy to make are perfect for kick toppers and tastes just like rose a rose a all-day y'all okay so the first thing we're to do is add our wine to a large measuring cup we're gonna need one and a half cups wherever however much you have in your bottles then we're gonna add in our sugar be aware that you're lying me pizza when you have this layer sugar is honestly totally optional it just makes the wine gummies a little bit sweeter all right so now we're gonna add in four packs of gelatin and you just want to sprinkle that over the surface and try not to like just dump it all in otherwise it's gonna make clothes so I'll just like push down and then add some more and this is called blooming and what it does is its allowing the gelatin to absorb liquid so if you needed more more gummies than just this you could just multiply this batch one and a half cups a liquid beer wine juice whatever you need and then we're gonna let this bloom for five minutes okay it's been five minutes now I'm gonna go ahead and microwave this for 30 seconds and then 15 second increments until all of the gelatin is all melted and there's no granules go inevitably there's going to be some foam on the top you just scoop that off with a spoon if you don't scoop it off it will stay in your gummies so depending on if you want foam works great for beer gummies not so great for wine gummies and then we're gonna add in our corn syrup this is what makes the gummies gummy just mixing until dissolved if you don't want to use corn syrup you can totally use honey just keep in mind that honey is going to give it a honey flavor so it'd be like honey wine honey rose a I mean that kind of sounds amazing so Rose a-after do you add all of the gelatin and stuff it actually ends up being kind of oranjee looking so I have a little bit of water here and I'm going to add a drop of electric pink and the reason I'm putting it in the water first is because the gel does not like to dissolve and alcohol weird I'm just gonna add a couple drops and that just brings like that rose pink color back all right so now we're ready to pour our gummy mixture into the mold I just got these off of Amazon you can use ice mold silicone molds whatever kind of sphere molds you have just kind of squeegeeing the extra jell-o mixture down so I don't have any big gloves you'd be surprised how far one and a half cups of wine will take you can make several types of bowls if you end up with like spilling a ton of this you know like over the edge you can't actually remelt it so once it sets you can just remelt it in the microwave crazy I know all right our dummies have been chilling in the fridge literally look at that so cute yeah look how cute those are so that is how you make ROS a wine gummies be sure to check out next week's episode of sugar geek show where we turn this recipe into a rose a jello faultline cake yep that's really happening thanks for watching see you guys next week bye", "tczNwJMnG6M": "[Music] today I'm showing you three ways to use agar agar if you've never heard of agar before it's a plant-based gelling agent that's actually made from seaweed and it's most commonly used as a plant-based alternative to gelatin I partnered up with a company called living Djinn who sent me their agar agar to use in all three of these recipes there are a small Korean based health food startup and they've been really patient with me over the last few weeks while I took some time to test out the quality of the product I found that the results I've gotten have been really consistent I also found that I didn't end up using as much of the living gin agar as I have had to use of other brands in the past nor did I have to boil it as long to get good gelling results so if you want to try out any of these recipes or any other agar based recipes at home I would definitely recommend the agar from living Jin I've placed a link in the description below if you want to check it out for the first recipe I'm making gummy bears so most gummy candies are actually made with a ton of gelatin so that can be one kind of off-putting and to really restricting for people with dietary restrictions preferences or religious beliefs so you can actually use agar as a replacement all you need is 250 millilitres of fruit juice six grams of agar [Music] and 25 grams of sugar mix this all together in a pot and boil for one to two minutes it's important to boil any mixture with agar in it because the boiling activates the gelling properties so make sure you get it up to a rolling boil then all you need are some of these super cute gummy bear molds I just got them on Amazon and they came with these little droppers so you can transfer your gummy bear mixture into the molds set them aside to chill in the fridge for about 15 to 20 minutes and once they're firm to the touch pop them out of the mold [Music] then you can repeat this process for whatever flavor of gummy candy you'd like one thing I hear often when people make egg are based gummies is that it's hard to get the same true texture but I found a super simple solution to this you just have to dehydrate them a little all I normally do is leave them out on a drying rack for a day or two to dehydrate slightly and then you end up with that really nice chewy gummy bear texture [Music] another great way to use Egger is in puddings panna cotta or mousse today I'm making a matcha green-tea mousse you'll need 150 grams of white chocolate chopped and set aside in a large bowl pour 500 milliliters of coconut milk and 85 grams of honey into a pot and bring to a simmer [Music] pour the simmering liquid over the white chocolate and stir to combine in a separate pop place six grams of agar 7 grams of matcha green-tea powder and three to five tablespoons of water bring this to a boil for one to two minutes for the green tea mixture into the coconut mixture and stir [Music] to get a really smooth consistency blend the mixture on high then transfer it to individual serving bowls and set in the fridge once the matcha mousse is set you can serve it as is or top it with a sprinkle of matcha or sesame seeds [Music] next and probably one of my favorite ways to use Egger is by using it to make gourmet or molecular style recipes for this recipe I'm making grapefruit pearls start by pouring about a liter of neutral flavored oil into a tall container and placing this in the freezer for about one to two hours once your oil is cold get 250 milliliters of grapefruit juice into a pot along with 2 grams of agar powder [Music] bring this up to a boil now for the fun part using a squeeze bottle or syringe stream the grape fruit mixture into the oil and droplets [Music] strain the pearls out from the oil and rinse in cold water you can make these pearls with most liquids I've done these with honey balsamic vinegar and sriracha just to name a few special thanks again to living gin for sponsoring this video if you want to try it any of these recipes make sure to check out the link in the description box below and if you're lucky enough to live in LA you can now purchase the living gin agar offline at the Little Tokyo marketplace Los Angeles I'll post links to their social below as well because they post lots of cool recipes so you might want to check that out and as always thanks for watching and if you liked the video consider subscribing and connecting with me elsewhere at Kate you see creative [Music]", "cFwlIAzxTGc": "[Music] hi welcome back to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz and this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular welcome back so today I am going to show you how to make these awesome Jolly Rancher gummies from actual Jolly Ranchers that's right so I make these with canister up you can also do them with the can of sugar if you want to know how to make those I do have videos they're made from textures there is a specific one can of sugar and then the other one for the can of syrup is can of flour powdered sugar and syrup not well show you how to make the syrup if you'd like so from the actual gummy art from Jolly Ranchers I've made these gummies and I'm going to show you just how to do that so it's usually I'm going to jump right into those ingredients and what we need to put that together and get it all put together for you so you can make these awesome candies well one thing I did I want to tell you so in the recipe I used three and a half tablespoons of unflavored gelatin I would recommend using four tablespoons of unflavored gelatin to the same three quarter cups of liquid so I I will put the correction in the ingredients in the comments I do sorry I'm they turned it a little bit softer than probably what I like so I would go with four tablespoons of the unflavored gelatin all right so now we'll jump into those ingredients and get right to her alrighty so for our Jolly Rancher gummies what we're going to need is about twenty of your preferred flavour of Jolly Ranchers so I'm going to use the blue raspberry and peeled of course take off graphics you're going to need a quarter cup of can of syrup that we're going to mix with this then for our candy syrup we are going to need one cup of white sugar regular sugar and 1/4 cup of can of syrup and a quarter cup of regular light corn syrup 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid and a quarter cup of water for syrup then we're going to need three and sorry three and a half tablespoons to four so if you've got the packages of the gelatin you can just use the four packets they got a little bit off one you'll be good and 3/4 of a cup of water for your gelatin cold it needs to be very cold and then for our equipment we are going to need a candy thermometer a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler just use a pot where another heat safe Bowl will fit on top and that will suffice another pot for your candy syrup a couple of spatulas and then your bottles if you've got the bottles for dispensing your syrup if you don't have these guys these are great things if not you just use your eye droppers you've got those and of course your molds and that's everything we need to get started so let's jump right in and get it going alright so our very first step we want to do is bloom our gelatin so you are going to take your three and a half tablespoons and you're going to sprinkle it over your liquid you want to kind of get it all mixed around and then you're gonna get that you're gonna mix this in your gelatin into your liquid so you don't have any lumps and while you're mixing this this is a good yet to know whether your gelatin is a good strength or that it's not too old while you're mixing this it should already start to gel and while you're mixing it it should how to get turns to about the consistency of applesauce and that's how you know your gelatin is good and then we're going to just put that aside to bloom or total ready to loot till we need it now we are going to melt our our Jolly Ranchers and our corn syrup so we are going to melt our Jolly Ranchers and a quarter cup of our corn syrup all on our double boil just don't forget to put water in your bottom of your double boiler I've done it how come I plug it in hold on alright so we're gonna turn our heat on to medium medium or medium-high and we're gonna get our candy put your Jolly Ranchers into the pot mine got a little stuck in the bowl here got a lot of humidity too don't want to give it up gotcha and we're gonna put in our quarter cup of corn syrup our can of corn syrup and that eats up everything will begin to melt the Jolly Ranchers will start to melt you just want to try and get the candies covered and covered in the syrup just start getting things moving around but just going to continue to stir and this until the until your candies though the Jolly Ranchers are completely melted so it does take a while for the candies for the Jolly Ranchers to melt just be patient it does get kind of goofy and glumpy don't you can see that but just be patient it will all nose what I do is I let it sit for about a minute or so let it get heated up and then I stir it around breaking trying to break it up mush it down you just don't want to really overwork it does that just continue to do that your lumpy mess will turn into a nice syrup will see very shortly all right so now my candy start my Jolly Ranchers are all melted so you can see that a little better so we're just gonna set this off to the side for about five minutes to let that cool down before we add in our gelatin because if we add in our gelatin now it'll be too hot and it can break through gelatin that's a lot of problems that happens with with it so the next stage I'm just gonna let that cool down and we'll add in our gelatin and get that melted in and then we'll make that by the candy syrup and get it all put together so now that my syrup is cooled down it's time to add in the gelatin and I like to just do this and cut it up into smaller pieces and then we'll just plop we're all in and get that melting now you'll find if it's not melting you can turn your heat on to low put it back on the double boiler auctioneers probably enough heat from the water still from the double boiler to to melt the gelatin if it's not hot enough right still Cece was started melting because we have the cold temperature and the warm you can kind of have a separation here but once everything comes to the same temperatures and everything will mix together so you may find that your candy is kind of is starting to solidify getting a little clumpy well the gelatin is not really is not fully melting if that's the case then turn your heat on to low or just want to gently heat the reheat that up you just have to be patient with this because it is gonna take a few about five or five minutes or so for everything to come together properly you might think oh no it's not working but don't worry be patient so you're going to continue to gently stir this over the low heat until everything your Jolly Ranchers and your gelatin of all melts together in one even uniform syrup and there's nothing sticking to the bottom of the pot yeah once everything is melted together and everything's one uniform texture and color and there's nothing sticking to the bottom and now if you find here you may want to add a little bit of additional food coloring because the blue with the green it's gonna muddle that blue a little bit so if you do want that with more intense blue like your Jolly Rancher go ahead and add a little bit more blue food coloring it's just exactly what I'm gonna do here so you took the one out of much just one drop will make one to two drops at the mouth you can see the difference there with one drop me get that mixed in so that's a much nicer blue how well you can see that so I skip it too much then it's gonna I'm gonna spill it and not like we haven't seen me see me do that before so we want to see what the color is gonna look like you just drop it onto something white there and I'll just see what it looks like so I'm happy with that color goody-goody I'm just gonna set this off to the side and we'll get our candy syrup started alright so for our candy syrup part portion we're gonna pour in our 1 cup of sugar our quarter cup of cannister up our quarter cup of light corn syrup and our quarter cup of our sorry our half a teaspoon of citric acid and our quarter cup of water and we're gonna get stirred together so you just want to get it mixed together so the water and Evert the sugar in the syrups are all incorporated and then we're going to turn our heat on to medium high forever this pillar so we're going to continue to stir this until until it begins to boil then if you have any duty sugar sugar sugar sugar crystals are so acceptance I just want to scrape that off or get a pastry brush and hot water and just wash down the stop then as soon as your syrup begins to boil you're going to stop stirring and we're going to watch your candy thermometer and we're going to cook the syrup to 260 degrees Fahrenheit and that's it just the letter go now periodically don't forget about your jelly the gelatin and your candy syrup you want to go around and stir that because it we can do start to solidify around the edges if it's like to pull off too much solid once once go around and just make sure that it's all still doing good but don't worry it'll get remelted once it gets out we added into the hot candy syrup whose life my candy almost up to temperature once you hit 260 you want to remove it from your meat immediately keep the candy thermometer attached because you want to wait until the syrup comes down to about 240 before we add in our other mixture the best is that you have a stone or marble surface to put it on is the best thing it draws the heat out quickly and and it doesn't get the surface doesn't get hot at all if not just put it off to the side burner and wait until your heat comes down to 240 all right so now my temperatures come down remove your candy thermometer grab your can you stir up your gelatin and your Jolly Rancher syrup and now we're going to gently pour it into our candy pot candy syrup here it'll probably bubble up a little bit and then you want to gently mix this and and continue stirring until it's all combined and you want to try to stir it gently to incorporate as little air MIDI as little air bubbles as you can but we need to make sure everything gets stirred there we go and once you're all good with air we're gonna get this poured into our bottles or you're just gonna use your dispensers your little eye droppers so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to pour it through a little strainer this isn't necessary if you've got one great if not don't worry about it so because it gets so hot these gelatin may break a little bit you get that little bit of whiteness I can't really turn the pot that way for you but if you do you can run it through a strainer just so that doesn't get in and if not no worries it'll all kind of go up to the top I'm just gonna pour this in I don't want any left in here now one thing you can do is you can fill up if you want to know if your gelatin it's gonna set correctly is you can just set up one or two cavities in your in your candy mold put it in the fridge and it should start to solidify very fairly quickly within about five minutes or so it should start to set so you'll know if it's still really gooey and tacky then you may have difficult study let it leave it for twenty if after twenty minutes it's still not setting then the gelatin has gotten too hot or it is not it's not some notch Ellington's are all the same strength so it may not be strong enough you can remelt you can add that back into the pot and add in about another half a tablespoon more of gelatin so this way it saves you a lot of time and this has got to cool down anyway because it the bottles are too hot to handle even if I use the oven mitt you don't want to do it when it's super hot because what will happen is it'll warp your bottle and it'll screw them up so one of those will end up leaking on you so you don't want to do that so while my bottles are all that while I'm waiting for my syrup to call I threw a couple into the fridge so I'm gonna see how they're gonna set up now I wasn't setting you may find your bottles because the bubbles will start to come to the top and instead if any gelatinous broke them out White's gonna come to the top as well so what you can just do is get a little spoon and just scrape that tops kind of skin right off of there oh yeah that way it's not gonna end up into your candy and make it muddled want to have a nice clearer looking syrup all right so I did check my candies they are starting to set up nicely because the syrup is hotter it's taking them longer and I don't want to leave this get too cold so yeah so the velocity is really you just distribute it into the molds if it's still a little hot for your hands full you can use paper towels on it which is exactly what I'm gonna do cuz that's too small just hold up some paper towel to put around it I thought I don't go with the oven mitts because I find that they're heavy and clunky and that's it just disperse it into your molds and put them in the fridge for about two hours for them to fully set and I'll come back we'll pop these out to see what these bad boys looked and chase like I tasted the syrup and oh my god it's so good it tastes just like a jolly rancher now if you find that your candies don't set you put them in the fridge for two hours they come out and they're still sticky you can't get them out of the mold don't panic put them into the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours let me get good and frozen and then pop them out so I don't you have to do one mold at a time take them out one at a time pop them into a double boiler remelt it add another half a tablespoon to a tablespoon will be good enough bloom gelatin and that will fix that problem and the same thing if you you've gone you've made them set them up and they're just way too jelly they're very very jelly to sick you can still you remem and add in a little bit about a quarter of a cup of liquid and that should take care of that all right so I will be back when these are set and we'll pop them out and see how pretty they look all right so welcome back here so my gummies I have them sitting in the fridge just over two hours and now we're gonna take them out so as you see first it looks like they're gonna be sticky but you just got to pull around the sides and we'll start to pull away as long as they're doing that and you can pull them out you're good you're gonna slay them on your parchment paper or stand them up if you can some of your candies molds are able to stand up others won't so I bought these guys on their sides and then also when it's warm especially it's warm I only take out one or two molds at a time to take them out and leave the rest of the fridge so that they don't warm up too much if I don't have a hard time getting them out of the molds and then I'm just gonna let these little guys dry for 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go yeah if there is still a little bit sticky once you've dried them you can toss them in a little bit of cornstarch so you don't want to do too much usually what I'll do just coat my hands in them and then run my coat my hands and cornstarch and then just run my hands through the candy and just kind of get a very light coating on them the other thing is you could do the same thing with oil so if you want to just take some cooking water olive oil coat your hands to them rub it in and then just gently go over your candies look at a little bit of an oil that will help them to stop from sticking as well and there you've got it Jolly Rancher canna gummies look at that baby and these guys taste so good oh I tried one earlier I don't know if I'm gonna get these to drying time get them fully dried they're so good but anyway guys that's it for that tutorial I'll be back to say goodbye and yeah that's about it oh one thing is gonna tell you so if you tried taking them out of the molds and they weren't coming out they're too sticky as I said don't panic put them in the freezer let them freeze up for a couple of hours pop them out put them into a double boiler let them melt down again and then bloom a quarter or sorry a half a tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of liquid blue matte add that in and that will take care of that problem recast them and you should be good that's awesome thing we working with gelatin and the either if there is a mistake you can usually fix it as long as you haven't burnt it oh and remember that this version of the recipe is just for playing gummies we are not going to sugar or citric acid these if you do they're going to melt I will do another version of the Jolly Ranchers of the sour version for you okay so don't add your sugar and citric acid to this they will melt so that is my tutorial on a can of Jolly Rancher gummies I hope you enjoyed that and if you have any questions as always please don't hesitate to put them in the comments and as I said in the beginning of the video in case you just skipped right over it use four tablespoons of gelatin versus three and a half it'll make that little bit of difference or a little bit softer than I probably would have liked but if you like a softer gummy go the screen 1/2 but if you want that more firm gummy go with the four and you'll be good to go check out that baby's its see-through ish it's got that clear candy looking it tastes just like a jolly rancher it's so good so please let me know if you give this a try I'd love to hear from you on which flavor you prefer and once again thanks so much for watching you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]", "YFKNLym1r3w": "what is up ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it's your boy goblin and today we're coming in with a hoot and a holler hey we're coming in with something a little different a bit of an educational video if you will now hope you guys enjoyed this one drop a like if you do and without further ado let's dive right into it so first and foremost i want to clarify why this video is being made right i get a lot of people coming into my twitter dms or my instagram dm's and they send me pictures of edibles they get and they're these like nerds robes or these gummies or all of these different things and you know up until recently i didn't have as much knowledge on the topic i guess you could say as i did now right like i never really bothered to actually learn much or educate myself because i kind of stopped buying edibles for a while but as i got back into edibles you know i kind of started learning more about what the current street edibles are like and listen alright ladies and gentlemen there's a trend going on that when i mentioned it on stream the other day the vast majority of people in chat not the vast majority but a fair bit of people were like what are you talking about like oh i didn't know that and today we're going to address that right i'm going to give you guys some tips on how to spot a fake edible what a fake edible even necessarily is but first and foremost right i think it's important to note that there's really only two cases where you should even be buying edibles right a go to a dispensary dispensaries have great edibles that are made in ways that a lot of street edibles just can't be made because it requires equipment that is so expensive no dude in his garage is going to have it 99 of the time right or b buy it off a friend of yours who makes it right if you are buying a street edible and it advertises a milligram amount 99 of the time that is wildly inaccurate nothing close to the real dosage right but we'll get to that part later because the real thing i want to push here is like folks make your own edibles okay before i get dive into how to really spot these edibles it's so simple to literally just get together with your homies smoke some weed and cook edibles it's some of the most fun i've ever had in terms of anything weed related making edibles is a blast dude if you've never done it before it's literally it's so easy dude brownies are the easiest thing to make give it a go okay but now let's get into the the real beef of this video okay so first and foremost there's something i want to highlight right not all edibles are made the same way right there's some edibles that are sold on the street you know specifically if you're buying a pre-packaged edible if you buy nerds ropes i guarantee this is probably what you're getting 99 of the time right i know these are a huge trend right now everyone's eating these [ __ ] nerds ropes dude there's probably a few of you guys smacking that [ __ ] right now while you're watching this video okay listen i'm on to you okay i'm on your ass now all right listen so there's different ways that edibles are made edibles of course can be cooked and that's more common when you've got like a brownie or a cookie you know they take an oil or a can of butter and they actually cook something but there's a new and kind of i wouldn't say new but a what's becoming more common trend which is spraying right and a lot of people when i mentioned this on stream the other day this is the whole reason i'm making this video a lot of people didn't know this exists what people will do is they will take distillate and just spray it on the edibles you take a [ __ ] piece of wax paper and you lay it out on a table right and you take nerds ropes obviously are such an ideal candidate for this because you could just put them so tightly together and just spray them down and waste no distillate right so you take this wax paper and you lay these [ __ ] edibles out you lay some let's say you go buy some candy you know you go buy some cheap wholesale candy you lay it out and you just spray the [ __ ] out of it it's so much quicker than actually cooking and think about it for a minute do you really think your plug knows some guy who is handcrafting some [ __ ] nerds ropes one by one in his garage or has like a nerd's rope machine listen there's machines that do a lot of things but there's no machine making nerds ropes and there's also no guy dumb enough to hand roll a bunch of nerds ropes when he knows he could just buy them and spray them and sell them for a shitload of money right you have to understand that this is a very common trend in the comment section i'm actually going to link an article that talks about this right there's a couple articles i found i'm gonna link you guys can actually read some stuff hey you don't gotta believe me that's fine i'm not always the most trustworthy source hey but these articles are okay these will tell you some facts right but moving on from the whole sprayed part there's a couple prop well not moving on but there's a couple problems with it a you don't know what the [ __ ] the dosage is right you have no idea what these people are putting on you can't dose it they're not actually cooking it the spray is uneven but that's really the least of the concerns of the sprayed edible because you have to look more at the fact of like what are they actually spraying onto this product right when something is cooked like you know let's say let's say someone takes an oil or like a can of butter and they make a brownie or a cookie or something like that with it typically you're you're more going to be questioning the strength of it you're not going to be concerned about a synthetic or something fake in it but when you spray an edible you are opening up the door for synthetics to be sprayed on it and this is becoming a more common thing people don't realize that not all edibles even have thc in them sometimes you can get an edible that is just sprayed with synthetic [ __ ] right k2 for example they spray that right that's not like an actual plant they spray some plant matter and you smoke that [ __ ] right they can do the same thing with edibles if they really [ __ ] want to right they can spray it with some synthetic chemical [ __ ] that you don't know what it does to you you don't know where it's from and there's a million different chemicals that they can choose to spray on these edibles and that's why you have to have due diligence when you're buying and you have to look at what you're purchasing and honestly in my opinion the brownie in a ziploc bag is a hundred times safer than your prepackaged nerds rope or sour patch kid is ever going to be okay because like nobody like sure there might be exceptions i know there's of course gonna be that one guy in the comment section he's like well goblin you know i actually have a sour patch kids nerds rope factory in the shed in my backyard and i have over 15 employees churning out nine different machines of nerd ropes you know what good for you you're the one in a million all right but the rest of the people watching this video they aren't in that scenario they're buying it from some guy who is spraying some hoopla right they're buying it from some guy and they're not buying it directly from that guy either it's passed through a hands on hand so you're getting marked up sprayed [ __ ] you're not you're not even getting a good deal on this you have to realize your plug like if you hit up your plug and you asked to buy like a hundred of these edibles in bulk i guarantee you're gonna get some ridiculous price that makes you realize wait a minute how does that even work and i'll tell you how it's probably sprayed specifically if [ __ ] are selling these little nerds ropes or whatever man are these other candies that are on you know trending nowadays you know you go on tick tock and you see these people claiming they they make these edibles you know oh look at these candies brother just spray that [ __ ] dude 99 of the time they don't actually cook something into it but even when they do cook something into it here's the next concern the next concern is that there's no actual viable way of really testing a street edible right you you can't really know you know nobody's taking dispensary weed where they know the exact percentage and cooking it in edibles they're taking street weed that's never been tested and cooking it into an edible that that that's then also never been tested so they really don't know what the dosage is in these you know they could tell you how much they put into it and you can maybe ballpark it but when you get something that is packaged and your plug says yeah it's exactly this dosage don't believe them right if you've got a plug it just tells you yeah these [ __ ] are strong eat half that's honestly probably more reliable going to be a better product than the guy who's trying to sell you some thc milligram that he doesn't actually know exists right so always should have your due diligence and once again this should just be a an advertisement to cook with your homies dude go make some edibles hey go hop in your group chat right now all you need is literally like like a half ounce an ounce and you can make a small little batch of edibles bro that's all you need you and the homies will have a good [ __ ] time you know what i'm saying listen and you don't even need good kush you can get mids bro you don't even need good [ __ ] but hey that's for another video all right another thing that's very important to talk about specifically i see this on some of these right this is a small little disclaimer that we're going to talk about here is i see some edibles advertise activation time and that then and there should tell you to run if if there's ever a packaging on an edible you purchase that says oh man you'll be stoned in 60 minutes oh dude man activates in 45 minutes dude everyone like it's your digestion dude like everyone digests products differently the only way you could advertise that is if you're spraying it with some boo-boo [ __ ] that does actually activate that quick but if it's actually cooked into the product and you have to digest it right that's a whole different story right that's a whole different story and obviously you can't advertise activation time like that so just what i'm trying to say here in this video guys is is really think before you purchase an edible and it's really sad that the street market has become this way you know when i was young and i first started smoking it was just you'd buy some mids and you buy some mid wax and edibles was something you made with your friends out of one of those two things nobody really sold them unless it was your homie with a tray of brownies who was selling them right pre-packaged edibles were unheard of around me right now that's like the norm everyone's selling this crazy carts [ __ ] fake edible [ __ ] it's crazy man and that's why that's why i make some of these kind of informational videos just spread the word about it dude hey man listen if you're a plug out there selling these shits dude you're guilty okay you should feel terrible about yourself but either way hope you guys enjoyed this video drop a like if you did hope you guys learned something let me know in the comments if you did thank you guys for

regular Cola bottle gummies into you guessed it infused Cola bottle bellies here's what you're going to need two tablespoons of warm water four ounces of Cola flavored gummies one-and-a-half teaspoons of gelatin 1/4 teaspoon of potassium sorbate mixture which I will link how to make below one to two teaspoons of a herbal tincture if desired and a soda bottle mold the first step is to sprinkling a gelatin over the warm water there's no need to stir it just leave it to sit for about five minutes so it can bloom now you can take your Cola gummies and cut them so the lighter color is separated from the darker color place the lighter colored gummies into a dish and add about a quarter of your gelatin mixture then place it in the microwave for about 30 to 40 seconds until it melts once it's melted pour in some your tincture and then stir it in I'm going to be placing my mixture into a squeeze bottle and then putting it into a cup filled with warm water to keep it warm and liquid until I have everything ready to go now repeat this process with the other half of the gummies you'll be using your remaining amount of tincture and all of your gelatin my tincture is having some difficulties binding to the gummy mixture so I'm adding in about a teaspoon of lecithin to help it emulsify now I'm going to pour in both mixture at the same time putting the light color on the top and the dark color on the bottom once that's done I'll place them in the fridge or the freezer for about in half an hour so I can take them out of their mold [Music] I want some of them to be coated in sugar so I just filled a little bag with some sugar and shook them around and then I will leave these to sit out for about 24 hours so any excess moisture can evaporate that's it now your gummies are ready to be enjoyed [Music] thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe [Music]", "_XVNvnQLo44": "hey thanks for joining me today I want to show you how to make gummies a lot of people ask about hey do you have a gummy bear mold well essentially all of our chocolate molds are gummy bear mold so you can really make any shape that you want to so what I want to show you today is you're doing this from scratch we're not using a box mix of any sort so the powder gelatin that we have here at sweet wise is a really great deal because you can get a whole pound and then we're going to be using some of the sweet wise flavorings those are all natural and then the citric acid that we have here as well so the recipe is pretty basic I'm just going to use a cup of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugar and then I'm going to use four tablespoons of gelatin but before I get the rip to the rest of it like with the flavor and color and everything I want to give you a few tips on mixing this what I did I went ahead and did a cup of hot water with my sugar because when you pour the sugar into the cold water then it takes a little bit more time to dissolve that granulated sugar and you really you know want to dissolve that before you get to the gelatin it just makes it a little bit better so I went ahead and this hot water that I mixed with the sugar and I also went ahead and mix my color because let me show you this if you add the color I'm going to do red in this one just to show you the difference if you do the color in here then it can be kind of gloppy and it's a little bit hard to mix into cold water as well you have these little spots that don't mix as well so when I mix it with the hot water this is essentially the same thing with a different color okay so you can see how much clearer it is when I use hot water mix the color in and the sugar that's all I am right here 1 cup of water 2/3 cup of sugar and the coloring and then it's cooled back down to room temperature now we can add the gelatin and I've got 4 tablespoons of the sweet wise gelatin and I'm just going to go ahead and sprinkle this slowly on top and I'm not going to stir it quite yet I wanted to start absorbing all of that liquid and you'll notice that it starts to bloom is what it's called it starts to absorb that liquid over time and once that's all absorbed then we can melt it so that'll probably take a minute or two so we'll just leave that alone and come back to it okay so my gelatin is all dissolved so now I'm just going to add a teaspoon of the lemon flavoring now this is an actual lemon oil so if I was going to use like this cherry flavoring over here in the red I would probably want to do two teaspoons in that but the lemon is so much stronger I'm just going to do one teaspoon in that give it a little stir and then I'm going to take it over to the microwave should take about 20 seconds and then it will probably be ready all right so I'm going to check it give it a stir I think this needs a little bit more time I'm going to give it about another 15 seconds you want to make sure that you don't overdo it on the first round because you you can scorch some spots you don't want to do that so this is ready usually I have a lot more foam on the top and this this batch turned out really nice but what you want to do before you start using this is just kind of skim this off just kind of gather it off to the side and take a spoon then just kind of discard it off to the side that way you can have a nice clear gummy okay you don't have to have every single particle out of there but just having the bulk of it out really helps now you can pour it right out of here it has a nice funnel but that really only works well if you have a bigger cavity like this if you're doing something more finely detailed like these teddy bears or these little gems I really like to put it in a squeeze bottle so let me just go ahead and pour that in here and since it's nice and warm that'll go quickly if this does cool off you can pop it back in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds and it'll be a lot more fluid again you may have a few little leaks in this but I wouldn't worry about that too much okay so let me show you about preparing these you really don't need to oil these or anything but it does help but come out a little bit more easily I'll show you an example these have not been oiled they sat at room temperature about 20 minutes this one was oiled and this one was not so you'll see I'm just gonna take a toothpick and I'm going to kind of start the edge and then get my finger under there and pull it out that one pops out really easily this one will come out easily but not as easily as the oiled one this one does have a little bit more shine to it if you'll notice but what I want to warn you about is if you do add like a spray in here and we just do one of these down here like a quick spray like this all these bubbles that are here we'll come out in the surface of the jello so you want to avoid that by just kind of brushing it around or maybe taking paper towel and get that excess out of there so just to show you how to fill these I want to fill this one just to the edge these bigger ones I pop in the fridge for like 20 minutes and they're fully set if you left it at room temperature I'm guessing this would be at least an hour these take about 20 minutes these little bitty cavities they take about 20 minutes at room temperature and then they pop right out and I'll show you one of these as well you see how easy that comes right out and then of course the rubber Ducky's it which is why I did the yellow with the lemon if you want to do that for a baby shower again this is a little bit bigger cavity so if you want to pop that in the fridge for about 20 minutes that would come out as well but you want to avoid like over filling these you can take like a bench scraper or something to clean that up but if it forms on there then it's just a little bit ugly and then you can always go back and trim it up with scissors but that's just more work so I just say use the squeeze bottle and make it a little bit easier on yourself one more tip if you want to make the sour is to use citric acid now this is very very strong so don't use it straight you're going to just really give somebody a heart attack I do like 5 or 6 parts of sugar just granulated sugar to one part of citric acid so if you're using a teaspoon measure I have two teaspoon measure whatever that's fine too but what I like to do so like these already done you can put this like in a little salt shaker if you want to but I don't like to sprinkle it right out of the container because it'll just be too heavy so just put a little bit in my hand and then I also don't sprinkle down close to the piece I'm doing it just kind of it sticks too much in little globules if you'll raise your hand a little bit higher and just kind of sprinkle from up high then it gives you a little bit more even coating and it's also not quite as strong as if you did it really really close so there's a really great easy way to make gummies you can make them the regular way or the sour way I really like that you can kind of customize your color if you do want to like for a baby shower for a wedding or for a birthday you can kind of make the colors and flavors work to your advantage rather than just buying something that's pre-made plus just having the custom shapes and different sizes people are really going to be impressed that you made these so give it a try thanks for watching have fun with it you", "yYZH7B498gE": "[THEME - \"GUMMI BEARS\"] [HOOVES GALLOPING] THEME SONG: Dashing and\ndaring, courageous

you so much for joining and first of all I would like to thank these people have donated to my patreon account thank you thank you very much means the world to me and your support with and your support for my channel thank you thank you so today what I'm going to bring to you quite a few quite a few people have asked for this recipe wasn't 100% sure if I could do it but that would be the old magic me I was able to pull this out so what we are going to make is a soda pop candy gummies and I'm gonna be making this with can of sugar and can of syrup I'm recipes for those links for those videos I cut down in the description for you and check these that I made these ones 7up and they look so cool of course I threw my two-tone as always check that out these are fun to makes a little bit different than the other recipes that we've done so just another way of doing things so you can use any pop at all rip your cherry coke whatever floats your boat you can go with I'm just happen to pick the 7up and yeah that's everything and they actually taste like seven real some enough whoo so I hope you join me for this whole thing stick around to the end because I do have some troubleshooting tips for you for anybody who is having problems with sticking to the molds and not coming out properly or having problems with them the sugar citric acid melting I do cover how to fix those and why those are probably happening alright so do stay to the end thanks for joining me let's jump right into those ingredients what we need and let me show you how these puppies are made all right so you ready for this so the ingredients we're going to need is one cup of a flattened pop and many many pop we'll do a yes I'm Canadian we say pop American I know soda whatever yeah I watch a ton of the competition baking shows of chocolate shows in Canada and they all use gelatin sheets and I'm like Oh Pesce said these gelatin sheets if the pros use it it must be good so what I found out is where I live they're very hard to come by I was actually only able to find them in to store the Russians store in an Italian the store and but in on on Amazon for the state you guys can get any type of gelatin sheets there are now these come in different grades it's bronze silver gold platinum and each of those are different strengths bronze is really weak silver is what they mainly use for mooses and and those wobbly things I don't know I can't think of it right now they use the silver which is about a 170 gel the gold or the platinum are going to be much strength stronger strength unfortunately I can't test with them so I don't know exactly how well they work I would love to be able to but they're on the unavailable we can only get silver in Canada yes so enough with the sheets so if you are going to try the gelatin sheets and the reason why this is so much better is makes your gelatin much softer so instead of having that really rubbery rubbery gelatin this is a much softer type of gummy candy if you use the sheets but you do need to use them in combination with granulated sugar but up I know that was a lot of talking on gelatin she so let's sleep just back up and start again one cup of your favorite flattened soda for gelatin sheets if you're going to use that if not one tablespoon or one package of the knocks gelatin that's for our soda side then we're going to do a coke candy syrup you're going to need a half a cup of can of sugar the link for the recipe how to make kin of sugar from tincture I will put in the description 1/2 a cup of regular sugar 1/4 cup of Canas can of syrup again link will be in the then you know where and 1/4 cup of your flat new soda as well we're going to cook that with our candy syrup so this is really going to help with giving us a more intense flavor in 1/2 a teaspoon of citric acid 2 tablespoons or 2 packages of gelatin so yes 3 altogether if you're using the granulated for gelatin sheets in 2 tablespoons of unflavored gelatin if you're going with the sheets because I am using 7up and as a lemon-lime I can add a little dash of lemon and lime flavoring to enhance that a little bit because it does get a little muddled down however you can keep that playing that is totally optional that's pretty much it for our ingredients now a little quick tip here for your soda if you want to flatten it quickly pour it into a glass take a metal spoon and you just stir it for a few minutes minutes and then just let it sit for about 10 minutes with the spoon in it it will completely flatten your pop or you just pour it out let it sit out for a couple of hours and nature will take care of its own thing so let's get into the equipment that we need and let's get these made I know it's a lot of good alright so the equipment we need is a 2 small saucepan candy thermometer digital or the regular regular candy thermometer of course your molds now a tip for your molds is to put them in the freezer before you start making this circle now or so before it helps especially if you're doing two-tone colors then it'll it'll start to solidify immediately it's you poor it is it will kind of keep your colors separate instead of them bleeding together if you're just doing one color don't worry about it a couple small strainers that's if you have bubble issues a couple of spatulas a bowl of ice water if you are doing the gelatin sheets your bottles dispensing bottles or the funnel works really good what I found is using the funnel if I'm using one color is all the bubbles come up to the top and the stuff comes out the bottom so you get a much clearer serum pour into your molds versus this all the bubbles set up here we turn it upside down all the bubbles are coming out with it so this does give you a cleaner more a cleaner pour if you are having bubble issues um small bowl for blooming your unflavored gelatin non stick cooking spray for our syrup and parchment paper and our rock and that's about everything we need I believe as you know I usually always forget something but let's jump right in let's get these may need all right very first step you want to do is to pour your soda your flat soda into a small saucepan we're going to put that on to medium-high heat and we're going to reduce it to half a cup and the reason that we're going to do that is is going to help to concentrate our flavor more all right so get that started because it takes about 15-20 minutes to reduce it to half so we'll start that off and we'll get that going and then we're also going to start blooming our gelatin now if you are using gelatin sheets you need ice water you have to have ice water in order for these to blue so you just take your gelatin sheets they're just they're kind of cool they're like quick like crystal clear if they didn't have that lines in them you never find them coke just pop them you just ride them into the water if you guys just make sure that there's all submersed and you can set that off to the side okay so for our granulated gelatin you're going to take a third of a cup of cold flat and soda and it has to be cold pouring that into our ball and you're going to sprinkle your gelatin over the top and you're going to stir that into the liquid make sure that it's all mixed in and that there are no lumps now one thing that you guys talk about is sometimes your gummies are too soft a lot depends on your gelatin not all gelatin are created equal even if you buy an ox gelatin regularly even that can be different from time to time whether it's been exposed to excessive heat or cold can affect its gelatin strength as well as how long it's been stored how well it's been stored all those types of things factored into the gelatin and how it can affect its gelling strength so as I said sometimes you got an increase or a decrease a tablespoon or half a tablespoon teaspoon depending so you just kind of work on your recipe if they're coming out way too sticky you can't get them out of the molds increase your gelatin by about a half a tablespoon should take care of that but for this recipe I mixed together now my third of a cup and 2 tablespoons I'm gonna set that aside and then I'm just gonna wait for this first or a soda to reduce down to 1/2 so allow your your pot to cook down like so to boil down like so like I said to about 1/2 a cup and then periodically on because you can't really see what 1/2 a cup is is just keep another keep a measuring cup nearby and just take it pour it in and you can see where you're at so we've only done about cooked off about 1/3 of a cup so far I've got little ways to go but it takes about 15-20 minutes to do that alright once you've got it cook down to half a cup just put it back in pot and you can either set it to the side to cool down we want this to get to warm or you can plop it into the fridge for a minute or two a couple of minutes five minutes to cool it down like I said though we still wanted a little bit warm for our gelatin sheet okay so now for our cooked candy syrup side we are going to get oh I always forget this you want to spray your soft pan that we are going to do our coke candy syrup take your cooking spray a light coating of spraying all through your pot take a paper towel and take out the extra the excess we just want to have a nice thin layer of the nonstick coating on the side and the reason we're doing that is when you mix the can of sugar THC does not like water it's okay with sugar but I don't like water so much so it tries to run away it hides up the sides of the pot if you don't put that oil on this side your ITD's gonna get stuck there this way we're going to be able to get it off easily and get it back into the syrup glitter belongs so we take our cup of sugar or half a cup of candy sugar half a teaspoon of citric acid citric acid is to prevent sugar crystallizing and a quarter cup of our can of syrup she goes in our quarter cup of flattened soda we're gonna mix those together and then we are going to turn our heat on to medium high or just about number seven is good and we just get that mixed together the liquid and sugar all combined and you're going to continue stirring this until it begins to boil all right so register and make sure to use the side of your spatula to scrape any excess sugar crystals off the side or at first here with the first time you can use a pastry brush and hot water to wash down the sides but we're not going to use this afterwards so as we stir this their sugars are melting and our staring helps assist with that but once it starts boiling you don't want to stir it because that will cause excess asportation which can cause your sugar to crystallize and what that means is the sugar will reform itself and create crystals in your gummy candies over a couple of days and you don't want that that's really picky you want a cool down my by 7up portion of it in the fridge and I'm gonna take my gelatin sheets and what you do is take them out of the ice water and squeeze off the excess water from them it's really really good and then you just plop them right into your soda pop there and just mix them in and it just disappears God it sounds really cool and that's it just leave that off to the side until we're ready to it until we need that now my syrup is beginning to boil so at this point I am NOT gonna stir it anymore but what I am gonna do is continue to scrape the sides to keep them clear of our good stuff and what you'll see here if you get a lot of icky stuff on top that's just the impurities and stuff boiling off so don't worry about that that will all boil off very very quickly just try to keep that a key part into the middle there so it just cooks off and doesn't stick to the sides of your pot let's see how it just disappears said if you start to see any of it gathering on the side you just want to very gently go on with your spatula around the sides you want to try and do very little agitation and just gently squeeze it and bring that back into the middle then you can just dip your spatula in to melt off anything there and we are going to cook our syrup to 260 degrees so I'm just gonna take a look where we're at right now oh and the ice water that you used for your syrup you can keep that handy because we're gonna use that to stop our cooking our cooking syrup process so right now that I'm about to 47 so about another minute or two once you get past to 21 it goes very quickly again just as it's been he gathers on the side pull it in we're just melted off the spatula we're now at 253 so it's gonna go pretty quick from here so I'm going to keep my thermometer in 60 take it off your heat put it into your ice water turn off your heat and let this come down to about 220 we'll just leave it in the ice water it'll come down pretty quick and I'm gonna grab my gelatin okay now that our shower temperatures come down oh yeah it's come lay down we're good we are going to first add in our 7up or our soda and our gelatin side we're going to mix that in together and if you do find that it is starting to solidify on the bottom that it's getting a little too thick on the bottom just put it back on your burner there's still enough heat should be enough heat from there to melt that if not just put it on the lowest heat so you just want to get that syrup melted we don't want to heat it up again but nice nobody stick it in the corners and we got nothing on our sides which is perfect now we will take our unflavored gelatin and you want to cut it up into smaller pieces just helps with melting quicker lock them in now that's warming up there to melt your gelatin it should hopefully not be too warm to cause it to to break so just let that sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and then we will stir it in and then you're just gonna gently stir to continue melting your gelatin now see this is what happens when you don't mix your gelatin properly in the beginning you get little little lumps here that happens if they don't melt in don't worry we're gonna strain that and then we'll get them out now the work we're basically done with our syrup so ready to cast now give it a little taste and if you find that it's lacking a little bit in its flavor and said if you're using like a 7up or sprite you can add you just want to do literally a drop you can either use this little supply a splash of real lemon or if you're using flavor oils use literally like a drop because you said you don't want to affect the natural flavor of the soda that you're using but sometimes it might get a little muddled like with the sprite or the 7up so literally that I use with just one drop just to enhance its flavor I don't want to mask it and trust me the line you do not want to use more than a drop its who uh he's very anemic keep joking now that that is mixed we're good to go I'm gonna get set up to pour oh so so if you're just doing one color you're good to go like me I always like to do the solid in the clear so well I'm gonna add a little bit I'm going to split this in half and I'm gonna add a little bit of white food colouring to half of the mixture and I'm gonna pour it with a strainer here so to catch any it to catch those lumps that didn't dissolve properly and if you want to be exact use a measuring cup but I just usually eyeball it so for the white if you're using white from the Wilton's one make sure to shake it very very well when you use it um if it sits for a little while it has a tendency to separate and yeah you don't want that to make sure to mix it really really well yeah we're just gonna add in a couple of drops I'm gonna give us a solid background a little bit more and with the white you do have to mix it really really well with the gelatin okay I'm just gonna get set up to get these casted alrighty so we're ready to get to the fun stuff now if you were using one of these funnels they don't come with the Unalaska canned they're a little hard to maneuver so what I created was an auto trigger well all I did was I removed the plastic singham sticky thing I tied not it it's a simple Slipknot elastic around the bottom slid it back through around the bottom now you have an auto an auto trigger which makes a lot easier for pouring so I just wanted to show you how this worked so I did support something that I'm just going to be clear I'm going to use it with this and the I'm gonna do teach own alright step top that huh so see what happens in the bottles like I said is the bubbles come up to the top well what you can do is get the spoon or spatula small enough and you can just kind of scoop those out I'm just gonna stick that there it's doing works better however I'm just gonna live with the bubbles right now because I don't really care that much now also with these bottles I've get larger tips I use four or five fours are good eyes are a little big they're good for a thicker syrup so well with our enough fun edge here I'm going to bring the camera because I want you to see how clear it actually comes out of the funnel alright so now it's time to take them out of the mold so gonna grab some parchment paper I don't know why I'm telling you that kind of calm pretty self-explanatory just didn't air and pop them out just like your regulars now give you some troubleshooting tips if you go to take your candies out of the mold and these stick so they're kind of like this and you can't get them off then let me show you so like that and you try and you can't get them off don't worry you can fix it pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees put your molds onto a cookie sheet and place them in the oven until they melt once they melt add them add the stick melted syrup to a small saucepan bloom a half a tablespoon to 1 tablespoon depending how sticky they are so if they're sticky they're almost want to come out but they just won't come out and then go with a half a tablespoon if they completely there just pretty much almost like tacky syrup then go with a tablespoon so if you're good at bloom excuse me so for half the tablespoon to bloom a half a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to use two tablespoons of cold liquid if you're going to use a tablespoon of gelatin you're going to go with a quarter cup of cold liquid sprinkle it on just like we do in the beginning let it bloom and then add that to your syrup recast your candies and you're good to go second problem people have is when they take the candy said if they wanted to sugar sugar coat them or lit the sugar sour mix and the it starts to melt once they take them out of the molds if that happens for a couple of reasons one is your refrigerator is very cold and it's very warm in your apartment or your house will cause that because the cold with the warm will cause moisture to happen and the sugar and citric acid are water soluble so obviously it's going to melt to resolve that issue take them out of the fridge allow them to dry for about three or four hours first and the room temperature and starting to dry try a couple of firk try a couple at first and see how they do if they don't melt go ahead and finish doing the batch however if they do mount still melt let them dry overnight and then coat them with sugar you should be fine now another reason that can cause your candies of the sugar to melt is humidity so if you live in a place like Florida and you have a lot of humidity again if you don't have an air-conditioner you want to let them dry out first probably did overnight before you apply the sugar coating again try a couple of first at first see how they do and if they don't as long as they don't melt continue on now if high humidity is an issue for you what you could add is about a quarter of a teaspoon of cornstarch to your sugar mix about an eighth of a teaspoon more than a quarter because the cornstarch will all stick to it and though the sugar will just want to add a little bit of cornstarch to your sugar sour mix that will help with humidity because it will absorb that moisture so those are a few things there that I hope will take care of your sugar bubble tea problem that pretty much is the two major problems that people have with their candies now with regards the other one is the bubbles the air bubbles so if you make the can of butter it with virgin and you use the hand blender you end up with a lot of air bubbles to get rid of that allow your syrup to solidify so throw it in the fridge loud to completely solidify in a pot and then put it on to low heat remelt it and cast it that will take care of your air bubbles that way the other is like I said with the funnel so let me show you this so these were the clear ones that I casted with the with the funnel and as you can see there's no absolutely no air bubbles in this versus the ones that I did do with the bottle let me try and get a white one no they actually settled I know you're gonna have what mom wants to really show you with air bubbles this this round usually I do but yeah so do the as I said to get rid of that use the funnel or allow them to solidify remelt it and no more bubbles for you so that's everything there I'm just gonna take these out of the mold and give you and come back to say goodbye so here check these out don't they look cool like I said ones no air bubbles sticky still bye no air bubbles alright so you're gonna let those dry for about 24 to 48 hours and they'll be good to go and I'm going to show you a little trick here so one thing are dried a lot of you probably find when you put them in packaging they still stick together if you don't use the sugar coating so I'm gonna show you a little trick here how to avoid that okay so to help with that sticky problem all right so to help with that sticky problem what you're going to need is a little bit of cornstarch clear plastic bag or plastic bag and a bowl but you're gonna take something you're gonna take a little bit of cornstarch and you're just gonna sprinkle just a little bit into the bowl you don't want to do too much then take your hand and kind of spread it around this breaks it up and take your candies and just drop them in toss them through your cornstarch I'll cover it so you'll feel they won't stick together anymore and now if you find that you have there is excess on there that you would like to get off like these actually look pretty good but sometimes a little bit more if you use too much a little bit more will get on there you just put them into your bag [Music] and that will help with your sticky sticky problems and the best things to store them in is sello bags or miler bags ziplock baggies um cause them to get moist over time sticky and I found that they cause the absolute most problems so the mylar bags or cell bags are work great so thank you so much for joining me today on this Canon soda pop gummy tutorial if you have any other questions please don't hesitate to put

[Music]", "jZYpZTfWLmA": "today's video is sponsored by raid Shadow legends in today's video we're going to see what happens if we try to freeze-dry a one pound gummy bear [Music] [Applause] since you guys are aware a 1 pound gummy bear is 11 servings I say it's like maybe 2 for me but according to this the back of our 1 pound gummy bear it should only be 11 servings but a 319 carbs 1,300 calories this is fantastic it also says it's equal to 280 standard sized gummy bears so we've got two of these 1 pound gummy bears you may have seen that these are not the biggest gummy bears in the world but we figured that this was a pretty good step up from our standard size they don't stand up real great by themselves but we want to see what happens when we freeze-dried should be kind of interesting now we don't actually know if it's gonna get all the way through a gummy bear in the past we have freeze-dried dubbing bears when we have freeze-dried gummy worms got some really cool results they puff up they turn into kind of like a crunchy cheeto that goes gelatinous it's very different but because of what Callie was just saying that we don't know if it'll make it all the way through we've got two gummy bears and we tried two different ways one of them will just be on the tray and we're gonna see what happens - I need your other one few times the other one we're going to slice up into smaller pieces so that poor gummy bear will not be all in one piece we just want to see if that's necessary to get the whole thing to freeze-dry and it might be freeze drivers aren't really designed to get through like this is almost 2 inches thick in some places so we can set our freeze dryer on a little bit higher heat and I think we can set it to go for extra time and we may just have to run it through a second time even after the first time through but we're gonna see what we can do to have the best chance of getting this gummy bear to freeze dry entirely because if it does that'd be cool and we've had like the little gummy bears have like we pulled inside so not these particular governors we did have some trouble in the past with Albanese gummy candies I believe I tried gummy worms from them and while the trolly gummy worms they puff up beautifully the albanese ones for some reason didn't I don't know if it's just because it's a different recipe exactly but I do love these they are the best I got this bag for my birthday and I'm halfway through it so I do want to throw some of these on the tray as a control as well right here we have that just like that and then this one you're just gonna slice up maybe not quite a quarter-inch but not much more than that I want to try a couple like paper-thin slices okay so see what happens of course that requires being able to slice through gummy bear before we load the freeze dryer with these colorful gummy bears though we want to tell you about something real raw dark epic and awesome oh are you referring to rage shadow

to get playing today go back to playing them are you winning I'm playing hey winning are you we're not going for a glowing red that will just burn the dummy instantly see how that does haha you didn't want the joint you always want the torch Nate you always want the torch I am corrected so now if I put this back it's just gonna burn instantly so this is not a perfect solution you could have just burned it until it was char and let it come off that way and now if I try and cut it's just gonna back that burning there that's as thin as you're gonna get I think I'm so impressed almost wow that's gonna stay right there and this is now going to go this direction okay so we've got our gummy bear sliced up we've got our mini controls and we have our giant gummy bear we're gonna run this up to the freeze dryer it may take more than one day I'm betting it will but let's see what happens all right fingers crossed hopefully in a day and a half that we'll have done something if not we'll probably just set it for another cycle and run it again may go and it's possible that like the stuff on the bottom will freeze dry and the stuff on top won't we may flip it over if we have to do another cycle to get from the other side they'd see how that works we've also had it before where they have melted in the drying process if it's a soft enough material I don't think these are because we've never had that problem with the gummy worms in the past it's some of our chocolates good so we'll see what happens fingers crossed well these are things we freeze-dried them we did I did come in and set it for a new cycle at that point I flipped over the giant gummy bear it hasn't really changed much since then this is basically what it looked like except now it has fly spots on all the protrusions yeah yeah and you know I bet it the middle of this is still not completely freeze-dried but we got much better results than I thought we would especially on the blue one that we cut into pieces these look very puffed up yep well okay and we've mentioned this in the past even this is a denser material than you get out of like patrol Ebro gummy worms so this is Albanese and Albanese are sort of a thicker recipe we think we're not sure why but they don't puff up the same but even these have puffed up the decent about now I want a cone open okay start from these small and so this is just a normal sized red gummy bear what what exactly remember how hard it was to cut through yeah full sized I'm gonna try the spine of the knife and see if it's any harder no pretty much exactly the same okay so we've made cheeto dust with gummy bears again yep that's bizarre I just revived the process let's check out the inside of the biggest rat you pick it up fate has decided for us that it's time to see the inside of the big one and look at that that looks changed all the way through sounds pretty cheeto ewwww no no I was right oh yeah this does have more chew to it so what Albanese always does there's a little really chewy gummy in the middle yeah that red one was crazy [Music] and this pink one I was pretty crunchy we didn't actually weigh it beforehand to see if it was accurately 1 pound we were just going and supposedly about what the box said what case we've lost point 1 yeah 6 maybe pounds off and it is still like there is absolutely still a weight to it it absolutely doesn't feel as fluffy as they normally are this is still a dense I am going to measure all of the blue parts together to see if more weight has been lost from the one that we cut up it feels like it that's if we can get everything to stack and balance nicely on our scale new strategy okay new strategy a bowl uh-huh we're professionals 13 points that's actually more what and we ate ears off of it dude I bet the ear off of it so all right all right okay our blue one that seems to have puffed up more to me actually has more weight to it still it's crunchy like it's not soft and cheeto we like these ones normally are where they break in little pieces it's just sort of snapping like if your finger nope I couldn't I tried to get a slice that didn't quite work broke or too much for that but we might have invented the loudest food in the universe you know how people are like movie theaters are a place where people want silence let's make the loudest treat possible popcorn and give it to them and put the ball in a dark room together we've made something louder [Music] it's pretty crunchy I'm gonna cut open this one living is our biggest piece what the inside is like and pretty grungy all the way through I'll give it this so the flavor is so much stronger we find that a lot can we do this even though it has expanded I feel like the flavor condenses without the liquid in it like before you eat it and you're like like the first thing that hits you is this is a gummy texture next it's okay sweet and then you can kind of get the aftertaste of bluegrass right first thing that hits you here is I have blue raspberry in my nose that's interesting [Music] [Music] I'm now going to be tasting artificial cherry in my mouth until I die I do regret that blue raspberry that concentrated is good cherry that concentrated is cough syrup okay so I put this gummy bear in the water to see if it would do anything and it's just kind of slowly dissolving while it floats to the top now I've got water in the microwave to get really hot I don't see what happens to it in hot water instead of cold water oh wow I'm so angry about that I think it just air is escaping fast enough that it's like bubbling and I can smell it smell the lemon so warm water way faster I'm just gonna take a piece of our giant bear and throw that in there too I'll the steam the lemon ones and then I just took a big chunk of blue and drop it in and it was all the way gummy bear teeth [Music] what did you have today alright gummybear team now the deal [Music] how cool is anyone not as flavorful as kool-aid here's the weird part guys this is super bizarre that is delicious and I'm really upset about it all right guys we have freeze-dried yet another very odd thing what else do you want to see because you know that freeze dryer is gonna be around for a while let's go in the comments below thanks again to our sponsor rage shadow legends click the link in the description to get playing today guys that's not all you know we've always got more for you see hit that box up the top to check out the most recent video and we will see you in the next one talk to you then [Music]", "6BxcporGcC4": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] did i ever tell you about my main man justin me and justin used to do hoodlum stuff together justin used to make violent stick figure animations and post them on the internet justin also had a band he called the band mentally justin is now marine there's a lot of things that make up a person many different elements that come together to make the delicious core of who they are gummy bears are no different you can't just do one gummy bear flavor and expect to be the bee's knees you gotta do multiple you gotta do this you gotta do that you gotta do the other and you have to do it all with military precision today the albanese world's best gummy bears look to take the crown from haribo themselves and man it's gonna be good the only way that this game advances is by people being bold and people being brash and the only way you do that is to make a statement and man did all bananas ever make i love the arrogance dude i love the arrogance of the soul you're gonna have a hell of a pair of peach pits and a couple of large dangling mango seeds clacking together to make a call out like this the world's best hell yeah dude from a flavor perspective it appears the albany's gummy bears have already won with 12 flavors of theirs and only five from the hairy bow now okay you could say oh but you could do five flavors really well and twelve really badly you could but what this shows is a creativity and a moxie to really go out there and break the status quo dude i want it to be better show me how much better it can be i mean who wouldn't want a better version of the harry well i know i certainly do let's find out just how good it is and crack this bad boy in half hold the phone hold the phone before we even get into the actual chewing aspect of it bro already albanese is winning with the resealable package right there look at that i could just seal this puppy right back up and with the hairy bow i don't get that i do not get that same sort of a distinction that convenience that i like okay albanese you're getting the point for that that's nice we've got the haribo gummy bears on the left and the albany's ones on the right and you can already tell the size difference is is monumental i mean come on now hold the phone for a second there's no doubt about it the albany's packs a lot more gummy into their bears homeboys obese talking about major thyroid problems and all that of the smell though that's where really the difference comes in because you can smell a lot more fruit flavor coming off the albany's bears as opposed to the hairy bose ones where there seems to be a bit more of a i don't want to say a plastic taste but it's a lot more muted and subdued whereas the albany's ones are a lot more explosive and more in your face it's very pleasant but it goes even deeper than that with the textures themselves also being wildly different the albanese is a lot squishier a lot more gummier a lot more malleable that kind of thing i'm decapitating homeboy here i apologize with the hairy bow being a lot firmer and a lot harder as well now whether that results in a chewier chew or anything like that i think it's gonna result with the albanese right here being a lot more chewier but we'll see if that's a good thing but before we go ahead and have a taste i have to give a big uh thank you to today's sponsor this long-nosed dog be the person he wants you to be [Music] which well i guess would just be somebody who feeds him or something i don't i don't know but let's go and go and have a taste oh please i can hardly bear it my dude this is a very close match because they're both doing their own distinctive things the same albeit a bit differently the flavor of the albanese is way fruitier i mean like you can taste every inch of that fruit every piece of juice everything that's coming off that thing you get the full experience right then and there but the hairy bow themselves while they aren't as fruity they're also not as sweet which is where the albanese kind of has a little bit of a borderline problem because it's almost too sweet it's almost on the borderline where it's like you eat more than five or six of these things and you feel like you're sick to your stomach or something like that you know it's going in between that line but it doesn't quite hit it whereas the hairy bow you can eat as many as you want these things never get tired but the question is are these better are they better than the gold standard well yes you know what i'm going to go ahead and say yes now not because the flavor is so much better than theirs but really it's because of the amount of flavors see i can have a bunch of haribo bears and get something consistent and delicious every single time but the spice of life is variety and the fact of the matter is these are on the same level as harrybo but there's way more flavors to go around making them i guess by process of elimination they really are the world's best but i mean it's so close i know it can be a bit confusing like how justin's mom would let me hang out with them anymore because she said i was a bad influence whatever that means anyway tune in next time for my next review the anarchist cookbook [Music]", "PvcL5TtojjA": "how much vodka did you put in that don't don't tell us I don't want to know I want to know how much bother did you put in that

contrack ajiz 150 milligrams of THC 10 milligrams each piece and there is 15 pieces in here so 15 doses and this actually has directions on the bag most of them normally don't but it says start with one dose which is 10 milligrams I love worth up to 90 minutes for effects and consumers needed suggested use temporarily reduces pain stimulates appetite sleep aid and relief of nausea okay so again baked pros gummy bears 10 milligrams each you know guys you know I'm a lightweight so I'm just gonna start with wine right I'm going to cut into this right now I need to cut it again because evidently I didn't cut below the seal this cut low enough that I'm not cutting all right to hit me and just because I'm going for I get it so honey bear squishy yeah Oh something got put the sugar around it because he's very cannabis II and you know I tend to stray away from edibles that have a strong lead taste because I just don't like the V taste that's a personal thing you might I'm glad I read this it says testing accuracy plus or minus three milligrams of THC per piece oh and that's the thing would be good you kind of always don't know exactly how much teach so you're getting and that's why it's best you're like you know trouble I'm and then wait a little bit before you try nothing but they're gummy bears and they're good it's like to me once you get past that initial taste of it like the cannabis taste hmm I guess the sweetness other kind of mellows that out a little bit to me and they're good they taste like gummies you know like gummy bears but growing up and coming beers right and these are things that these especially when you start talking on gummy treats and things like that candy that kids normally eat or that they gravitate towards if you're medicating that way please you know make sure that you're keeping those out of the reach I mean seriously because for them all they see is gummy bear they don't really understand any of this other stuff okay so now that I'm done this is going back into my weed safe and again yes I can have a week I do have a weed safe and I try to keep my things away I have four kids to a grown and then the two youngest or in their team so just because sometimes it's candy and it might look you know killing even though they're old enough to understand what it is I still keep it you know am i safe just you know to keep it away from him but faith grows very good and as far as um I mean there's 15 in here so I mean this is a good amount to dose with okay and when I bought this actually bought this Micra so it's been a while but the price says $31 again baked bros and so many other companies out there they always they're always offering you know not always but sometimes they're specials that you can catch at your dispensary and there are places like weed Maps who else but I go to online they will actually send me notices about different specials that dispensaries are having and a lot of the companies offer you know boku you know buy one get one so what might be you know $31 you may end up getting tuning and that's actually what I did I think for sure I didn't pay the full price for this I end up getting something free or it was on discount or something so like I always tell you be mindful about the specials and deals that your dispensaries have because you can I'm getting your medicine or action alright alright guys that is it so also available in 75 milligrams and 300 milligram bags so you have options okay alright I will talk to you guys later alright y'all take care [Music]", "ZsaaaUPTdnU": "sorry

of it taste it mmm I'm just gonna be so mad enough yeah I went down shots ready right away ready no wait let me get to the position it's not gonna work this time ready ready yeah Micah twirl I think bad just happened Jilla decided to go and take her little gummy slime and throw it on the roof so I had to jump on top of a chair jail had to jump I got my chair I had to put Jayla onto the roof so she could grab this slime thankfully we only have like I don't know ten-foot roofs at the lowest part so she's okay she's alive I'm alive we're all alive guys hi it could go H and I try to catch it but I didn't know where it went what do you think the gutter is it's in the roof girl yeah but the gutter and the roof are two separate things yeah that's true I find for you in smart well we are making our final slide it's gonna be the green slime are you ready Jay yeah over here I'm gonna put a disclaimer out there for everybody who wants to try doing this this stuff really sticks well the countertops and it really sticks fall to the floor see that we were gonna show you the final slime but you said I think we're gonna move on to cleaning up and doing all that good stuff so we'll see you guys soon look at this mess you see it you see it and now you're done Wow just like that the house is clean what do you think Enzo my pants are clean now and so are you happy about this huh these oh yeah okay about this yeah we have to put you guys in your beds you know why you would have eaten all the gummi bears all right well it's time for them to see the end results of the gummies here they are guys this one had too much cornstarch on it that's why it looks like you know all nasty still tastes good though this one's pretty good but it is firm like a rock cuz once they cool down they return to their gummy form and even a little bit harder because of the cornstarch this one's still a little bit warm I would say this is probably the best gummy that we made yeah tears here guys just suck on this one the one that got on the roof and you wouldn't want to eat it cuz it has little bits of shingle inside of it so nobody's gonna eat that one this one right here I got nothing to say about it okay that is it for today's show guys I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed making this for you guys remember that we post a lot of videos for you guys to enjoy and for us to enjoy as well so make sure you're subscribed to the channel you have your notification bell turned on if you want to be notified I mean I don't know I mean I would want to be notified of of all this goodness happen announcement about a TV wouldn't you yeah remember to do one thing eat your pickles kids bye see you guys in the next one [Music] [Music]", "dsxcqshvH34": "hey guys welcome back for another video so if you saw my video from last week we learned how to make elderberry syrup which is high in antioxidants great immune boosting properties and just overall really great health benefits so this week we're going to be doing a recipe using that elderberry syrup and we're going to be making some immune boosting elderberry gummy bears for the kids take your one cup of elderberry syrup put it in your pot and turn it on medium heat once that starts to warm and you can feel the temperature change in the liquid you can go ahead and actually turn this off you don't want it to come to a rolling boil it's going to take that much longer for them to set up [Music] because it's only one cup of liquid it usually heats up pretty quickly so there's a couple variations that you can do for this recipe so you can just use your elderberry syrup that you made last week and add your gelatin in and put it in your mold and that's totally fine for me personally i like to add the gelatin a few drops of my young living thieves because this really has a lot of health benefits to it as well and an eighth of a cup of honey just to make them a little extra sweet so again i'll have both variations written over on the blog so you can decide which ones you want to make so now that your elderberry syrup is simmering you can either add your essential oils if you're going to use some if not that's fine too then you're going to take a quarter cup of beef gelatin now this is grass-fed organic unflavored beef gelatin if you're vegan you can also use a vegan gelatin and that will work just as well so you're going to slowly add that to your pan and just continue to stir so after your mixture started to thicken up a little bit at this point you could add your eighth of a cup of raw honey you'll want to stir that up until your honey is completely dissolved if you're adding honey so now that all the liquid is blended together it's time to add the liquid into our gummy bear molds so these particular molds i purchased on amazon they came in a set of two and they also came with this dropper now you don't need a dropper to fill your gummy bear molds but i did find that it made the process a lot faster a lot cleaner and a lot easier if you don't have one of these you can use an old like medicine dropper from a kid's prescription or a kids medication that you purchased over the counter droppers are just really handy to get these molds filled so if the molds you have at home you find you're having issues getting your gummy bears out of you can take a ghee cooking spray or a coconut spray and you can spray in the molds and that should make it a lot easier to pop them out these particular ones i've never had issues getting them out they always come out really clean so now you're just gonna take your liquid and you're gonna start filling up your mold so another good thing to do if you're intending on putting these directly into the refrigerator is to do this on top of a cookie sheet you don't want to have this really warm liquid in your gummy bear mold and trying to pick this up to put it in your fridge that could also get really messy so putting it on a cookie sheet will help luckily these set up really quickly so just having them out on your counter for about five to ten minutes after you put all the liquid in your mold will help set it up before you put it in your fridge so once you remove your mold from the refrigerator this one has been sitting for about 30 minutes it's time to pop out the gummy bears i like to store mine in mason jars with lids and just keep them in the refrigerator and then in the mornings my kids usually remind me to get out their elderberry gummies so i have elderberry gummies here and then i've also made a batch of ningxia gummy bears and my kids love them both so these pop out super easy do so again check the description box down below i will have a list of all the things that i used here today and where you can find them as well as substitutions for the beef gelatin if you want a recipe card you can head over to the blog and print that out i will also have a couple different variations for this recipe over there that you can have as well i hope you guys have a wonderful weekend and i'll see you next time", "kD_h26O8fJA": "hey guys who loves purple gold beers me this one has juiciness like a strawberry i like the yellow

I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

(upbeat music)", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't

food you", "ZOEwJRlZG7s": "g'day welcome to the simple cooking Channel today I'm going to show you how to make homemade gummy bears before we get started you're gonna need some sort of mold like see what I've got now you can get this from an arts and crafts store basically this has got a little little bears in it now they're not easy to find so I will put a link to the place that I bought this from and and this cost me I think it was two dollars for one sheet now with a small saucepan just have it on the bench or somewhere put in 1/3 of a cup of water then add one satchel and these satchels vary the satchel I use has about 10 grams which i think is probably just a bit under a quarter of an ounce just slowly sprinkling there now this needs to be unflavored gelatin then you get your flavored gelatin and you want to use roughly 85 grams which is around 3 ounces now for this particular one I've chosen a strawberries and cream gelatin just pour it in slowly now once you've done this just leave this on the counter for roughly 10 minutes and it's about ready to put on the stove now put this on the stove we turn on to medium heat now we'll have this on here for roughly somewhere between 3 and 5 minutes and what we're gonna do is just give it a stir every now and then the idea is once this is dissolved it's ready okay that's ready to go let's do the next stage now just pour it into something that you can pour it out if it's got a little spent and just pull it into each mold leave that on the counter for I don't know five minutes a and then once it's just cooled a little bit and not for us to be able to transport it without it spilling anyway put the end of the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes well they're ready to go now what I like to do is I like to get a teaspoon of plain flour and teaspoon of castor sugar and just mix it together in a little shot glass like this once this has come out of the fridge just sprinkle it sort of over it this will just help the the gummies not to stick together so just do that again spread across it like that so make sure that you do wipe the excess off this because you know what spilling all over the place um well I hope you like my homemade gummy bears got so many yeah let's give them a go oh oh come come Frogger TV hmm I'll see you next time for my next meal [Music]", "AgJ_1UQlC3U": "[Music] my name is Liz this is the first time you're joining if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm going to be doing a sugar-free can of butter gummy candy recipe that's mouthful uh and so for all those people who diabetic or don't like sugar or on a healthier on a healthier version this is a healthier version of a gummy bear for you so I don't really have much more to say all the instructions and everything or coming forward so what about further ado we'll just get started okay so what we're going to need for our sugar-free cannabutter gummy candies is three tablespoons or three envelopes of unflavored gelatin one box of sugar-free jell-o for our liquids you can either just use real lemon juice you could use these flavored waters that have no sugar or any juice that has no sugar at it and you can just use water and for additional sweetness we can add in some honey or you're gonna need a half a teaspoon of gorga a half a teaspoon of citric acid a quarter to a third of a cup of canned butter melted can of butter and if you want additional colors or flavors you can add those in as well you can use the the oil base or the gel based flavors the equipment that you're going to need obviously your mold whatever molds you want to use a double boiler if you don't have a double boiler any pot small pot and metal bowl that fits you know you don't want it to touch the bottom so you want it to have enough room and that you can do a makeshift double boiler you're gonna need a bowl for blooming your gelatin something to disperse your syrup so you can knead these bottles are great because they've got these tips these piping tips on them which makes it really nice for dispersing however any squeeze bottle or dropper will work measuring spoon a lips a hand blender if you don't have a hand blender a whisk and a very strong forearm and that's about everything obviously spatula and I think that's everything that we need to get started so we'll put all the ingredients together and go over the measurements so the first things that we need to do is we're going to turn our heat on to the lowest we just want to get the water hot once it's hot you can turn it off and next we are going to bloom our gelatin so you're going to need 1/2 a cup of your liquid and three tablespoons of your gelatin you want to evenly sprinkle it over the top and then you want to make sure to stir it in then stir it up so that there's no lumps and then you're going to set that aside for five minutes to let it bloom next you're going to take a quarter cup of your liquid and you're going to microwave it for a minute or minute and 20 seconds until boiling your going to add your sugar free jello to your double boiler and you're going to add that quarter cup of boiled liquid in and you're going to stir it up until your gelatin or - your jello is dissolved and while that's melting if you want to this is when you can you would add in two tablespoons of honey if you want to add some additional sweetness to it now if you don't like the taste of honey I'm gonna say don't do it because you are gonna have that bitter taste of honey pour it in it and you also want to add in a half a teaspoon of citric acid try not to get it on your spoon like I just did you actually want it in the pot and you'll just continue to stir that gently until everything is dissolved now that everything is dissolved we can add in our unflavored gelatin so what I like to do is time to split it up in the bowl like this so it's all in pieces and it it'll dissolve quicker and you're just going to stir that in until that is completely melted now this should be warm enough to melt the gelatin but if you find that it isn't melting you can put it back on the heat for a few minutes so I had to add mine back on the heat there because it wasn't melt melting it was actually starting to solidify so I'm just got that back on the heat so that it's melting now if you've got a bunch of jell-o and gelatin stuff stuck around the sides and you can't get it off but you can just use is hot hot water and a brush then you can just easily then wash it off wash it down into the pot now that everything is melted and all dissolved now we can add in our canna butter and our Garg um so just dump in your butter your can of butter actually add in 1/2 a teaspoon of Garga now if you have one of these little strainers it's great because you can use it makes it eat nice to just evenly distribute across the top if not just try and make sure you kind of sprinkle evenly across the top of it and once all that's on you're gonna let it sit for a minute and then we're gonna get our trusty little hand blender or our whisk and now we'll get our trusty hand blender and start blending [Applause] [Music] once you're fully mixed you just want to let stir it gently so we can start to work out some of those air bubbles and we're just gonna let it sit for a couple of minutes now at this point once everything's done and incorporated if you want to add in any additional flavor or color this is when you can do it so I'm just gonna add in a little bit more red to up that red a bit and I get this no taste red because I hate the test a taste of red food coloring and Wilton's makes this no taste red which is great the only problem is is it doesn't really give you the same intensity red as the regular red does but I'd rather forsake a little bit of the color for the taste because I really don't like that kind of bitter taste that red has and next I you can use ready to pour into your bottle or you can just use your eyedropper to distribute it into your molds and we're just gonna do that next and now you just distribute into the molds and the things you don't want to fill up the mold all the way you want to just leave it a little bit of the a little bit of the edge there otherwise it creates a sharp edge on your candies so and and it tends to dry out so it's not very it doesn't make it very nice so you want to keep it just below the below the top and once you fill up your molds you're gonna put it into the fridge for 20 to 40 minutes or until they're set another thing you want to try to pour right into the center of the mold and let it distribute it I know some of them you can't they have to be little feet or legs or tails but if you can otherwise the reason is again it's not it causes it won't stick to the sides and cause that edge and if you've made these before and have done it to the top you have that kind of sharp rigid edge that always dries out and it just doesn't make your candy very pleasant that's the reason all right so I'm gonna put these into the fridge to set by the feel of it it feels pretty like it's already starting to set so probably 20 minutes is all they're gonna need now if you want your candies to have a go back to the clear more clear looking what you can do is just put it on to the heat on low heat for a few minutes and the air bubbles and that will work out and it'll go back to that clear that clear look all right so they've been studying for 20 minutes they're ready to come out now so what you want to do is lay some parchment paper down on a wire rack what I like to do is I like to poke holes into my parchment paper so that way I can get air coming up through the bottom as well just hit this with driving don't have to is just something that I do and you're just gonna stand your little gummies up if you can some will stand some won't that's it you're gonna just leave them out to dry for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours there's your gummies your sugar-free gummies see there's one that we let's that I let sit on the heat for a little while let the air bubbles come out of it and that's it there you go sugarfree gummy bears cannabutter sugarfree gummy bears gotta make that clear all right let's get one of these little bad boys a try so just like a regular gummy bear or gummy candy no difference there okay all right tastes really good so it's really going to be dependent your taste be a big factor on the liquid that you use so you definitely want to use something that does have a lot of flavor or definitely your favorite juice no sugar added juice probably those nectars are good again if you're diabetic I'm not sure about that sugar contact I know there's not extra sugar added but I don't know how much regular sugar like natural sugars are in there if that's good or not but that may be an option as well if you do though use a nectar or any kind of real fruit juice I would recommend using mold inhibitor lorraine's makes a mold inhibitor that you can order online you may be able to get it in your specialty store and if you're using any type of real juice or real fruits in your gummies all right so that's about all as well I hope you enjoyed it if this is the first time you're watching I do hope you subscribes ORS many more videos in my library there and many more to come in the future

[Music]", "qVwUhPEchho": "[Music] it's Thomas from frolic and I figured it's time for me to sit down with you and discuss a crisis that's going on we're in a lemon-peel crisis okay stores crack seed stores Long's Walmart anywhere you can find kind of crack seed they've been selling out of lemon peel and this is like the first time it's happened in forever but I feel like in the last six months eight months or so people have been going crazy for lemon peel gummies and so you know the origin of it is is a little muddy I heard it it comes from Hilo I also heard that it was probably started here on Oahu but whatever it is people are hooked on it like crack so we're gonna rank this it's a blind tasting I don't know any of the brands are that are here I've never seen the packages yet but we're gonna go through them and try some lemon peel gummies and see just one it's kind of light on the lemon peel but Asian off there where you can get the flavor of it lemon peel gummy beat there's a blue one but I want to try the red one oh so this one I've noticed the texture of the lemon peel is much finer so it's not as clumpy as the first first one mmm it's a totally different gummy it's very sweet compared to the first one that's especially on the level of the gum in the gummy I feel like the lemon peel doesn't come as through as strong as on the first one though lemon peel gummy sea hmm right off the bat it's very light on them in peel like almost non-existent I cannot taste it lemon peel gummy D Oh diva has a face this one is kind of light on the lemon peel - it's almost like a dusting mmm I don't know if I like that one I got cracker cuz we gotta cleanse the palate between gummy bears so I like the cracker where you got the cracker from okay lemon peel gummy e this one oh she is sticky okay this one this one is sticky so we know this one is a wet lemon peel Oh actually I got a double berry I got I got twins here so let's try the twins mm-hmm okay light it's light on the lemon peel favorite flavor but the sticky texture hmm okay I gotta know I get more of the lemon peel taste down this one's almost sour I think it could be the bears that are different but it's the the flavor of the bear kind of works with the lemon peel and it's this one's pretty good lemon peel gummy so this one what Oh what's a different one okay so I'm liking the coverage of the lemon peel on this like completely coats the bear the bear is much is actually smaller too I'm liking the taste of this one the best actually it's very it's very balanced compared to the others go let me lemon peel gummy bear G so last one in our taste test this one tastes like it's been marinating in the min peel for a long time it definitely has that the flavor runs throughout and the chunks are big on this one like I don't know the other ones not so much but like this one you can like definitely see that there's big pieces of lemon peel so if you like lemon peel this might be your one I think I think I think I know which how I'm gonna rank my first on my favorite one that I tasted is gonna be this one this is e F F okay let's see who made this one Oh son sunchang grocery where's that Kaneohe Oh China Town oh oh that's where you get the lemon peel from so that's why I probably tastes the best okay my second one was probably this last one that I tasted this one Oh Lonnie's Lani's okay this is this one was a special delivery - this one's from Hilo and apparently that's where Gump lemon peel gummies are from so if you know somebody in Hilo you know they can pick up Lonnie's for you and send them back but probably got to pay double okay the third one I liked was this one cuz a texture the texture was sticky and I think they use wet lemon peels so who is this one Oh family grocery Oh where's this one oh okay one windward side bear oh that's good okay that's different I like I said it didn't taste that one before most surprising because the ones I normally prefer are the dry but it was pretty good for a wet lemon peel and you know probably got to eat that one with toothpick or chopsticks because though the other ones are dry but that one is gonna stick to your fingers so gotta watch out yeah that's that's my top three [Music] you [Music]", "HPimeP9aCrg": "okay guys this one is super wild mojito gummy bears and I know many of you going wait a minute Skye can you do that hey

I'm gonna show you how to make sour\ngummy candy this stuff tastes better than the one get store and it's really easy to make you just need a few ingredients.  for the\nwet ingredients one cup of apple juice and one half cup of corn syrup for the dry ingredients you need a six-ounce pack of Jell-O or 2 three ounce packs.  today I'm trying it with strawberry and you need a matching pack of Kool-Aid.  ideally you should have the same flavor. you can mix and match but until you get the hang of this I would stick with the same flavors Jell-O/Kool-Aid combinations that work: Grape/Grape Lime/Lemon-Lime Cherry/Cherry Watermelon/Fruit-Punch you need four envelopes of gelatin.  if you\nstart making this regular which you might it's going to be cheaper if you get the twelve packs and you need some citric acid (1 tablespoon or 15ml) this you can buy at any pharmacy or\nchemist depending on what part of the world\nyou're in and but they might have to order it for you but it's usually takes a day or so it's\ndefinitely worth the wait. so what you're going to do is turn the heat on to medium, about. that's not going to burn the pot, don't worry about it the liquid is going to be in pretty quick. you get one cup of clear unsweetened apple juice. if it's a little short or over, it doesn't matter then get 1/2 cup of golden corn server and measure that pour that in now for this recipe you should have a silicon spatula it just makes life just so much easier for\nall of it give that a brief stir and just let that come to a full boil over medium heat while the liquids are heating up, I'm going to prepare the dry ingredients start with the Jell-O, cut the pack open get that in a bowl with a tablespoon next the Kool-Aid. there's no particular way to mix this up so it doesn't matter how you do it then the gelatin. I like using scissors for this saves a little bit of time. cut the tops off, pop that all in there now the citric acid you got to be really\ncareful with this okay you definitely don't want to put too\nmuch though like any dish you can adjust it for taste so that's all the dry stuff in what you're going to do is carefully mix this up, picking up the powder from the bottom until it looks \nbasically even the liquid hasn't come to a boil yet what I'm going to do is prepare the pan in the meantime for the pan I use tin foil cake pans\naround 7-8 inches something like, and I get some plastic wrap so what do you do you tear off enough of a long piece so that you will have some overlap and make sure you do this away\nfrom the stove heat okay you definitely don't want this near an open flame, it will melt pretty quick press the plastic wrap into the pan like that so on either of the short sides nearly up and that you've got a really good overlap on\nthe far sides take that away for a bit it's nearly reached a boil at this point if you're going to be\nwatching it constantly, yes it is safe to turn the heat right up now what's important is that you do not\nsplash liquid up the side of the pan because if you do it will stick and it\nwill burn which is what you don't want alright.  so what I'm going to do is carefully nudge the heat up here okay so this is the stage of boil you're\nlooking for you'll notice on the far side of the pan a \nlittle bit did splash up and burn but as long as I don't pour the candy out through that, it should be okay if you want to test it what you do is gently move the spatula through the bottom of the pan and it comes to a full boil.  that's what\nI'm looking for turn the heat off put that to the side. get your dry ingredients ready and basically just pour them right in like that. set that to the side and now turn the heat back on right down to low heat though the purpose is this is to keep just enough heat going under this\nthat the gelatin dissolves completely before I put it in the pan it's been two or three minutes at low heat and what I've been doing is I have been\nscraping down the sides avoiding the burned patch to get the mixture back down into the main mass of ingredient here. it's very important\nthat you stir gently because even with that you can see that there are air bubbles that have been put into the gelatin and you\nreally don't want that it'll clear up when it settles but you still may have some on the top okay for this part I do get a glove because the pan has become pretty hot. and I'm going to pour very very slowly and if you'll notice the burnt piece is\nnot in here there you go now for those of you that don't like those\nbubbles on the top I'll show you quick how to do this like I said all you're going to do is lose\ncandy and once it's cold no one is really going to notice and no one is going to fault you for having an air bubble in things that taste this good, and if they do well just don't give them any, alright. there you go. pick that off, scrape it into a bowl and go again and if there's some that just won't quit you can just nudge them off into a corner I'm going to let this set on the counter top basically until it doesn't jiggle see that, there is way too much motion and\nwhen it's nearly set, I'll pop it in the fridge for a few hours and I'll show you how to cut it. so the gummies have been in the fridge for a couple of hours that's what it looks like now. this should come out quite easily. you just grab it on both sides there pull it right out of the pan, put the pan on the side that's clean. you can give it a quick wipe if you want and definitely use that again. before you turn it over you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is not stuck in too bad it looks pretty good so it's going to take it quick, turn it over, then giving it a tug from the sides you want to make sure it's all clean that edge is up, that's good see what I'm doing there, hold it flat that came off all in one piece what you're going to do is start cutting. make sure your hands are clean it's still a bit sticky. you're going to cut it in pieces like that. you can either use a small knife like I've got if you want to get fancy and do worms and stuff, you can do that actually I think I will get a larger knife, it's a lot easier and I'll show you, just a minute if you get a nice French knife and after you cut one strip off what you do is get there kind of rock it through what you want to do is pull off strips like this once you've got your strip pulled off, I would do them all in strips like that first so once you've got enough room, then you want to start cutting them up like that in little squares that's what I have that bowl there for see on the other side there you might have a few air bubbles and who\ncares. I think those are pretty good treat size I'm going to finish chopping these up there is today's recipe, sour gummy\ncandy I really hope you guys try this out,  it's\njust awesome, it really really is look at the color of that and if you wanted, you could if you\nwanted get a cookie cutter or something and maybe do little shapes or stars or whatever\nyou felt like if you could get a small enough cookie cutter for this.  personally once people have tasted these things, they won't really care what they look like so once again thank you for watching my\nstuff and I'll see again", "mAZXWAuWp6E": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make nerd ropes here's what you're going to need two boxes of nerds one cup of gummy bears and some tincture the first step is to fold some foil in an accordion shape and spread it along a baking sheet then you can pour your Nerds into each fold of the tin foil make sure you have enough because if you don't the gummy make sure we'll stick to the tin foil and it'll be harder to take them out after then you'll melt you're going bears in the microwave for about 40 seconds and if you like add 1 tablespoon of ginger and stir it in I'm gonna be pouring my gummy mixture into a squeeze bottle so it'll be easier to dispense be careful not to pour too much just like I did on that first one take it slow and just do a thin line now you can top the ropes with some more nerds once they've all been filled squish the tinfoil together to make them into a tighter more compact shape then put them into the fridge or freezer I still had some remaining mixture left and instead of making more ropes I'm just gonna make some little nerd bytes by using a mold that I had on hand I also added some more nerds on top before I put them into the fridge once they've solidified in the fridge or freezer shake off the excess nerds into a bowl and then peel them off the tinfoil now some of mine came off okay but some of them I had a little more difficulty with so I decided to leave them out for about 24 hours outside of the fridge or the freezer so that they could dry out a little bit more which made them a lot easier to peel off the nerd bites in the silicone mold came out really easily after letting them sit in the freezer for about an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you guys they turned out so beautifully it did take an extra day for them to drive because they were sticking to the tinfoil but after I let them dry they turned out absolutely wonderful just make sure you put enough nerds on the bottom part of the tinfoil so that you're not having issues with the going mixture sticking I can't believe how fantastic they all came out I'm so excited and they're so delicious because I have already tried some and the little bites are so few I love them so much I could have made more ropes but I kind of liked having these little ones if you just grab I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you to the person who requested me to make this video because I'm absolutely in love with these and I'll be definitely making them again thank you guys so much for watching I hope you try these out have a wonderful day", "U3FvHNl2k58": "hey everyone i'm Shereen from mypaynecenter.com\u00a0\nthe cbd headquarters hey today i want to try our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "8YfY_NDparw": "and welcome back to my channel today I am going to be showing you how to make canna gummies I did a video on my channel on how I make that infused coconut oil so this is just pretty much a part 2 on how I make my gummies I'm going to show you what I use I had all measured out just to make it a little bit easier for you so you are going to need two packs of this jello it's 85 grams you only 2 of those you'll need 1 envelope of gelatin you will need 1/4 cup of cannabis coconut infused oil so I will link that video down below on how I made this and then you will need 1/2 a cup of water you can use juice or water I chose to use juice it just gives it more of a nicer flavor and you can't taste the weed then you are going to take your gummy bear trays which I got these on Amazon I think all for five of these were $20 so let's get started on the first step this is a very very easy recipe and anybody can do it I mean I can okay so we're going to put this on low heat and we are going to add our canna oil [Music] then our half a cup of water or juice you're gonna walk to so you're gonna want to get this to a boil I already pre turned it on so that's why it's sizzling like that so you're just gonna get it to a nice little boil and I do have this on medium heat so you don't want it to burn so just put it on medium then once it is boiled I will tell you the next step it's already hot so I should be able to add in my next ingredients which is the gelatin and the jello so again it's one cup of the gelatin and two of these 85 gram cellos I usually do not turn the burner on to warm it up so that's why it's like that this is one of the easiest recipes I have found so I am just stirring it and waiting for it to come to a boil which doesn't take long then I will start putting them in my trays so once it has just came to a boil like this you are going to turn it on probably one or two cuz you don't want it too high but you don't want it to get cold and then I have this and you're going to have to keep stirring it well you were putting it in the gummy tray if you don't the can't oil will kind of like go to the top like oil and water doesn't mix right so you just imagine if you stop mixing it like this it's not gonna work and then you are just going to put these in as you keep stirring it's kind of hard to do like both at once but you have to make sure that you keep stirring it I have not stirred it and then all of the oil goes to the top of the gummy bear and the gummy bear is just a terrible consistency it'll be gummy on the front and then the back it'll just be like pure cannabis so really it's not enjoyable for you to eat the gummies I usually get about four trays so I will just bring you a little closer and this is how the wheel gummies come out so not too hard so I'm trying to do this about hand just like this cute little cousin bears so that's how you make it it's really really easy to follow I can make it so you if you have any questions leave them down below and I will try to answer them for you", "b4tD1jFpTPo": "hello everybody and welcome back to kj steve i hope you guys are having yourselves a wonderful day enjoying ourselves all that wonderful magical good stuff and for today's episode we're doing another edible review since you guys like the sour patch one i went out and tried to find myself other edibles i think would be interesting for you guys and for today's episode we got we got the little trillium edibles edibles i don't know if you guys have seen these before if it'll focus yeah so they make all different types of making of the sour patch to make the little watermelon ones all kind of different ones but since my personal favorite candy is trolleys i went out the way and found these and yeah so from what i can tell these are 300 milligrams in each packaging thc obviously and from what i've heard this brand is really good it's really high quality hopefully it's better than the sour patch ones which i hope it is so yeah before we get into it guys please like subscribe comment all that wonderful magical good stuff and without further ado let's get into this [ __ ] so real quick just in case you guys are out here trying to get your own and all that stuff please be aware when it comes to edibles cards all sorts of [ __ ] packaging like this can easily be bought off ebay amazon off the internet and people can be you know [ __ ] with your [ __ ] but just as a little reference in order to know that these are real each little metal packaging will have like the certain color coordination on the dip part so if this trolley is going to have the blue and red if it's sour patch it's going to have the green and so and so and also where it says the thc part right there if you you guys probably see it'll focus for you there should be like a little very gray doctor symbol on the back so there's that too so yeah so let's open this [ __ ] and let's get it so it smells like you know what you would expect gummy worms to smell like but it has more of that gourmet kind of snow and you can still smell a little bit of the weed is not too crazy so you know you can have these out and it wouldn't be noticeable get these [ __ ] out this is pretty much what they look for they're nice big worms they're not like i thought they're going to be more like trolleys like the actual smaller ones but not either pretty solid big so because of that there's only there's six in each bag which isn't bad so normally for someone who has a lower tolerance i would say go for three but if you're like me someone who has a higher tolerance or just naturally prefers to be higher and likes being high i would say knock all sticks down the 300 milligrams it's a nice steady high well we'll find out soon so we like to send [ __ ] in this channel i'm gonna go ahead and eat all six we're gonna eat a little part just to do a little taste review see how it [Music] this is hit say and they do taste like what i would say gourmet gummy warmers would taste like like if you go to a dollar store or any grocery store and they normally got like you know they got the trolley brands and then they got like the market brands it tastes kind of like the market brands but of course it also has that hint of wheat on it and what i do like about these compared to the ones um compared to the sour patches i did earlier the weed taste on this is a lot more subtle than it was on the sour patch one yeah it doesn't hit you in the face like you're eating it you merely taste gummy worm not you know wait so that's a good part on edibles so does it take longer to eat or are you just going slow this is a big gummy worm the regular gummy worm colors the blue and orange green yellow and the [ __ ] red another one sorry they are solid if you do start throwing more in your mouth you are going to get a little bit more of the wee taste but of course that's because you put a lot but yeah tastes good packaging is good six in each thing it's not bad it's a nice solid high i would assume and i would hope it would take you know just an average 30 to an hour to hit and hopefully since these look good they taste good hopefully it'll be a nice long lasting high oh again guys please like subscribe all that good stuff and you guys have you know any specific edibles you guys would like to do review on any glass any cards anything specific and he's trying to weed please let me know down below and i'll try my best to get my hands on it [Applause] but yeah just finished eating this and i would assume it'll take 30 minutes to an hour so i'll check in with you guys in about an hour or so to see how these are pretty much hit me so i hope you guys enjoy eating edibles too or just smoking along i'll be back with you guys hello everybody welcome back and we are about what i would say two to four hours deep on these edibles so it took about an hour to hit you know normally able to take and they are doing their magic they're great it's a nice body and head high and you know yeah it's what i would say if you've experienced edibles before you know saying your first edible you know what a good edible high is this is a very good one i would highly recommend yourself to get a metals if you can but yeah aside from that it's a great thing if you can try to get your hands on them you can try them out i don't know if they're all the same i'm gonna try to get my hands on some sour patch ones or some different ones but until then we'll see so yeah i would rate it you know 10 out of 10. if you guys get your hands on it you should try it so yeah that'll be if you guys

To start\nyou're going to need gelatin, sugar And of course Rose a wine! I found the gummy bear mold  online for less than ten dollars And they include a dropper to\nmake it easier to fill Measure out 1 cup of Rose on low to medium\nheat.  Cook the rose' in a small saucepan and do not let it boil Next add a half cup of sugar and whisk\nit until it dissolves slowly add in the gelatin one packet at a time into the\nmixture. Four to five package should do the trick   After whisking the mixture - pour it into\nthe molds. I used the dropper for better accuracy but a spoon works too This recipe will make at least eighty to\na hundred gummy bears depending on the size of mold you use. Let it set for at\nleast two hours and when you've done pop out the gummys. They looks so cute at first you\nalmost don't want to eat them but remember keep them away from children as\nthey may retain some of the alcohol but for the adults, rose a gummy bears make\ngreat gifts for bachelorette parties or even wedding favors! So that recipe was a\nlittle too complicated for you don't go drinking that road they just yet put it down because we have an easier\nrecipe. Take some store-bought gummies and place them in a bowl. I used\ngrapefruit flavors but any kind will do. Pour the rose' over the gummies\ncover and set in the fridge for 10 hours the gummies will expand. To serve\nplace them into a jar with a lid now They're ready to eat! Again make sure to\nkeep these away from children.

wave machine with simple and inexpensive materials this I catch and demonstration is great for the classroom all you will need is duct tape bamboo skewers ring stands clamps and of course some gummy bears use ring sense to elevate the tape and keep the setup Bridget be sure the tape is quite tense next place the skewers with gummy bears at roughly even intervals across the tape get your wave machine moving with a single pulse like this we can observe the propagation moving down the Machine due to the energy we insert by pushing down on the tape the gummy bears add mass to the system and slow the motion down so it is easy to observe show your students how waves reflect at fixed ends and even simulate the change in speed of a wave as they propagate through different indices of

second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other

that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's

"zEg--EdTStY": "what's going on guys this is Vince with V Fred comm here in my kitchen and today I'm getting away from the gym I'm actually gonna show you how to get a better workout with some pre-workout gummi bears [Music] like I said today's video is going to be a little change from the normal type of video that we're doing here on the channel because I want to show you a fun little recipe that I recently did on one of our instagrams if you're not following us make sure you go follow us v shred or view shred for women for all the ladies out there but this recipe got a lot of great feedback because obviously pre workouts are amazing for taking your workout to the next level giving you energy helping your muscles helping out with circulation all these different things that help your workout get taken to the next another level well a lot of people have been taking pre workout the same way for years and maybe they're looking for something new to try out that's gonna be tasty and fun and this is the perfect opportunity for that because these are going to be gummy bears so before I get into it I will say you are going to need some gummy bear molds I got this off Amazon for like five bucks you're also gonna need a saucepan a bowl to dump it in some gelatin just the Knox packets a little measuring cup and then you're also going to need a pre-workout obviously otherwise you're just making unflavored gummy bears whether you're taking a pre-workout already or not you can use the one you're currently using if you're looking for a new pre-workout the one that I personally take every single day to take to get awesome workouts it's this one right here fruit punch pre-workout by sculp nation I'll just put a link to it down in the description below this video and I'll put a little code down there if you want to get 20% off on this video only but this is the pre-workout that I take this is the one that's going to make this taste amazing this is fruit punch we have blue raspberry there's also peach and we're coming out with new flavors but it has the perfect amount of caffeine it's got a perfect blend of amino acids it's got l-citrulline that helps with just burning more calories got beta alanine to help out with your pump betaine it's got a bunch of different things to help out with an amazing workout check it out if you want a new workout but this is what I'm going to be using for the recipe ask for the recipe itself it's going to be super simple it's going to take probably like five to ten minutes for you to make and about two minutes for me to get through it so make sure you're smashing that subscribe button before we get any further joined the V shred fam here on YouTube thank you for doing that also hit that like button below but other than that let's get into this recipe so first things first you're gonna need 1/2 cup of warm water you're gonna take that warm water you're gonna dump it into your saucepan then you're going to take one scoop of your pre-workout hopefully you're not taking one of those big pre-workouts got a bunch of filler in it with a massive scoop because it might be a little it might not mix right but one scoop of this pre-workout works perfectly then you're going to take three NOx packets of the gelatin rip them all open dump them in there mix it all up then we're gonna take that and we're gonna go put it on a burner so we're gonna turn the burner to a low heat and you basically just want it to heat up slowly and the gelatin and the pre-workout and everything is going to dissolve completely you're gonna wait till it's dissolved completely and once it is and it starts to thicken so you want to wait until it starts getting more of like a syrupy consistency once it gets there and just figure that out by taking a little spoon in there and seeing how easily it dumps off the spoon you're going to take it off the burner you're going to pour it into just a little Bowl once you have it in that little Bowl I have a little dropper that I use to get it out of the bowl and into the little mold gummy bear molds if not and you're just pouring with the bowl that's totally fine too if you want to search amazon for the ones with the dropper I highly recommend it because it makes it a lot easier but basically you're going to get it out of the bowl you're going to take the dropper fill up as many gummy bears as it takes take that mold put it into the either the refrigerator for about two to three hours until it hardens or put it into the freezer if you're trying to get this done quickly take something like 15 to 20 minutes in the freezer you're gonna pull it out you're gonna be able to squeeze them out onto a plate you're gonna have little delicious gummy bears and the cool thing about it is this is probably with these little molds I got right here it's gonna make probably 20 to 25 different gummy bears so you get to eat 20 to 25 gummy bears all before your workout because this was just one scoop of the pre-workout and one scoop of the pre-workout is obviously fine to take before a workout so make sure you're eating all of them not just eating a couple of them because you're worried that you're eating gummy bears because these are healthy when you do it exactly how I showed you in this video and again if you're looking for the pre-workout that I'm using the

I'm Sofia and today I'm going to\nshow you how to make some edible slime. So I know slime is not normally edible, it's\nusually made out of, like, glue and stuff that you can't eat, but today, since\nwe're in a bakery, it's gonna be done edible! So first I'm gonna take like a\nhandful or two handfuls of gummy bears. I'm gonna put these in the microwave for\nabout 30-45 seconds and then we'll be back. So now that they are done in the\nmicrowave, I'm gonna mix it and you want to work a little bit quick just so it\ndoesn't harden and it you have to reheat it. It's turning into more of a liquified gummy bear. Be careful, it may be hot. I'm gonna add some cornstarch just so\ncould help the slime form. So you could mix it with a spoon or your hand. I\nprefer my hand because it could help mix. You're gonna want to add about three\nspoons total of cornstarch and you want to just mix it in so it would form. Be\ncareful, it still maybe hot. Okay, almost there. Again it's gonna get all over your\nhands. I'm gonna add my final scoop of cornstarch so now I have three scoops of\ncornstarch. Since this came out, like, a really ugly color I'm gonna add some\nblue. And you could always add edible glitter -\noh this is gonna get all over my hand! My gosh okay so once you get it you could\nlike kind of play with it and since it is edible you could even eat it! Tastes\njust like gummy bears! This may give you an arm workout, too, but\nit's okay because it's fun! It's like I'm pulling taffy! It feels like slime on my hands, it's\njust instead of slime that comes off your hands, it's the slime that stays on\nyour hands like for a really long time! Thank you guys so much for watching!
