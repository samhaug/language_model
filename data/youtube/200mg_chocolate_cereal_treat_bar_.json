{"tQvZcmtJXUg": "look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar recently i've really gotten into making my own edibles from concentrates i've gotten from the dispensary you guys have been asking me to make youtube videos about some of the recipes i've made so today i'm going to show you the easiest one i've learned so far today we're going to be making medicated chocolate bars it's extremely simple and that's why i wanted to show you this method first all you're going to need is a chocolate of your choice mct oil or coconut oil and either distillate or rso today i'm going to be using distillate but both will work the same for this recipe you can use any form of extract as long as it's been decarb some equipment you'll need is a heat safe bowl a pot a rubber spatula a pyrex measuring cup some measuring utensils a plastic syringe you can find these in most pharmacies and then you'll need a mold for the chocolates if you don't want to do bars you can do molds that look like anything you want there's stars there's bears you can really get creative now the amount of chocolate you use depends on how potent you want your chocolate bars to be the more chocolate you use the less potent your edible will be today i'm using a granite distillate that has about 830 milligrams of thc in it and i'm going to be making two chocolate bars so each chocolate bar is going to have about 400 milligrams of thc i'll explain how to calculate how potent your edibles are a little bit later on in the video but for now let's get started making our edibles first thing to do is fill your pyrex measuring cup with water and put it in the microwave for about two minutes after that two minutes is done take out your now hot water and drop your syringe of distillate in that water this is to make the distillate more of a liquidy consistency so it's easier to mix in with the chocolate you do not want to skip this step distillate is very thick if it's just been sitting in room temperature but now we're going to set up our double boiler by getting a pot with a little bit of water not too much you don't want the water to be above where the bottom of the bowl is going to be sitting on top of it bring that pot to a boil then turn it to low while topping it with your heat safe bowl the heat from the steam is going to be our heat source and now we're going to add just under a teaspoon of mct oil mct oil or coconut oil supposedly helps speed up the digestion process of an edible allowing you to feel the full effects quicker you let the mct oil sit for about a minute let it get nice and warm before you add your distillate and now we're going to take that distillate out of the water and pour it into the bowl just look how easy it is to squeeze out of the syringe it's going to mix perfectly now stir the distillate with the mct oil let it all get mixed together and now we're gonna add our chocolate i'm using just under two and a half ounces of milk chocolate here it melts easier if you break it up a little bit mix it while it's melting and make sure your stove is on the lowest possible temperature you do not want to burn the chocolate keep stirring until it's liquidy and now we're going to fill our syringe and transfer the chocolate into the molds you don't need the syringe but the syringe makes it a much cleaner process and since the chocolate is medicated i want to waste as little of it as possible so i feel like the syringe really helps with that this process takes a minute but the result is worth it i put a little cutting board under the mold to help them keep flat this especially helps when you're transferring them into the fridge and make sure the molds are filled completely nobody wants airy chocolate you can bag and shake the molds a little bit to help everything even out once the molds are filled you want to put them in the fridge for 30 minutes after that 30 minutes you want to transfer them to the freezer for about another hour and now it's time to enjoy got my molds fresh out of the freezer right here you guys gonna show you how good these look don't want to break it it's nice and frozen so typically they're not going to break on you oh yeah look at that you guys perfectly made 400 milligram chocolate bar bust out the second one oh yeah holy crap you guys that looks like a professional chocolate bar my plan is to cut these in half to their 200 milligram squares i feel like that's a little bit more of a realistic dose i've done this before and gotten a little bit more creative this is like a cookies and cream bar i used white chocolate and oreos since i used oreos i had to use a little bit less chocolate so i used about two ounces of chocolate to get two chocolate bars here's another one i've done where i added marshmallow and graham crackers to it so it's like a medicated s'mores bar all of these chocolate parts were made from the same strain with the same batch of distillate and the same amount so in theory each chocolate bar should have the same amount of potency and that's kind of what i was shooting for here i just wanted a bunch of different chocolate bars that i all knew were the same potency if you use two different types of distillate or rso and another one one might hit you a little bit harder than the other but since these were all made with the same amount the same strain from the same batch they should be a very consistent high and the reason why i like these little squares is i feel like it makes it easier to dose out a lower dose if a chocolate square like this has nine little chocolate squares in it and has 215 milligrams it should be somewhere between 20 to 23 milligrams per chocolate so i can either have like nine doses of 23 milligrams or an entire dose of about 200. it's super easy to find out how many milligrams of thc is in your edibles it just takes a little bit of math and a little bit of knowledge all you need to know is the amount of product you put in it and the total thc of that product if you're using a gram of distillate that has 80 thc it has 800 milligrams of thc in that gram if you're using 2 grams of distillate that has 80 thc there's 1600 milligrams in that batch so once you find the total thc in your batch just divide that number by the amount of treats you made so if you use 800 milligrams of thc in that batch and you got 20 candies each candy is going to be roughly 40 milligrams of thc this concentrate i was using had 83 percent thc in it so it has about 830 milligrams of thc in the gram personally i like to take a couple milligrams off my dose because i feel like not all of it makes it from the bowl into the edible so that's why i consider these bars 400 milligrams instead of i hope you learned something about edibles and i hope this maybe even inspired you to make your own it's super simple and all edible recipes are pretty easy if you can bake or cook you can probably make edibles and let me know if you

just not upon how to make it the first thing is how much food you want to make the second thing is how large you can find containers or vessels or cooking things like this oh my god that is a bathtub if you maybe do a little bit of math you can figure out how many cups the whole thing has divide that by a hundred and they'll tell you how many cups up each cereal your face is looking like it's a little yeah I have to do it where you take the gallons of water and you like to fill up a jug of milk with water and you pour it in until it reached the top and like work backward so it's like four quarts per gallon and then two pints for four and like four cops to my you have to do a lot of math so do you really do that every time yeah sometimes it's necessary well I was just gonna eyeball your admirers I can't wait to watch all of your just making it big where you do this but in actual professional the more better way you know there might be a special episode with you in it that would be amazing okay so I have some math to do 22 inches nine and a half inch 16 by the link but let me multiply the product of the length and width by the depth of the thousand one hundred sixty eight cubic centimeters cubic inches two cups what if I just did 100 cups I think that sounds fine so I need 16 of these in sixty six tablespoons of butter I'm going to be doing 18 times the size of a normal

supposed to grease all the side and you would be right I'm gonna have to figure out a place to put all of this in order to add it back in fly by the seat of my pants here and so Mel would grease this I'm just using pretty much a whole thing of shortening using my hands it's disgusting but it's working the most effectively she's all buttered not to put everything together I guess a teaspoon so that's a devil some time to put two bags of marshmallows in here I can't believe I'm doing this this is totally cool how am I supposed to code them oh they're melting at the bottom though it's smooth now I think we should remove it for me to mend them you think I've never made rice krispies treats before and you'd be correct I'm gonna try to put it in here it's so sticky I don't know what the ratio of marshmallow anus to cereal this should be like you can't see this very well but I don't have any more places to put boxes of cereal Larry's done it's looking pretty sick George this process

that I never spoke about what the flavor is like imagine if you are tasting every cereal you've ever thought about all within seconds of each other a cacophony of flavors one at a time peanut butter berry chocolates and pumpkin spice mixing 100 cereals together actually tastes pretty good I'm pretty sure anything could taste good as a rice krispies treat no I'll see you guys in the next video

pieces are created equal and to have some cbd handy in case you get overwhelmed do hi everyone thanks for joining me today's episode is to celebrate my 1000th subscriber actually from the time it took from the channel hitting the 1 000 subscriber mark to the time i was able to get my ingredients together for this video it had almost doubled so you guys are amazing and i'm saying thank you by sharing the best cereal bar recipe ever oh and for anyone wondering this recipe works very well in a cannabis free format simply use non-infused versions of the ingredients listed in the exact same way and make sure to label everything clearly i can't wait you guys are gonna love this as always we start by assembling our ingredients and we should use our scale where applicable three quarters of a cup or 188 grams can of butter or can of coconut oil you can check out this link to learn how to make can of coconut oil just like i do today i'm using butter that i made with tropicana glucky's trim it's got this sweet sagey smell that promises happy inflammation relief once our ingredients are assembled we melt our can of butter or a can of coconut oil in a very large pot over medium-low heat and we prep our pan i like using a large rectangular roasting pan lined with greased parchment paper the paper will make it easy to get the squares out of the pan and greasing the paper makes it really easy to remove the paper from the treats usually by the time you're done this step it's time to add the lecithin to the pot half a teaspoon and lecithin the lecithin is technically optional but i love it for the creamy texture and the shiny finish stir until smooth you also need two 400 gram bags of mini marshmallows some areas sell mini marshmallows in 454 gram bags if this is applicable to your area simply add an extra two cups of cereal and follow the video as normal stir until smooth 2 cups or 500 grams can of chocolate chunks divided into two parts of one cup or 250 grams each the chocolate i'm using today is also made with the tropicana glucky's trim follow this link and learn how to take your favorite strain and turn it into can of chocolate you also need one teaspoon vanilla and lastly a pinch of pink salt this is also optional you guessed it stir it until it's smooth i find that if i'm struggling to keep a grip on my tools all i need to do is wrap some elastics around the handle of my spatula and things get much easier you also need 12 cups of cereal your choice i'm going with puffed rice because i like the texture and i'm a sucker for the classics but you can use any kind that makes your heart happy now we're going to add in the cereal about 1 3 at a time scraping the sides in the bottom after the workout that is mixing this concoction we gently fold in the remaining can of chocolate chunks careful to spread them out but not allow them to melt completely i mean you could melt it all down but i like the little pockets of extra chocolate so what about you let me know in the comments section do you like it smooth and creamy or do you like the extra chunks now we're gonna dump this into our prepped pan with as little ceremony as possible making sure to get all of it in at once now we have two options in front of us we can squish the chocolatey goodness into a level brick it's going to be solid heavy and slightly more evenly dosed or we can take two forks and gently pull our mix until it's spread evenly around the pan this method is going to reduce dose control but the texture is light and buttery and it's much easier to eat either way spread out until satisfied and let chill for 10 to 15 minutes we then use a ridiculously long knife to cut the slab of cereal bars into 24 pieces to be packed away before i have more than i should because the cannabis might be good for me but the sugar and the calories still add up faster than i really want to think about serious though guys check out the chocolate to cereal ratio there's no pooling at the

to have more fun with them by adding different cereals on just add sugar we're bringing you some of our favorite sugary recipes that are short attempt and to light any sweet tooth so I already have some butter melting in a big pot and I'm just gonna add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows so fun I'm pretty much making this just like your standard rice krispies treats but I know I feel like Rice Krispies have all the fun and what about they're pretty pebbles and the golden grams of the world so I'm just gonna have these marshmallows melt over a medium-low heat now my personal favorite combination to make is fruity pebbles Froot Loops and Trix it's pretty much the most colorful sweet cereal you can find but I feel like it's a lot of fun combining a couple so like Reese's puffs are really really yummy with chocolate Lucky Charms so you have like the chocolate flavor but then the peanut butter from the Reese's puffs another really great combo is cinnamon toast crunch with Golden Grahams so freaking good so I think what's great about making these at home is you can literally have so much fun with all the mix-ins and it's it's a basic recipe it's just three tablespoons of butter ten ounces of marshmallows and then six cups of any cereal you want as soon as your marshmallows are melted nice and smooth you're gonna turn off the heat and add your cereal all right so I got my tricks my fruit lose my fruity pebbles pour them all in and then give it a good stir and fold the marshmallow all over the cereal you want to coat every single piece oh it smells so fruity in here and sweet and yummy mmm this looks fantastic now I'm just gonna pour it into a pan that I've already sprayed with nonstick cooking spray now whatever sticks to the spatula I just think that I should keep because I'm the one that made these anyways so I'm gonna save that for later and then a great tip for pushing all of the cereal down into the pan is just spray your hands with a little bit of nonstick cooking spray a little rub rough and then just press and be very careful this actually isn't hot anymore but it's warm I like my rice krispies treats really really thick so I'm pushing this into a brownie pan but you could actually press it into a cooking pan too or a baking sheet and what's fun about making them at home is you can cut them out any shape you want you can use different cookie cutters heart crispy treats alright so now that it's packed in there I'm just gonna let it cool before we cut them now that my marshmallows cereal treats are cut and cold you can even take them a step further by dipping them in chocolate so I actually have some melted chocolate right here and you can drizzle it or you could just dip them half away oh my gosh so this one that I made is the Reese's puffs with the chocolate Lucky Charms dipped it halfway and milk chocolate and then I'm just gonna let it harden for a second let's whistle this one with some white chocolate you can really have fun with glazes frostings anything you want really and then while the glaze is wet I'm just gonna sprinkle it with a little bit of sprinkles these are such great desserts I think people think of rice krispies treats as being a snack but if you brought these to a party let me tell you there won't be anything left these look so amazing and they're so yummy - rice krispie treats aren't just for kids thanks so much for watching let me know what your favorite combo is in the comment box below and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe I'm brandy we'll see you next time on just dead sugar [Music]", "oadxg2t9Vks": "no friends this is Heidi with Kadesh Corral today I'm making something really really fun because my grandkids are coming over and I just thought that the family would just enjoy these today when it is super hot outside and they don't wanna have the oven on I don't want to bake brownies I surely don't want to bake cookies or I don't want to bake a cake I always make these treats and these are so delicious these are my fruity pebble marshmallow treats they are made pretty much like you would make a rice krispies treat but I thought that I would share this recipe with you guys because I love making these so much so right now in my pot here I have a 1 stick of butter that I've been trying to melt for quite some time I actually turn the heat up finely and it is finally melting I love making these fruity pebble treats because I think they're so colorful and so fun and everybody really enjoys them because they are a little bit different than a regular rice krispies treat so since my butter is just about melted I'm gonna add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to this that's gonna just add a little extra flavor into this and make it taste really really good I'm gonna turn the heat down on this now I finally got it hot now I'm gonna add one bag of large marshmallows now you can do 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows I just have the large on hand so I'm just gonna use those you can use colored marshmallows those are really fun to use I bought pink marshmallows before that it makes it extra colorful put the fruity pebbles go ahead and add in all of our marshmallows because we got to get these melted them all out of the bag there we go I always have marshmallows on hand this time of year because we do a lot of bonfires and so we roast a lot of marshmallows and eat a lot of some mores so that and hotdogs are a must this time of year to have in the refrigerator so I'm just going to simply melt these marshmallows and then I'll come back and I'll show you what is next you my marshmallows are pretty melted I'm gonna add in approximately six cups of Fruity Pebbles cereal can I'm going to measure that out sometimes you will need to add just a little bit more you add their cereal and fill it all kinds of pools together and you know that will set up nicely when you put it in your pants okay that's six cups right there and now you want to act quickly you want to turn the heat off and you want to get these three pebbles covered with this marshmallow mixture as good as possible now you want to have a 9 by 13 glass pan or metal and you can either butter it or you can do as I have and I have sprayed it with Pam and I'm gonna move the camera down here so you guys can see it so now I'm just going to put all of this mixture into the pan and remember this is good and hot so be careful not to burn yourself push this down what I like to do is take a little bit of wax paper and spray it with some Pam and place it over the top and press it down that way you have a nice even consistent bar so I'm going to do now I'm gonna place my wax paper that I just sprayed and I'm just gonna press this day now you can actually put your mixture into a baking sheet and I'll make it better and then when it cools you can take cookie sheets and cookie cutter excuse me and cut out really cute shapes for the kids but I'm just doing bars because I feel like this is the easiest thing to do so once I get everything all good and pressed out I just kill this off I'm gonna let this cool completely and then we'll come back and cut these in two bars don't they already look good our fruity pebble marshmallow treats are done and ready you want to keep these in a airtight container at room temperature and they will last for about three days they will not last three days in this house they will probably be all gone by midnight tonight to be terribly honest but they are super simple they're easy they're colorful there are a lot of fun all the kids that come to my house enjoy these my children still enjoy these and they're not even kids anymore and I love them as well so I hope you guys enjoyed this very simple recipe

[Applause] [Music]", "1gH8M_OdQCA": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate rice krispie treats and this is what they look like now this is just your regular rice krispies treat that we all love only we're going to add three different types of chocolate so the first thing we need to do is to prepare our pan I'm using a 9 by 13 inch pan which is 23 by 33 centimeters and you could just spray it with one of those nonstick sprays I'm going to brush my pan with just a little bit of melted butter or you could even brush your pan with like a flavorless oil whatever way you want to do it because if you've ever made rice krispies treats you know it's very sticky so that's why you want to make sure Japan prepared well and now so um what the first thing you need to do is get a large bowl I did just spray my the inside of my bowl with with a nonstick spray again you could use a little melted butter or a flavorless oil and what I put here is six cups which is 150 grams of rice krispies cereal or some type cereal like that different brands and now what we're going to do is you'll need about a medium sized saucepan again I'm going to spray that and I'm actually even going to spray my spatula because everything's sticky here and first thing you need is five tablespoons which is 70 grams butter now here you could use salted or unsalted butter and I've just kind of cut it up a little bit so it will melt faster and I'm just going to turn my heat on to medium and I'm just going to let that mount hey Soren butter has melted and have your heat medium medium-low you don't want it too hot here and I'm just going to add two ounces which is 60 grams of like a semi-sweet chocolate or you could use a bittersweet chocolate and I just cut it into small pieces and let that melt watch your heat and then I'm also going to add my second type of chocolate I'm going to add two tablespoons 15 grams off an unsweetened cocoa powder you could use a regular unsweetened or you could use a dutch process which whichever type you have in the house or what you like and then because I used unsalted butter I'm going to have just a pinch but an eighth of a teaspoon of salt if you use salted butter then you just leave that out and now what we're going to add is 1 10 ounce bag which is what's that book 285 grams yes 285 grams of mid I use some miniature marshmallows make sure as you can see here I'm really stirring this what the marshmallows to melt now um you I use the miniature you could use the the large ones or I mean really you could use 10 ounces 285 grams of homemade marshmallows if you have that in your house if you're buying a bag of marshmallows and I found this out the hard way when I was testing this recipe really check the expiry date when you're buying marshmallows you want fresh ones because if they're not fresh they really don't melt as easily and I find the whole mixture isn't quite as smooth as when you have nice fresh soft ones so just keep that in mind always check your bag for that when you're buying them so what I'm doing here I want to make sure nothing sticks nothing burns so as they melt just keep stirring until it's all all your marshmallows are melted okay so we are errands all melted and smooth as you can see and all I smell is chocolate in here and so I'm going to add just for flavoring about 1 teaspoon 4 grams of pure vanilla extract I mean you don't have to if you don't want that too little kind of bit of vanilla flavor so just give that a good stir oh so now I'm just going to pour that over the top I love making these so easy and they're so good everybody loves them and you're you're done in like 10 minutes we all need these kind of recipes so we can just whip them up so now what we're going to do is just coat all of our rice krispies and our chocolate mixture I find these ones because of the I guess comes the chocolate I find the mixture not quite as sticky to work with as the regular rice krispies treats which by the way if you want to make those of course we have a recipe as and a video on the joy baking website if you want to do that so now at this point I'm going to add because we miss our third chocolate I'm going to add a half a cup 85 grams of semi-sweet chocolate chips you could use bittersweet use milk you could even use white chocolate chips or whatever or if you don't want that little crunch of chocolate chips you could just leave them out or some people like to sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top once you put them in the pan so that's another option but I like mine great in there sure you get to the bottom some chocolate gets stuck down there turn it hey looks good okay now I used a 9 by 13 I like mine thin I like to cut really big squares and I like them nice and thin you could use just if you want them thick you could use like a 9 inch square 23 centimeter square baking pans some people like to do that so if you don't have this size pan don't think oh I can't make these yes you can I'm going to use my hand these aren't too hot so I'm just going to press them in here and we are done isn't that great now at this point they are a little soft and sticky these ones I made the other day and they are you know they're you can see they're really quite firm this is quite this mixture is quite soft some people love it this way my kids always like the rice krispies treats as soon as I made them so I prefer to let this sit for maybe an hour to firm up and they get a little more crunchy not as soft and chewy either way but in so I'm going to eat one now which so you can see they're quite soft sticky and good here I know where they here nice and crispy soft chewy it is just like a rice crispy the regular one you have that nice marshmallow flavor but I really like the addition of all those types of chocolate if you're a chocolate lover which so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm you", "r9Xq4hnfAJk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys welcome back to my channel my name is Tyler if you're new here and you should totally subscribe if you haven't yet because what the heck are you doing no but you should do it I'm really excited about today's video because I love rice krispie treats I just think they're so delicious and they're like really really easy to make it takes a few ingredients and they're so delicious I don't think they get enough credit so I wanted to try make rice krispies treats but with out rice krispies so I got these variety packs of some of the most popular breakfast cereals I'm going to be using these instead of rice krispies we're gonna see how they come out I'm not gonna be like crushing them up or anything we're just gonna keep them in their true form but should be interesting to see how they come out I'm hoping man's at being like a really yummy marshmallow dessert bar but who the heck knows yeah so I'm gonna try make these and we're gonna test them all out I'm gonna let you guys know which ones are good which ones aren't hopefully they're all good I guess we're gonna find out alright guys so let's get cookin so the first cereal that I decided to do was fruit mousse so for the full recipe you would take 3 tablespoons of butter and melt it in a pot over the stovetop once the butter is melted then you're gonna add 4 cups of marshmallows and mix those around in the pan until they're melted now you want to make sure that you don't have the heat on the stove up too high because then it's gonna burn the marshmallow in the butter you also want to make sure that you go back and stir it kind of frequently so that it doesn't sit there and burn it all once the marshmallow is melted you're gonna add 6 cups of your favorite cereal into the mix and shut the heat off on the stove now keep in mind I minimize this recipe to a smaller scale so that I would be able to make a bunch of different marshmallow treats without wasting a ton of cereal so just keep that in mind it's gonna look like it's a lot more when you're actually doing the full recipe then you're gonna mix up this cereal and marshmallow with a spoon and once it's all mixed you're gonna place it into a pan now just for this experiment I used a cupcake pan just so that would separate the different cereals that I was trying but normally you would put the whole mix into a brownie pan or whatever rectangular pan you would like and then cut them into squares then spray the back of your spoon with some nonstick cooking spray and flatten the cereal ow [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys as you can see I finished making all of the Rice Krispies cereal barcel\u00f3 treat things I'm just waiting for a couple of them to cool completely down what they looks like then I'm gonna take them out of the pan put my plate and we're gonna try them to see what they taste like so I'll be back in a sec okay I'm back and I'm ready to eat these yeah they were pretty easy to get out of the pan I used a nonstick cupcake pan I think I'm a marshmallow on my tongue Bowl not the cleanest of jobs I'm also not the neatest person ever so I had marshmallow literally everywhere overall it's really simple these are all of the ones that I made so I'm just gonna go in and pick one and just start start trying them these are frosted Cheerios so I did frosted cheerios honey nut cheerios and regular Cheerios because I felt like I needed to try them all all right so I'm guess I'm just gonna go in and try it um it's good it's good but I need to try the other Cheerios to come there so let me get like a rejection plate okay so the frosted Cheerios were good but I don't have anything to compare it to so let me try this is the regular Cheerios and I think this might be kind of weird because like regular Cheerios are not sweet at all so having like sweet marshmallow with not speed might be kind of weird but let's see I don't know I definitely like the frosted Cheerios better because it is trying to we're having like a bland cheerio wispy marshmallow egg not my favourite not my favourite it's not horrible that's not my favorite these are honey nut cheerios and I think this might be good because honey nut cheerios are my favourite kind of cheerio you're gonna add their kind of sweet so it's alright I think that the honey flavor with the marshmallow flavor is kind of weird my god I'm never drink water I'm jogging today definitely the order of the Cheerios for me is frosted Cheerios honey nut cheerios regular Cheerios the frosted was deafening the best weird and also I wasn't a huge fan of the texture because they kind of got like chewy and I don't know I think I'm just used to the little regular Rice Krispies but next I'm gonna try Froot Loops I love a good fruit as if there's bad Froot Loops um yeah I love four loops I'm curious yep and this is probably why the fruity pebbles are so good because they taste like this but they're not as like difficult to chew no wonder people make those all the time this is amazing also our fruity pebbles and Froot Loops the same flavor like can someone please tell me that because I'm pretty sure I had it debate with somebody over this and I they're the same flavor to me fruity pebbles and food loops are the same thing they're just in a different form am i right am I wrong please let me know these are the questions I need answers to all right oh I'm so over sweet stuff like alright now I'm just gonna go with the good ol cocoa pebbles I'm interested to do these because they are literally a chocolate Rice Krispies and it was definitely the easiest to make and mix up and take out of the pan these look like legit rice krispies treats but chocolate and I am ready definitely my favorite so far they're just a better texture it doesn't feel like your teeth are getting pulled out it's just a good flavor I don't know chocolate marshmallows not uncommon thing so yeah okay next let's go with Trix now I've actually never had Trix I think that's frowned upon Trix are for kids which I'm not so but I also didn't have them as a kid anyway so these are tricks I don't know ooh they smell for Rudi and not like a fruit loop like a difference Brewis mother can do loans I don't know if I'm ready for that I don't know let's just see all right it is sweet however if you like sweet stuff it is really good it's actually it's actually tasted really good I'm gonna have to eat tricks from now on I'm not mad at that I'm not mad at it I think of it I might like it more than the three loops but I don't want to go that far because I love Froot Loops and I feel like I'm cheating on them such decisions why am I being exercised like why can't drink a lot because I'm filming a video next I'm gonna do corn pops because I don't really care about Clinton pop I don't actually think I've read corn pops either but they look boring they look bland you know this marshmallow looks like frickin cheese and unlike cheese bang screw you corn perhaps look really boring to me I don't know weird look cloth I've never had them by themselves I don't think so I feel like the cereal hearted I feel like it's so hard give me the other one no no I do abductors are coming right to freak out no no to be honest with you the taste isn't horrible though the taste isn't horrible it's actually pretty good but it's just so hard like you feel like your teeth are getting pulled out it's very chewy extremely difficult yeah no no please don't attempt that if you have any loose teeth next I'm gonna do cocoa puffs are these like the same as cocoa pebbles just in puffs I would assume but they look so different look at how much darker that cocoa puffs are I'm so concerned I thought that I thought that cocoa pebbles and cocoa puffs we're the same thing just in a different form and why is this so much darker anyway see nah am I crazy the 20 says I'm a stalker we know I don't know I thought it was on to something I don't know we're just gonna try it no no it's not no definitely the cocoa pebbles because I think it's just the fact that these are like balls like it's just not meant for this which was the whole point of doing this I just wanted to see like what the different importance we're gonna be but I definitely don't like the balls like that some of them family hanging them yeah it's just not meant for this the cocoa pebbles are the way to go for gonna do it like that hang on there little guy hey next I'm gonna do Golden Grahams and some Fritos crunch so these are the Golden Grahams I feel like they're kind of similar ish I know like the Golden Grahams aren't like a cinnamon sugary as some Mentos crunch let's try the Golden Grahams mmm it tastes really really good the squares are kind of awkward cuz they kind of just like miche's together when you bite down on it come on weird come chewy actually very chewy very good but the taste is good I like them better than the cocoa puffs let's try cinnamon toast crunch it tastes like a snickerdoodle I love snickerdoodles kind of chewy yes but manageable I like this a little bit better than the Golden Grahams but next is Lucky Charms contrary to popular belief I don't think that the marshmallow pieces in Lucky Charms are that good I'm sorry I know that they make like marshmallow only Lucky Charms but I just can't get into it I think it tastes like chalk I just want to go out of my way to buy Lucky Charms but I think this is gonna be interesting since there is like these mo pieces I think it's actually gonna taste good so let's see I have a bit of an issue it's the freakin marshmallow again look look at that it looks like top okay I like to just suck on the marshmallow pieces in my lucky charms and let them dissolve in my mouth and I think maybe they're better in milk than they are dry because they do probably dissolve a little bit just eating them dry like this I'm biting into it like there's me a bit of a texture issue I mean if you don't have a texture issue that it does taste really freaking good last but not least we are doing frosted flakes frosted flakes are a classic I love frosted flakes they're more than good they're great I shouldn't seriously just stop talking we haven't had a corn flake yeah we haven't had like was like cereal oh this is exciting ready guys okay I wanted to like it more but I just don't it's really really really really really hard to chew almost as hard as the Corn Pops I don't know take something like a hundred percent either and I thought frosted flakes but maybe it's just this whole marshmallow thing I don't know frosted flakes shouldn't be this texture I don't know how to describe it but they're not crunchy and they're not mushy they're just like difficult I don't know that's really depressing somebody says so out of all of these honestly like the cocoa pebbles for sure like mate Lucky Charms I would make if you like Lucky Charms marshmallows also the cinnamon toast crunch I like and the Froot Loops that I would do fruity pebbles does that make sense I'm sure that would be really good all the other ones like and and if you're gonna do Cheerios do the frosted trios but I mean regular rice krispies treats are honestly better I don't know if I'm disappointed or I think it's kind of what I expected definitely give it a try for yourself though and see which ones you like let me know in the comments if there's any other cereals that you want me to try this with I know there's like literally a million cereals I went down the cereal aisle on the supermarket and I was like what the heck like hostess makes honeyBun cereals they make churro Syria now I can't keep up so let me know in the comments what your favorite cereal is and which ones do

"TMiUcJ77u58": "hey it's Matt from ruff house studios a welcome to infused eats today's recipe is chocolate peanut butter crispy cereal bars infused with cannabis [Music] this recipes title is a mouthful but it's actually really simple and only requires five ingredients pet some cannabis unsalted butter marshmallows peanut butter cereal and chocolate and for the exact quantities and for the full written recipe please sign up at infused eats calm our interactive cannabis infused recipes website like most other cannabis infused recipes we will begin by processing and decarboxylated the cannabis this will activate the cannabinoids such as THC in the plant and give us the medicated feeling set we're all probably looking for here so a first way out and grind the cannabis into a coarse meal consistency use a grinder if you have one you can also chop it with a knife remove any large stems and seeds of course and I find using a piece of parchment paper creased with a fold down the center on a baking sheet is perfect for D carving set your oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit and a timer for one hour and 50 minutes now you could use the more standard 220 degrees for 2 hours but my oven has a minimum of 225 degrees so I just offset the time a little bit you could also even use higher temperatures for a shorter time but this is a kind of a long and low method of D carving and it has less chance of error now if you really know what you're doing you can use your eyes and your nose and just tell when it's activated by the smell when it's finished it will be noticeably darker and browner and you'll have a very pungent and aromatic aroma that will fill an entire house now this recipe will not include any prolonged heat for cooking the cannabis so we need to make sure that we fully activate the THC and this first and very important step the next step is to clarify your butter and you can do this in advance or you can also do it as you're activating the cannabis you could also skip this step if you really want to but it will kind of mess up the recipes quantities because you will lose about 1/3 of the initial butter weight so if you do decide to skip this step you need to use 1/3 less butter than the recipe calls for so first cube your butter and put it into a medium saucepan over medium heat and until the white milk solids begin to separate from the oil and they float to the top and it's like a creamy white layer that you can carefully scoop out using a spoon now you can use this stuff for a popcorn or something later but I usually just discard it and what we're doing is we're removing the water and we're doing that by evaporation and we're also removing the milk solids by separating them out and so we can do this and we're going to be left with all the oils and fat and that'll help us make our cannabutter more bioavailable and also our civil bars will be more shelf stable you can also use a coffee filter to find filter out the butter but that can take a while you have to be really patient and really careful cause the oil is really hot but once you have finished your oil will be golden and clear and you'll be almost perfect vehicle for our cannabinoids [Music] now we will combine the clarified butter and the activated cannabis in the top of a double boiler setup now if you use the pre-creased piece of parchment paper that I mentioned in the carboxylation step at the earlier in the video you'll see now why that was helpful it funnels easily and you can brush off the remaining keef and track homes that have fallen off in the heating process now in this process we're going to be infusing the activated cannabis into the clarified butter so that the saturated fats in the butter oil will acquire the THC and therefore facilitate the digestive system and transferring the cannabinoids into the bloodstream where it will finally meet its destiny and the eagerly awaiting endocannabinoid system that our body depends on daily to regulate pain hunger sleep and so many other natural human functions this infusion can go in 20 or 30 minute increments so check the water levels pretty often and stir the mixture in the double boiler and you want to let it infuse for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of three hours give or take a little bit kind of depending on your own preference and if you have the time to do it generally the longer the better [Music] once the infusion is complete the butter will be noticeably darker and green and now we're going to filter it through several layers of cheesecloth or like here I'm using a fine mesh metal screen and use some way to squeeze it but squeeze out as much of the infused butter oil as possible and the resulting kind of butter that you have left will get you flying high as it is but now we're going to go ahead and use this butter to make our crispy cereal bars [Music] now before we move on to the next step we need to separate and reserve back some of our cannon batter so we need to put one full tablespoon into our double boiler top bowl which we've cleaned and that's going to be for our chocolate later and then a second tablespoon we should be reserved back for buttering our 9 by 13 dish that we're going to use to form the bars in in the last step so you can go ahead and spread the butter evenly while it's still warm and it'll be easier and then set the pan aside and we'll come back to that later then the remaining butter we're going to take and put into a large saucepan over a medium heat into this butter we will add in all of the marshmallows and we're keep that over a medium to low heat and we're gonna let that heat as long as needed for the marshmallows to fully melt and you keep stirring them and flipping them over to help it melt quicker and it'll fully incorporate finally and the butter will no longer separate out from the marshmallow cream now this will take a little while so just let it go slow you don't want to overheat it so just take the time that you need and after a while the mixture is going to start boiling and when it's fully boiling from that point you're going to let it boil for another two to three minutes you don't want to let it get too hot though or your subha Rose will get really hard and then so hard they'll break your teeth when you when you cool them off so don't let it get too hot so after it starts boiling about two or three more minutes now we're gonna remove it from the heat and then we're going to pour your cereal while it's still hot into the mixture now you're going to keep mixing this and keep mixing it until the cereal is all evenly and fully coated now transfer this into the pre butter nine by 13 pan and it will start to get stiff pretty pretty quickly as it cools off so keep moving and as you flatten the bars out and evenly into the pan now take a big piece of wax paper or parchment paper and press the bars firmly and evenly into shape all across the pan even them out as best as you can with the palm of your hands pressing them in as hard as you can without breaking your - or your table but then when you pull off the paper your surface of the top of your cereal bar should be flat and smooth similar to this now this next step is optional but it's a good way to use the leftover butter and of course chocolate and peanut butter complement very nicely as everyone knows so add reason a large candy bar here we're going to break it into pieces and add it into the double boiler with our tablespoon of infused butter from previously put a lid on it and after about five minutes it should be melted enough so that you can start mixing it and you're gonna mix that and whisk it until it's glossy and then you can simply use a spoon or whatever you have to drizzle it back and forth across the top of your cob cereal bars now you could easily get creative with a staff and make designs or smooth nice coating over the top of it but I'll leave that up to you for me it's perfect just to let it melt down at the top and it adds that nice milky sweet extra dose of THC to the mix and who's going to complain about that now we need to let them cool off completely before you cut them into at least 12 pieces now if you do this you will get a much cleaner sharp edge but really who can ever really wait for a crispy cereal bars to cool off before you dig into them so we'll forgive you if you do like I did and go ahead and cut them immediately now these crispy cereal tarts are delicious while still a little warm or they're perfect to wrap and keep right on the cabinet for two or three days or you can keep them frozen for a couple of months and don't be afraid to experiment around with the flavors you could say for instance fruity pebbles with a white chocolate topping or Golden Grahams with dark chocolate topping the the possibilities are literally endless there so I hope you enjoyed this episode of infused eats if you did please like comment and share this

by adding different cereals on just add sugar we're bringing you some of our favorite sugary recipes that are short attempt and to light any sweet tooth so I already have some butter melting in a big pot and I'm just going to add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows so fun I'm pretty much making this just like your standard rice krispies treats but I know I feel like Rice Krispies have all the fun and what about the fruity pebbles and the golden grams of the world so I'm just going to have these marshmallows melt over a medium-low heat now my personal favorite combination to make is fruity pebbles Froot Loops and Trix it's pretty much the most colorful sweet cereal you can find but I feel like it's a lot of fun combining a couple so like Reese's puffs are really really yummy with chocolate Lucky Charms so you have like the chocolate flavor but then the peanut butter from the Reese's puffs another really great combo is Cinnamon Toast Crunch with Golden Grahams so freaking good so I think what's great about making these at home is you can literally have so much fun with all the mix ins and it's it's a basic recipe it's just three tablespoons of butter ten ounces of marshmallows and then six cups of any cereal you want as soon as your marshmallows are melted nice and smooth you're going to turn off the heat and add your cereal all right so I got my tricks my fruit lose my fruity pebbles pour them all in and then give it a good stir and fold the marshmallow all over the cereal you want to coat every single piece oh it smells so fruity in here and sweet and yummy mmm this looks fantastic now I'm just going to pour it into a pan that I've already sprayed with nonstick cooking spray now whatever sticks to the spatula I just think that I should keep because I'm the one that made these anyway so I'm going to save that for later and then a great tip for pushing all of the cereal down into the pan is just spray your hands a little bit of nonstick Spray a little rub rub and then just press and be very careful this actually isn't hot anymore but it's warm I like my rice krispies treats really really thick so I'm pushing this into a brownie pan but you could actually press it into a cooking pan too or a baking sheet and what's fun about making them at home is you can cut them out any shape you want you can use different cookie cutters heart crispy treats alright so now that it's packed in there I'm just going to let it cool before we cut them now that my marshmallow cereal treats are cut and cold you can even take them a step further by dipping them in chocolate so I actually have some melted chocolate right here and you can drizzle it or you could just dip them half away oh my gosh so this one that I made is the Reese's puffs with the chocolate Lucky Charms dipped it half way in milk chocolate and then I'm just going to let it harden for a second let's drizzle this one with some white chocolate you can really have fun with glazes frostings anything you want really and then while the glaze is wet I'm just going to sprinkle it with a little bit of sprinkles these are such great desserts I think people think of rice krispies treats as being a snack but if you brought these to a party let me tell you there won't be anything left these look so amazing and they're so yummy - rice krispie treats aren't just for kids thanks so much for watching let me know what your favorite combo is in the comment box below and don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and subscribe I'm brandy we'll see you next time on just dead sugar", "1ez_d0UoBrw": "[Music] are you a parent with a toddler that has way too many Cheerios lying around that's what happened to me and I needed to find a way to use them up that's why I'm making today some three ingredient cereal bars there are a sweet no big treat that couldn't be easier to make and the whole family can enjoy and I promise you that those extra Cheerios will be gone in a snap so come on grab your box of Cheerios and I'll show you how to make these [Music] what's up universe hook them back to my kitchen and in case you're new here I'm Julian I'm a chef I'm a mom and for this season of our show our focus is on some easy and yummy snacks that we can actually execute and film while our son Lincoln naps with all that said I think it's time to make some three ingredient cereal bars what you're gonna need is plain Cheerios peanut butter and honey this is almost embarrassing ly not a recipe it's so easy to make but you know what I feel like sometimes just watching the technique helps right you're gonna start out with a half a cup of peanut butter so this is like regular like Skippy jiff that kind of peanut butter can you use natural peanut butter or say something else like almond butter you know what I really don't know cuz I haven't tried it I think it should be okay cuz you're just looking for something gloppy I don't know if you want to give it a try let me know in the comments how it worked out for you and then you're gonna use a third of a cup of honey so you're just gonna pour that in and let these two mingle sometimes it helps to spray your measuring cup with a little bit of nonstick spray so that the honey will just slide out I've seen some recipes out there where you're using one to one as a ratio and I can understand where that's coming from because you're essentially making a glue that's holding together your Cheerios kind of like the concept of rice krispie treats so I guess more honey the stickier it is the better it holds but to me I find it a little bit too sweet actually even with a third of a cup from my preference I think it's still on the sweeter side but I think you need a little bit of it just so that it holds together this is gonna go on about medium-low heat for about three minutes or just until it all comes together and melts nicely just make sure you stir it every now and then and you're just looking for some ribboning like that okay that looks good so while it's nice and ribbony glossy and smooth that's when you grab your Cheerios and I'm using three and a half cups of plain Cheerios you don't want to use any kind of sweet and Cheerios even multigrain or Honey Nut because it'll be too sweet and if you have a little toddler or little baby then you probably had this in your pantry already and I think Lincoln's just at the stage where he's kind of outgrowing it we had a good run he's two years old now so he was fine just eating plain Cheerios but now I think he's kind of bored of them so now we just have like an excess so this is coming out of pure realistic necessity then you're just gonna toss and coat until every single little cheerio is covered with a glossy mixture it's tempting to just grab a spoon and eat it right out of the bowl and then you're just gonna grab yourself an 8 by 8 pan so I'm just using this little square one right here and then you're gonna cut down a piece of parchment that 15 side and if it looks like it's just rising up it might help to use a little bit of nonstick spray just to weigh it down so there and now it's kind of glued down to the bottom okay and then you're just gonna dump this right into your parchment paper the parchment paper helps the Cheerios not to stick to the dish because we're not baking this this is a no bake recipe but it is gonna spend time into refrigerator and then once it hardens you want to be able to lift it out easily and you can see how this little square baking dish is the perfect size for this amount just going to grab a spatula and push the Cheerios to all the corners try to get it nice and even the first couple times I made this cuz you know these kinds of recipes are all over Pinterest I was wondering why my Cheerios kept falling apart the key is you really have to press the living daylights out of them because you're not baking it and all its relying on is the peanut butter and honey hardening up in the fridge I can't help myself mmm well you can't go wrong with peanut butter and honey if you were already using a measuring have to measure up your peanut butter you can use the bottom of that you can use the bottom of a bowl or a cup just anything that will allow you to have more impact because like I said you really want to take the time to firmly press without crushing and crumbling your Cheerios and that's it so we're just gonna pop this in the fridge for about an hour you need that chill time to allow it to solidify and then we're just gonna unveil it and cut it into pieces [Music] all right so it's been about an hour and we're just gonna oh and it is nice and firm I can tell I'm gonna use this little pit part Schmidt and perfect and you can cut it any way you want you can cut it in like lumbar form if you want but because I didn't put a ton of honey and I'm afraid they're smaller I cut it the more crumbly it'll get I think I'm gonna go for about 16 pieces from this one 8 by 8 square wow that crunch yeah it helps together guys I mean the more time it spends in the fridge the easier time you'll have having it hold together I mean I guess if you want to be super generous you could leave it in these long bar forms but I think it's a little bit too much cereal treat for me so I'm gonna cut it smaller all right they're so cute and a little crumbly and so now I think all there is left to do is taste it [Music] I know this is no surprise to you how these tastes because I make this often these days so but we'll just taste it for you guys again and these are best served cold actually I think they have to be cold because they'll start to crumble apart as they get to room temperature so the longer they stay in the fridge the better luck you'll have with cutting them and the better luck you will have without them crumbling apart well these are pretty solid as it is so delicious it's not surprising because yeah I had even these this morning for breakfast well as you can tell I'm trying to get rid of our Cheerios for sure okay ours is crumbling apart but my batch before this wasn't because I kept it in the fridge overnight this one we're like rushing to film this so it's not that solid yet but you get the concept right nice and sweet but not too sweet not too sweet mm-hmm I guess you were saying about the honey like the amount mm-hmm put in it gets a little harder but then it gets a little too sweet yeah I just want a glass of milk with this because it's so peanut buttery yeah actually that's immiscible really good or even a cup of coffee in the morning this is a great snack to have even in the morning or on the run or you know when you just have like that Snickers moment where you're just like hangry in the middle of the day this is a great thing to just keep in your fridge so anyways there's not much to say to this except for they're just sweet and satisfying peanut buttery goodness so if you enjoyed watching this recipe then please let

later [Music] now mr. Bao his name he changed once or twice but an engineer to stay", "zGiwryI7R90": "hi welcome to time and delight anibal's my name is Lizbeth this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back so today I'm just gonna say real quick video on how to show you how to turn your regular can of butter that everybody makes - how to turn this into this into actual real butter so when you make this what you really have is butter oil your THC and if you use less it's less a thin and then you've just got that all floating around there you haven't really created an emulsion so a meaning that you don't have even THC distribution to your butter doing this actually creates an emulsion and evenly distributes your THC throughout your throughout your whole butter and you're actually making butter and doesn't this look way better than this alright so I'm just gonna get in the steps on how you do that alright thanks for joining so what you're gonna need to turn your lovely your can of butter into that beautiful can of butter is you're gonna need either soy or sunflower lecithin and for a pound of butter you would use about a tablespoon or you can use gora gum as well it's a it's an excellent emulsifier this is what I prefer to use is the Gore gum because it has no taste I personally hate the taste of lecithin I can taste it in everything so I prefer the Gore gum but that is totally up to you so what you're gonna do is I'm for gora gum if you're gonna use that you're going to always recommend to use a strainer because it has a tendency to lump up and you're just gonna mix that in or sorry sprinkle it on top not mix it in yet I'm just gonna mix that in and then we're gonna put our butter into the fridge or the freezer for it to partly solidify so we want it to about solidify halfway so about two about there I want it to be firm or a solid and the rest of its gonna stay liquid if you go put it in the freezer it goes fairly quickly so don't forget about it otherwise you'll have to melt it and start again or if you want to give yourself a little time put it in the fridge all right so I had mine in the fridge for about 10 minutes mine was already at room temperature so it's a little bit firm but it's still okay because I'm still nice and soft in the middle and I'm nice and firm on the side so what you want to do is just scrape the side down here make sure all this solid gets in there and then you're going to use your blender or you can use a hand mixer or you can do this with a whisk as well [Music] so we're gonna whip that up for about a minute or two and then we're gonna put it back in the fridge I'm gonna scrape down the sides first and we'll put it back in the fridge to do the exact same thing again all right so this time I just put it in the freezer for like two three minutes do the same thing get the more solid stuff off the sides [Music] [Music] now see how when I clean the sides we're still getting a color different difference there so we're gonna do the I'm gonna put it in the fridge one more time to do that partial solidify and we're gonna continue this process until we scrape the sides like that and everything is exactly one color one homogeneous texture alright so round three again scoop it off you see how it's getting thicker in the courage time [Music] [Music] [Music] well let's check our size so see now when I pull the size the color is all pretty much the same not pretty much the same it is the same I have a little bit of separations streaking so I'm gonna do one more pass of that and then that's gonna make it just perfect and also see how much later your butter is becoming that's so dice all right this should be the last one it's important to get all that firm that solidified butter to get that in because that's what helps with creating that emulsion of the butter there I do that too with the excess off my blades now see now when I pull it from the sides everything is one uniform color there is no difference from the stuff that I'm pulling off the sides from what's in the middle and this is when you know that you have a fully emulsified blended THC well distributed butter the plus it looks really nice now your butter is ready to put in the container you want to store it in now this is what I like to do because I do obviously a lot of cooking as you can tell I like to pre measure it and these cake pop molds are great because they hold a tablespoon perfectly so I pre measure around the tablespoon fill her up that's it I fill these all up and then I'll flatten them down put them in the freezer and then once they're frozen I keep them in a ziplock baggie that way I just take out and what I need usually most of my recipes or a quarter cup so I just take out four of these that way you don't always have to keep taking out your butter from the fridge and waiting for it to get to room temperature or constantly microwaving it to get it soft you can just pull it exactly what you need um that's my little tutorial there on how to do how to turn your butter into some really nice beautiful can of butter basically really turning can of oil into can of butter because when you do it the other way really you just have melted butter oil and your THC it's not technically butter and once I get them all filled up I'm not gonna make you watch that I just smack them down so that they get nice and flat and then I put them in the freezer and that's it all right so that was my little quick tutorial on how to turn your butter oil your can of butter oil into actual can of butter and I hope you enjoyed it if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to put them in the comments I always love to hear from you and I think that's about all I've got for you today so you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for joining [Music]", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching

strawberries and cream rice krispies treats and for us choco holics out there a salted caramel chocolate treat inspired by a Twix bar be sure to give this video a big thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe below I release new videos every Sunday so make sure you hit that notification bell so you don't miss a video in the meantime we're going to go ahead and get started with our unicorn birthday rice krispies treats first I wanted to show you guys some gorgeous sprinkles that I found this is perfect for these unicorn treats or birthday treats and you can use any of these bright beautiful colors for the chocolate topping but I'm going to use this peel one all right here we have all of our ingredients laid out now I'm going to grab three tablespoons of butter put it in my pot let it melt on low heat I'll add one teaspoon of vanilla extract to give it that yummy vanilla cake flavor a pinch of kosher salt mix it all together let it melt completely alright this looks good now I'm going to add four cups of mini marshmallows I'll stir it around and let the butter coat it completely this way it doesn't stick and we'll let it melt until the marshmallows become this yummy sticky cloud perfect I'll pull it off heat and then I'll add in five cups of rice krispies and half a cup of our rainbow sprinkles how gorgeous give it a good mix make sure every rice krispies is coated with that yummy marshmallow looks nice and sticky now I'll grease my pan that's nine by nine just so nothing sticks and while it's still warm I'll transfer my rice krispies I'll flatten it out with my spatula make sure everything's even I love those speckles of pinks and blues so pretty and while it cools down I'm going to work on my topping in a large microwave safe Bowl I'm adding one and a half cups of white chocolate and 2 tablespoons of neutral oil I'm using avocado oil here because it's nice and neutral but you can use vegetable oil canola oil anything that won't add flavor to our white chocolate now I'll microwave it for a minute and a half thirty seconds at a time just until it gets melted I'll pull it out and I'll just keep stirring until it's nice and smooth like this now taking my food coloring I'm just going to add a few drops at a time just until I get the perfect color I think this can be a little more blue one more drop okay mix mix mix oh yeah this looks good then I'll immediately pour it over our rice krispies treats mmm and then just spread it around cover every crack and for the fun part sprinkles oh I love how this looks so pretty this would be great for a celebration or just a fun snack make sure I get all the edges and that's it I'll let it sit until the chocolate gets nice and hard and then we'll just go ahead and cut into it I like cutting them into squares DPD to do this one looks like a good piece got a lot of sprinkles nice layer mmm let's dig in [Music] this is a great alternative to a regular birthday cake and it's much easier to transport - I love all the fun festive colors of this nice cute layer of the blue frosting so good alright now we're moving on to our next one which is our strawberries and cream rice krispies treat for this recipe I'm using freeze-dried strawberry slices to give it some real fruit flavors freeze-dried strawberries are great and they look like this now I'm just going to take one bag and crush it up I'm looking for a good mix of chunks and powdery pieces to really infuse our Krispies here this looks perfect and here's our spread of ingredients and again I will start with the butter half three tablespoons here that I'll add to my pot on low heat add in half a teaspoon of vanilla extract a pinch of kosher salt and I'll mix it all together until the butter is melted here's a quick tip while the butter is melting try to swirl it around the sides of the pot so that the marshmallows don't stick later alright once it's all melted I'm going to add in 10 ounces or one whole bag of mini marshmallows same thing keep stirring until the marshmallows are all melted nice and sticky perfect now I'll pull it off heat and I'll pour in this time 6 cups of rice krispies and one bag of our freeze-dried strawberries mix it all around and again while it's still hot we'll pour it into our greased pan and we'll just spread it all out with my greased spatula and let it cool while I work on the topping again here's one and a half cups of white chocolate with two tablespoons of neutral oil I'm just going to nuke it again for a minute and a half let it melt then stir it around nice and smooth but this time I'm just going to spread it directly on make sure to cover the whole thing now taking my second bag of non crushed freeze-dried strawberries I'm just going to sprinkle it directly onto the white chocolate just to add some more strawberry flavors I'll Pat it down a little bit to make sure it sticks into the chocolate and let it cool completely until the white chocolate hardens mmm it's so beautiful it's like a wallpaper pattern all right let's give this baby a try a nice thick layer of white chocolate and I love all the real bits of strawberries so much texture in this one so pretty this reminds me of those milk and cereal bars I could technically double as breakfast here I love how the strawberries add natural flavour and sweetness actually I think this one's my favorite here but I see the most decadent one for last our salted caramel chocolate rice krispies alright again here's all of our ingredients laid out I'll grab the butter melt it add our vanilla extract a pinch of kosher salt mix it around let it melt and then this time I'm adding 1/3 cup of our caramel sauce it's the fleur de sel caramel sauce from Trader Joe's and it's a great alternative to making your own let it not mix it all together to the full add a whole bag or ten ounces of mini marshmallows give it a good mix and it's like caramel popcorn kind of not anymore alright mix it all around and once it's molten marshmallow take it off heat this time we're adding six and a half cups of rice krispies here because you want it to soak in all of that sauce mix it until everything's coated and again in our greased baking pan while it's still hot let's transfer it out I'll just smooth it flatten it make sure it's even and let it cool while we work on our topping this time in a band Marie I have a saucepan with a little bit of water I'll place my mixing bowl right on top then I'll add in one and a half cups of dark chocolate chips we're tempering the chocolate on a Banbury here because it provides a softer heat I don't want to scorch the chocolate by melting it directly in the pan because we want a smooth and delicious layer and I'll just let it melt with that soft heat stir it around once we get our beautiful chocolate sauce I'll just spread it in beautiful waves on top of the rice krispies [Music] perfect I love the texture that this gives off it's like an ice-skating on Chalkley and I'll just sprinkle a dusting of sea salt just to give it some texture once the chocolate has completely hardened again we'll cut them into squares now let's give it a try mmm I love the sea salt right on top and we have a nice thick layer of chocolate the caramel is not too sweet at all because it's balanced by the sea salt on top and the chocolate just adds so much flavor I love chocolate oh now I can't decide which one's my favorite anyways these treats are great but they're even better to share like I did at my event yesterday how I packaged it up was I took the anthro monogrammed mugs placed a treat bag right inside of it and filled it up with my rice krispies treats I stacked them three high and I had to trim them a little bit to make them fit the cup and to close it up I just added a pretty ribbon this Tolle one is perfect and look at this treat bag it's so cute right my gift to you the event was so much fun I was at Anthropologie & Company Walnut Creek ended a spring strawberry lemonade theme where we made no big cheesecakes and a refreshing strawberry lemonade I got to pick and choose all the utensils and bowls it was like a dream come true thank you so much to everyone who came out let's do it again soon if you guys want to know about future events that I'm doing be sure to follow my instagram at honeysucklecatering and if you guys are interested in hearing about how I got started with honeysuckle what I'm up to I recently did a podcast interview with the Maslow peak and I've linked the interview in the description box below we're

healthy and fun videos before baby comes so I will see you guys soon bye if you like this video you'll also love my other no-bake cheesecake video and the Cherry Garcia bars [Music]", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "kCNQUvEkuKQ": "[Music] drop the

I've teamed up with ChocZero and HighKey Foods to bring you guys something that you have been longing for if you're on the keto diet or sugar-free diet. And that is rice crispy treats. This recipe for keto rice crispy treats only involves 4 ingredients. And it is so easy to make. Let's get started! I was super excited when HighKey Foods came out with their line of protein cereals. They have protein \"rice\" like cereals. This one is frosted flavor, they also have a chocolate and a cinnamon\nflavor too. And this cereal is delicious. If you just want to snack on it on it's own it actually tastes like rice crispy treats\nalready. But we're going to jazz it up a bit and really get that flavor of homemade rice\ncrispy treats. And the cool thing about these HighKey cereals is that there is 0 net carbs. Besides the HighKey protein cereal I'm also going to be using butter. And then a couple of products by ChocZero. The first one is their Sugar-free Vanilla\nSyrup. This one is going to add some vanilla flavor. And then I'm also going to be using their White Chocolate Baking Chips. We're going to melt these down and pour it over our rice crispy mixture. And this is going to help it stick together. But also give it like a marshmallowy type\nof flavor. In a medium bowl we're going to add 2 cups of our HighKey frosted protein cereal. You're also going to need 2 tablespoons of melted butter. 2 tablespoons of ChocZero's Vanilla Syrup. And 1/2 cup of ChocZero's White Chocolate\nBaking Chips. These white chocolate chips are sugar free and sugar alcohol free as well as their syrups\ntoo. Combine all of these ingredients together. And then we're going to put it into our dish. I recommend lying down a piece of parchment\npaper in your baking dish. It just makes it easier to pop them out when you want to enjoy them. You can leave these at room temperature to\nharden, but I actually recommend putting in the refrigerator for several minutes. That way it sets quicker and you can get on to enjoying your rice crispy treats. We hope you guys enjoyed this video. Make sure you tag ChocZero and HighKey with your photos of your keto approved sugar free rice crispy treats.", "ISscxKl60Y8": "hi everybody everybody I'm back and today today Gina young is going to show you all how to make fruit loop breakfast bars here's what you're going to meet you will need six cups of fruit loops okay and believe it or not let's say this is dudududududu at ten point one ounce box of fruit loops this whole box is the six cups all right you will need some type of icing and me preferably I'm a chose the cream cheese icing because we're going to drizzle this with cream cheese I see it has a little easy quick spout there alright you will need salt and we're just going to use a pinch of salt believe it or not but this pinch of salt goes a long way and it brings out the flavors in sweet dishes okay we are going to use to fund milos these are the miniature malos that the miniature marshmallows that have the different colors and the different flavors the flavor is orange strawberry lemon and lime alright and then you will need ten ounces of excuse me of marshmallows you can use the mini ones or these big ones here whatever is fine as long as you use ten ounces this is a twelve ounce bag so I'm going to use you know just about all of it but not all of it all right now over here I have the pan that I'm going to use is just an aluminum pan that I've taken a paper towel and I put a little bit of cooking oil which is a vegetable oil on my paper towel and I just rub the vegetable oil all over this okay so that our breakfast bars don't stick to this all right over here I'm going to be using this wok okay this wok is the woof woof gang puck collection I know I reason why I'm telling you all this because a lot of you love this wok and want to know where you can find it at you can find the Wolfgang collection of pots and pans on Amazon now we are going to use a half a stick of butter then we're going to start to melt our butter so turn your pan on to medium-high heat and one thing that I want you all to know a little trick that I did I took a little bit of oil and you can see the oil on the bottom in a rubbed oil all up the sides and all at the bottom how come you did that Gina well the reason why I did that is because we're getting ready to cook something it's going to be really sticky which is our marshmallows and I don't want my marshmallows to stick all to my pan you know not it's going to naturally stick but I don't want it to stick too much so I coat it my pan with a little bit of oil okay all up the sides now we're going to go in with our 1/2 a stick of butter and get it to get nice and melty I'm gonna put that in just like so let's come this way so y'all can see exactly what I'm doing I hope you all are having a great day today today is Tuesday I hope you all are having a great work week if you haven't had a chance to check out my video for the no baked key lime pie that I made check that video out because that pie is absolutely amazing do you hear me if you never tasted that before that's the recipe for you you definitely want to try it so make sure to watch that video let's go ahead and put our butter in just like so okay and we want to get this nice nice nice and melty once it melts all the way and we're going to put our 10 ounces of marshmallows if you haven't seen my video for the rice krispies treats I've made a rice krispies treat that had Oreo cookies in it be sure to check that video out because it's awesome as well and it's very simular to this recipe except for this recipe doesn't have rice piece of it now if you wanted to put rice krispies in this recipe absolutely you can you can use three cups of rice krispies and you can use three cups of the Froot Loops and you got breakfast bars absolutely if you wanted to use the fruity pebbles you know they look like the rice krispies you could use those and mix them with regular rice krispies as well like possibilities are endless when you want to make some type of breakfast bar or a rice krispies treat you can pretty much do what you want to do and it's a lot of fun and here's the thing get those kids in the kitchen get them in the kitchen to help you because when you give them an entrance that interests in cooking when they're smaller when they grow up they understand the art of cooking they understand what cooking is all about okay I'm just gonna swivel this around just a little bit just like so like I did my oil okay and then we're gonna go ahead and start putting our ten ounces of marshmallows in not the whole bag because the whole bag would mean I'd be using 12 ounces okay now what heat I'm gonna turn this just onto a medium heat because it's very very very easy to burn this and you don't want to burn this be very watch this very very very closely okay highly suggested that you do not walk away from this while you're melting these down because this can burn alright see this and so the marshmallows are well coated in the butter okay and then I'm not gonna have a pan that's gonna be too hard to clean up because we coated it with the butter and the oil as well so what I want you to do I want you to bring your cereal close to you because here in just a second very quick this is all going to happen so quick you're gonna want to put your cereal in and then I love I love the idea of putting the cream cheese icing on top now here's the thing you can do like I'm gonna do I'm gonna just kind of drizzle it all over the breakfast bar if you want it to you can completely cover the top of that and when you cut it you can turn them upside down and they'll have a layer of icing at the bottom and then you have your cereal at the top oh absolutely so like Dakota my 10 year old when he goes to school in the morning tomorrow all he'll have to do is take him a sip of milk and grab a breakfast bar and get ready to head out to that bus stop so that's what I have planned for him for breakfast tomorrow he'll be really excited absolutely he will be he went crazy over the cookies and cream rice krispie treats that I made they loved them even the bigger kids they went crazy over it see this here and I'm just kind of just going you know scraping the sides and the bottom so that nothing sticks and nothing burns but we're looking just fine this is beautiful this is what you want just like this nothing nothing hard about this recipe I'm going to reach over the camera really quickly then I'm gonna grab my little ones and I just want to open them because we'll be using those shortly as well all right these are just about where I want them but you want them to liquify all the way before you add your cereal okay we don't want any big you know any big marshmallows in this mixture make sure it's all the way melts it and me also time go ahead and put you some salt in watch how much I put in guys seriously that's it all you need is that little pinch and really seriously it really does a difference if you wanted to put vanilla extract in here absolutely you could but I don't suggest using the brown one use the white or the clearing color vanilla extract to give it a little bit extra flavor oh yeah we marshmellows just about done baby these marshmallows are talking to me all I'm thinking about right now I'm thinking about s'mores I'm thinking about going can't be not like my brain is just going my brain is just going and going when we wake camping we make what you call a banana s'mores boats in the banana s'mores boats you take aluminum foil you slice open your banana in the rind so you slice it open you put marshmallows in you put your Hershey's chocolate pieces on top of that you crush up your what do they call guys you crush up your graham crackers you close the aluminum foil you throw that bad boy in the fire and you cut banana s'mores boats you have never guys seriously you have never tasted a s'mores until you've had Gina Young's banana s'mores boats I actually have a video for that be sure to check it out it's awesome okay what we're gonna do we probably got about one more minute we're gonna go ahead and put our I'm turning the stove off I'm gonna go ahead and get ready to put our cereal in there okay and I believe we're gonna do it right now because these bigger marshmallows yep they're turning right into liquid let's go guys it's like this and now you want to put a little bit of elbow grease and then let's come off of the stove because we don't want to loop this anymore okay but you want to move fast move fast and use that elbow grease guys you all huh you all know what elbow grease is I'm sure your grandmom told you when you were cleaning use that elbow grease I know mine's bit all right see this here beautiful this right here this

what Jena Young has up her sleeve now check me out guys bringing us into the effect and we're going to hold on guys I'm trying to I don't want my arm in the picture let's put this in here and you want to kind of work quickly this pan is heavy and it's hot and I'm working with my right hand even though I'm left-handed I would prefer to be holding this pan with my left hand but that's okay just get it in there right there you go okay good that pan got heavy on me so if you have any problems if you have any problems pushing this down into the pan just take a little bit of oil and put it on your spatula or you can use your hip put a little bit of oil in your hand and then just start pressing everything down in until you get your treats into this pan give me one second guys I will put some oil on my hands and then I want to press everything in place give me just a second okay I got oil on my hands oh yeah and now we're ready to go I was kind of struggling a little bit see my hands and will

crush that crunch mmm good night guys", "y1gKtWyK4IY": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie drawers gave joy baking calm today we're going to make rice krispies treats everyone seems to love these squares and they're so quick and easy to make the only thing if you've ever made these before you know that this mixture is really sticky so the trick is to either butter or spray all your bowls your utensils pots pans and then everything will work out perfectly so I'm going to use a nine inch square which is 23 centimeter baking pan now if you want because I like my rice krispies treats quite thick you could use a 9 by 13 23 by 33 centimeter pan if you like a thinner square so as you can see just spray or you could butter it and then in a large bowl I've also sprayed this bowl put 6 cups of rice krispies that's 150 grams and have that ready and then I am going to spray my spatula again and I'm going to spray we need a medium sized saucepan so I'm also gonna spray the inside of that because we're going to melt some marshmallows and we don't want that mixture to stick to the pot so the first thing we're gonna do is put 3 tablespoons about 40 grams I'm using unsalted butter and I'm just gonna put that in my saucepan and along with the quarter or just an eighth of a teaspoon of salt just a touch of salt now you could instead use salted butter you could use margarine you could use one of those soft buttery spreads if you like to use that as well and then I'm just going to melt this over medium heat and have ready a 10 ounce which is about 285 gram bag of I just like to use the miniature marshmallows because they melt fast but you could use a large marshmallows or you could even use homemade marshmallows that you just kind of cut out so just melt your butter okay and now jump in my marshmallows and then you want to stir constantly and just heat until all the marshmallows are melted and you have a nice smooth mixture okay so remove that from the heat I didn't mention but try to use marshmallows that are really fresh because they melt really nicely if you've ever used ones that are a little stale they don't melt quite as nicely as the fresh ones so then I'm just going to add a half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract just add a little extra flavor and then just pour over your rice krispies as you can see and these are really fast to make great afterschool treat for the kids and then just stir to coat all your Rice Krispies now some people like to fold ins you know eating raisins or chocolate chips or M&M something like that or sprinkles I just like mine plain and then looks pretty good hopefully I've got it off sure you get the bottom of the bowl and then pour into your pan it's a sticky part here I didn't spray this so make sure you spray everything I'm just going to what I often do is just spray my hands and then find that the easiest I mean you could use a butter or a piece of wax paper and do that but I find it easier just use my hands okay so just press firmly and you're done so um just let these cool you know 10-15 minutes and then just use a sharp knife and cut them and they can be covered and stored for a few days so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm [Music]", "4qykX_A4l0k": "hey guys welcome back to nziy and today we are making three ingredient cereal rice krispie treats so what you're going to need is some mini marshmallows uh three tablespoons of butter and your choice of cereal for me i'm choosing fruity pebbles so let's get right into this okay guys so now we have the pan here and be careful um make sure you have a parent nearby so i'm gonna add this butter in right there looks scary so now we have this little like wooden spoon and now we're just gonna go all around the pan i was about to say both i don't know why but we're gonna go all like this with the butter hashtag butter and the comments so we have it all melted and now you have to add the whole entire bag of mini marshmallows okay add in the whole bag oh okay so now you want to start mixing it around until it's like that's like say a liquid almost kind of ish as you can see they're melting and actually pretty fast it's melting pretty fast i thought it was gonna take longer but it probably isn't so yeah i'm just gonna start mixing this okay guys so it's all melted it should look like this almost like white chocolate but now we're going to add four cups of cereal so let's add it in that sounded cool to me okay so now you just want to mix it in really good um into the marshmallows and to me this sounds very like satisfying so like i really want you guys to enjoy this so listen [Music] so it's all mixed in it should look like this almost like spider webs kind of but now you want to add it into a pan but make sure you spray the pan first which we already sprayed it so now we want to get it and just put it in we already like kind of spread it out in the pans but we need to spread it out a little more so a little hack because it's very sticky as you could get a spatula and spray it and it won't stick as you can see so yeah we're just going to mush it all around so it stays in place in like the form i guess you could say in the form of the pan so you kind of just want to mush it to the sides and in the corners and make sure you mush it down real good and i guess you could say everywhere around the pan so we have it all spread out in the pan it should be like this and now we're just going to leave it out to dry and we'll taste test it when it's all dried three hours later so it's all hardened now and it's supposed to look like this and it didn't even take that long it took like maybe two minutes yeah so now i'm going to cut it into little squares now guys be careful with this because but that's why that's why i'm using a butter knife so i don't cut my self and yeah so i'm gonna cut it into little squares like this but i'm not gonna take the time to do every single one right now which i will later not right now i'm so excited okay whoa guys like you have to try this this is so good oh my gosh and then i do recommend fruity pebbles because it just gives it more i guess you could say a fruit taste because it gives it more like of a sweet taste you guys have to try this okay guys you're gonna even shape it however you want like make all that spiral or you can mush it up into a ball like that and go so i'm gonna give this recipe a solid nine and a half out of ten the half of it the other half is just because it's a kind of a little bit too sweet but i still really like it so i give it a a nine and a half out of ten and thank you guys for watching don't forget to like subscribe and turn on the post notifications so you know when i post a new video don't forget to d and then i and don't worry", "eltQtPlfKGI": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I'm going to be showing you how to make red white and blue infuse rice krispie squares these are the best rice to be squares you're ever going to have not only because they're infused but also because it's super gooey gooey chewy marshmallowy and they are absolutely amazing you'll only need a few ingredients that takes less than 10 minutes to make here's what you're going to need 1/4 cup of butter 4 cups of rice krispies 4 cups of mini marshmallows some vanilla white chocolate chips or candy wafers oil based food colouring as regular food coloring won't work and red white and blue sprinkles the first step is to melt your fire now you want to make sure you do this on a really low temperature like a Tabo between 2 and 4 and you don't want it to overcook or Brown where your rice krispies won't be goobie and really marshmallow okay they'll be a little bit more dry and crunchy after about three or four minutes when your butter is almost completely melted you'll keep the temperature on low and you'll add in your marshmallows and we're going to let these melt really slowly now that you can see the marshmallows are starting to kind of foam up and expand that means it should be pretty much done so yeah that looks about perfect now I'm gonna take it off the heat so now that off the heat I'm gonna add in about a tablespoon of vanilla this just bumps it up in flavor a little bit and I'm gonna pour my rice krispies in I'm also going to add a few extra marshmallows so it's extra marshmallow and gooey now I'm gonna add some red white and blue sprinkles of course this is optional alright so that looks like it mixed together pretty well now I'm just going to put it into my baking dish I lined my baking dish with some parchment paper and then I'm gonna also spray it [Music] now I'm just gonna lightly push the rice krispies into the pan and then let them sit uncovered not in the fridge for a couple hours until they have hardened up a bit and we can cut them into our squares it's been about two hours and the rice krispies are now ready to cut [Music] I'm also cutting them to be a little bit thinner so that they'll fit into their bags I melted some white chocolate with a little bit of coconut oil to help smooth it and then dipped the rice krispies square bars into the white chocolate covered it with some sprinkles and then put it in the fridge to sit and cool [Music] [Music] [Music] happy 4th of July from your friendly Canadian neighbors I hope you guys have a wonderful day and enjoy these rice krispie squares thank you guys so much for watching bye", "a0CMNP-JR24": "hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter rice krispies treats these little treats are absolutely delicious they are soft and they're sweet and they're sticky topped with milk chocolate they're just absolutely irresistible and they're super easy to make so without further ado let's get started alright because we were working with a candy of sorts we need to have everything prepared ahead of time so when we get going everything's ready for us we don't have to stop and they can start to harden up on us so I am getting my dish ready here or pan if you will it is an 8 inch by 8 inch glass pan because I like thick rice krispie treats if you like them thinner use a 9 by 13 pan and I'm just going to line my pan with some aluminum foil this is going to a facilitate easy cleanup and it is also going to help us get our rice krispies treats out of the pan because if you've ever made rice krispies treats you know what a pain it can be to get them out of a pan so and because we're working with this candy and we don't want anything to stick I'm going to grease the foil with some vegetable oil you could also use butter or Crisco you know whatever you want to use that you normally use degrees so be sure and cover all the sides of your foil all the way up the sides all along the bottom be sure and get in the corners because that's what things tend to stick and then just go ahead and take your pan and set that off to the side now to make our peanut butter candy make sure that we're going to coat our rice krispies or not right or krispies with I've got a pan over medium heat here it's actually between medium and medium-high I'm going to add in 1 cup of corn syrup this is light corn syrup caber brand if it makes any difference if you are not in the United States use glucose syrup which is pretty much the same thing but there is no alternative to the corn syrup you know it's just it's part of rice krispies treats and then you want to add in 1 cup of white granulated sugar as well as 1 tablespoon of water now the traditional rice krispies treat or a peanut butter rice krispies treat recipe does not call for water I use water because it helps to this mixture come together helps the sugar and corn syrup come together but it also guarantees that they stays soft if you've made these before using just corn syrup peanut butter and sugar you know that they can kind of have a tendency to get hard on you if you ever cook it adding the water helps prevent that so just using a spatula I'm going to mix this mixture together over medium-high heat stir this constantly while it's coming up to heat and you know it is ready when it starts to bubble around the outside of your pan once it starts to bubble get it off of heat and once you take that off heat continue stirring it kind of help to cool it down a little bit and then you want to add in 1 cup of creamy peanut butter I'm using creamy peanut butter if you want to use chunky peanut butter by all means go ahead I like mine smooth so that's what I'm using and again I'm just going to mix this until the peanut butter is mixed into the corn syrup and sugar mixture before I get going too far I'm also going to add in one teaspoon of vanilla extract as well as a quarter of a teaspoon of salt again neither of these ingredients is in the original peanut butter rice krispies treat recipe they're just what a highlight to add to mine this salt kind of helps to neutralize so it's not just so Chloe sweet at all you taste is sugar it kind of mellows everything out and of course vanilla vanilla makes everything better too you just want to mix all these ingredients together until everything is combined and you don't have any chunks of peanut butter left unless of course you're using chunky peanut butter and then you want to pour your mixture over 6 cups of puffed rice cereal the technical term not rice krispies basically if you want to use rice krispies by all means go ahead but these are not real rice krispies so go ahead and get that peanut butter mixture in there and then using a spatula you want to gently fold these ingredients together gently fold that peanut butter and sugar mixture into the rice krispies don't go all hog wild with a spoon because you're just going to break up your cereal you want your cereal to remain whole as much as possible so just gently fold this together but you need to work kind of quick because this mixture does harden up and get really sticky really quick so do the best that you can and once all your rice krispies are evenly coated go ahead and dump this mixture all into your prepared pan now you can use a spatula for this process I'm going to use my hands just because it's easy this sure is not overly hot you know you're not going to burn your fingertips or anything so don't worry about that but in order to prevent my fingers from sticking to this and making a huge mess I'm going to oil my fingertips and gently Pat this out now you don't want to press this really really hard because then you will make you know rock-hard treats you want you know those little pockets in there so be sure and get into the corners so your treats are evenly thick and then you want to go ahead and let this cool for a few minutes before you put your chocolate on top now to prepare the chocolate I'm doing this over a stovetop you can also do this in the microwave that's perfectly fine but stovetop I've just got a pan of some simmering water here and I'm going to put my bowl on top I've got two cups of milk chocolate chocolate chips in here you could also use some nice sweet if you wanted to or dark chocolate would be fine if that's your preference of chocolate and I'm just going to stir this chocolate constantly over that low simmering water but once most of your chocolate is melted you know it's about half way melt or so go ahead and take your bowl off of heat the residual heat will help melt the chocolate and you won't burn it this way so I'll just go ahead and keep stirring it until your chocolate is nice and smooth and you don't have any more chunks in your chocolate and then you can go ahead and pour your melted chocolate over your rice krispies treats again using a spatula I'm just going to smooth my chocolate out all the way to the edges cover the entire top smooth it out make it nice and even because you want an even thickness of chocolate over all of your treats and then you want to set this off either on your counter top or the refrigerator to cool completely in the refrigerator it's going to take about an hour counter top it's going to take a couple hours once they are set up you can go ahead and remove the foil from the sides of your treats this is where you will see if you greased your foil well enough or not I should just come right off and then you can go ahead and cut these into bite-size pieces or bigger pieces if you'd like I like all my pieces nice and uniform I don't like the edge pieces or the corners so I'm going to cut the edges off of my rice krispies treats before I cut them into squares and these edges are there chef's delight you get to have these all to yourself as a little reward for making these so put them in a baggie hide them from everybody else in the family enjoy them because I'm using an 8x8 inch pan I'm just going to cut this into 16 equal pieces go ahead and store these in an airtight container that will guarantee that they stay nice and fresh and soft and sticky be careful though if you put these in the refrigerator they will get hard on you if you let them come up to room temperature again those soften up a bit but yeah there you go soft and sticky and sweet delicious chocolate topped peanut butter rice krispies treats I hope you guys enjoy if you give this recipe a try let me know how you like it down in the comments below thanks so much for watching if you like this video give it a thumbs up I would greatly appreciate it and subscribe for more deliciousness thanks again for watching and we will see you next time [Music]", "ghVgcpLicus": "yes okay it's true i'm 40 years old and i like a children's cereal and a couple weeks ago i made some treats out of rice krispies but i've been stuck in the house for a year i'd like to indulge myself a little bit does that mean this week i'm not allowed to try making some treats out of frosted flakes i hope i don't need to go into hiding over this [Music] hey everybody if you're watching a couple weeks ago i made these really good rice krispies treats with peanut butter and chocolate and they turned out so well it kind of inspired me to see what other sort of no-bake cereal bar treats i could come up with and i was just going through the market and i was like oh let's try some frosted flakes and i didn't think frosted flakes would go with peanut butter that well so i thought let's go back to that sort of traditional marshmallow binding and then i was really curious maybe we'll use white chocolate chips instead of chocolate chips and see how that turns out and when i was shopping for those i found these new espresso chips and i was like okay that could be delicious so i'm gonna try those as well maybe i'm gonna do a swirl between the white chocolate and the espresso and then maybe i'll do another sheet that's half and half just to see how they taste on their own this is all an experiment so we're going to see how this turns out okay just like with the rice krispies treats we're starting out with a half a cup of caro syrup followed by a half a cup of sugar as well [Music] i'm going to add in just a little bit of unsalted butter here to help with sticking [Music] all right now we're going to add in one cup of the marshmallow cream if you're on the east coast you can use the fluff brand which i grew up with but this is what i can get in california [Music] all right starting to melt down okay now it's three cups of frosted flakes [Music] mix this all together maybe we need some more cereal frosted flakes are a lot bigger than uh rice krispie treats so i'm gonna do a little experiment here doesn't look like it'll make too many bars does it do a little bit more for measuring sakes try one more cup across the flakes [Music] okay first up this time you're knocked enough forget to pre-butter these baking pans we want this to pop out of here this time [Music] all right now let's transfer this mixture into the bacon sheet that's not going to make very much huh i think gonna need to make more of this guys i'm gonna try this in a smaller dish so the measurements on this just do not add up to quite the same i told you guys this is an experiment so let's see so maybe if i do a second batch make the portions a little better this one will be the swirl i guess then [Music] use some parchment paper to help myself out here [Music] [Music] all right there we go that's better okay so as i said i think i'm going to try a swirl of the white chocolate chips and the espresso some white chocolate chips down [Music] let's get some of these espresso chips down okay so same as with the rice krispie treats we're gonna pop this under the broiler for about a minute [Music] now let's spread out these chocolates [Music] it smells funny all right well not the self [Music] white chocolate and espresso chips don't melt as nicely as chocolate chips [Music] but you know anyway we'll see what happens let it cool down to room temperature a little bit and we're going to put it in the fridge for like an hour so [Music] all right let's try this again start with some butter this time [Music] sticky in there carrot a syrup of sugar turn the heat off now we're gonna try six cups frosted flakes [Music] i think everything's coated pretty nicely now get this back into a mixing dish [Music] this time i'm gonna try melting the chips in the microwave and see if the melt turns out better i buttered these a little the pyrex a little bit just didn't know if it was going to make a difference but let's see how this turns out pop these in the microwave for 45 seconds [Music] [Applause] [Music] put this in for a little bit longer [Music] now it's a little bit better i'm going under the broiler this is the way to go with the white chocolate on the microwave [Music] all right we'll try pouring this over the top [Music] oh it's so much better it wasn't a whole lot left but spread this out see what happens just use some more chocolate chips [Music] now we're going to melt up those espresso chips under the microwave these go for 45 seconds [Music] for a minute [Music] all right that looks nice so much better now let's pour this on [Music] [Music] oh [Music] all right now we're gonna put both of these pans into the fridge [Music] okay into the fridge as i go okay so it's clear that one of these batches is going to turn out better than the other but this is why i'm experimenting it definitely seems that pre-melting the chips in the microwave is definitely the way to go it just melted a lot nicer and then poured over the top and i was able to spread it nicely this white chocolate and espresso just doesn't seem to react the same way as regular chocolate i think i've seen people in the great british bake off have that same problem with white chocolate so it's not just me anyway we're going to let it all sit in the fridge harden up and then we'll cut them into bars and see how they taste [Music] so it's pretty clear which one looks better this one just the chocolate did not melt correctly it didn't temper correctly just turned into like crumb but it might still taste good but this one even though we didn't have enough chocolate look at that it's like a beautiful temper on the chocolate again that looks really nice all right well we're gonna take them on here cut them up and see how they turned out it turned out all right now we're gonna taste them so you can see we have the first batch the chocolate didn't melt so well but that was the espresso and white chocolate combined and we have just the white chocolate just the espresso and then sort of a black and white version of both i'm going to taste them and see how they come out let's try the ugly one first [Music] oh and that espresso kicks in chewy kind of hardened a lot of room temperature for a little while so you definitely get more of the espresso taste in this than white chocolate now i'm going to go for just the white chocolate by itself the bar itself is not as hard for some reason because we had more corn flakes in these than we did in those first parts that's really good with a white chocolate frosted flakes [Music] all right now we'll try just the [Music] espresso [Music] that's got that espresso kick that's really interesting i don't think we have to taste this because we'll know what it is they just look nice the combo taste is really good though i white chocolate espresso together taste wise this is the best if i could redo this to look like that we'll pre-melting the chips i think this would be the winner well it's always fun to experiment [Music] you", "Ut_4QEFm7R4": "hey everybody I'm the Gulf Coast greeny and welcome back to my kitchen today we're gonna be making a really fun treat for the kids my son loves cocoa pebbles cereal and there was a recipe right on the back of the bag for this I've never made these kind of treats like this before but they're similar to rice krispies treats but they don't use marshmallows it calls for about a tablespoon of butter there's a half a cup of light corn syrup in this bowl now we're going to heat that up until the butter is melted all right that's good at hot now what I'm gonna do so you don't see it and I'm gonna put this 2/3 of a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in here these are just total house Nestle chocolate chips I'm not going to use my good stuff much of your deli not using that for kids snacks with cereal so now we're gonna stir this until the chocolate chips are all melty and smooth excuse a whisk it's not melting the way I want to oh yeah that's much better all right neo it's to me what we're gonna do in this bowl I've got four cups of cocoa pebbles cereal pour it all in there and stir it all together get all of that cereal coated just like you would with rice krispies treats you know the one thing I'm noticing about this is it's not trying to set up on me too fast like that marshmallow does in the rice krispie treats there no it's all coated believed now see it all looks like a big shiny bowl of cooker pills i buttered this dish already butter my hands real good and I'm gonna start smashing this down and you know the reason I'm buttering my hands inside cannot stay in to be sticky I hate it if there you have it these amazing little cocoa pebble treats for the kids my son's gonna be super happy he was reading the back of the cereal this morning and said mommy you think you could make this I said I think I can you know another thing I was thinking too is this would look really good with sprinkles on it if you're doing it for younger children or M&Ms in it or any kind of threat men I didn't do it with this cuz this is what I had I wanted to try it out first but I think that's be a really great idea I hope you all enjoyed this short little video if you're not a subscriber please consider subscribing y'all have a great evening and I'll see you again real soon alright", "g22cZWaQe1s": "you'll need a hundred grams of milk chocolates I prefer milk chocolate bacon use dark or white chocolate and one cup of cocoa clubs or any other chocolate cereal you take it or leave it now you just want to put the chocolate into smaller pieces and melt it in the microwave for one minute I prefer to do in the microwave but you can do on the hop on the stove or wherever you want as long as it's melted now you wanna stir the chocolate until it's smooth at the Coco Pops and Sara until it's thoroughly incorporated grease a plate with some butter or olive oil or vegetable oil and put the mixture on the plate and spread evenly so it's like in so cool like this now put it in the freezer for at least 10 minutes so it can Harden and then you're done click to see my last video which is a vlaka toxin strain the world's biggest slush don't want you believing you take it or leave it", "gY5PGDzvpJs": "[Music] what's up guys welcome to another episode of world you smokes today we're making cereal bars we're gonna take an eighth of weed and we're gonna turn into edibles so stay tuned stay lifted and get high [Music] [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] you all right here we go so the method that I mentioned earlier and the reason why you might need two pots is called we're gonna do what is called the diet double boiler method so you need a smaller pot with the top that fits within the bigger pot water goes in the bigger pot yes I have to do this yes I know don't I usually don't do cooking videos because my house is usually a mess I work two jobs those kind of hearts it's in helping cleaning dishes [ __ ] what you want to do is you want to wait for the water to come to a boil and when it's boiling we're gonna drop this bad boy in just like that so I stay submerged let's fill it on on the edge right there you see yeah it's gonna boil right around the bottom I might even add a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] ooh [Applause] [Music] why [Music] [Music] [Music] to the line [Music] just be hot enough to stay melted but not hot enough to get sticky where you're constantly stirring it so it makes it a lot easier also if you have one of these pans that locks and unlocks these are great because we're gonna first gonna forcibly keep it kind of close just keep it warm but then once it gets warm enough and boiling we're gonna open it up and maybe even take it off you just want to see a boil but for now let's just give it a second a little warm up and we'll get right back to it all right so we're gonna be using like you know I'd say a 75% full bag of marshmallows not a full bag but just it's about 75% of these smaller eight bags this one in particular is I Tory I don't know maybe 12 ounces or something and a full slipper butter along with two scoops of coconut oil 2 big tablespoons of it that way should have enough butter and oil liquid to go along with these marshmallows and you're gonna see the process great looks like our water is boiling as you can tell gets pretty hot so we're gonna grab our other pant set it on down in there there you go Dan we'll grab a regular stick of butter and because I am quarantine and just leaving my only stick of butter that I got I'm gonna let that melt down before I add the additional coconut oil that I may use the fact that private should have made it with coconut oil but I like butter and in my edibles I like the flavor of butter more so for all your coconut oil fanatics so I could get the best of both worlds another that's going and started to melt a little got my coconut oil this one I've had before so grab a spoon boom and another spoonful boom people love that [ __ ] yeah and there's just stir it up and I actually let it all dissipate and to basically clear liquid before I put anything else in you can just stir it up for another couple of minutes and we'll be right back one this is nice and ready all right now that we're here what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just the heat from directly halfway to about 25% you know we're at 50 now I'm just doing 25% the reason for is when we go to cover this it's gone this is actually gonna become more like a convection oven just like your regular oven down here and it's actually gonna enclose everything and it will not only D carb your weave but also cook it within the butter / coconut oil make sure we got here and that's how this method is effective and how it D carbs are we and the Scientifics behind it if you do not set your top on you're not deke are being your weed and your [ __ ] up so make sure you have a top all right the other thing that's important is obviously the bud and make sure you have your button nice and fine like we do I like to grind my knob but you can do whatever hand grinding is just fine go ahead and make sure you get all of it there you go and you're gonna stir it up whoo darlin stir it up mm-hmm you can instantly tell that it's turned green look at that quite gorgeous so this is like I said this is a one bug that was completely covered with high columns and very very high quality so this is gonna make us some really strong edibles some people will say you gotta take the top foam off but when it comes to edibles you want to keep everything you have because you know every little bit counts and that's just wasteful man you won't see that in the final product anyways when you bake and make edibles with this so don't worry about that foam but as mentioned earlier most important thing is once you give it a couple stores cover it up that bad boy and make sure that it's locked boom and that's gonna sit there for 45 to an hour it could be even less some people like to do 30 minutes but when I'm doing in double boiler method I find out that it's a little bit longer than a convex oven which is 30 minutes so if you do it's 45 minutes to 50 you're probably good that's like that's mine that's where I kind of pull it right up around 50 55 you know in the middle of those two numbers but you'll be fine regardless because it's only heating this bad boy up at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and it does tend to keep a very consistent boil because of the water and the hot water disperses in general cool stay tuned alright now that we added some water we gotta let it come back to a boil but I'd say you can start scooping out some of this foam if you prefer I am we're just gonna toss it on out it's not that much foam but I like to really really be careful skimming it so that I only get the phone and none of the oil or none of the butter just like that and the slower you are at doing this the easier and better cleaner butter you're gonna have most of the bog should still be on the bottom as you can tell you'd see it right in there so don't worry if you skip a couple Lisa but it's not gonna be the end then there I'm just gonna keep it stern keep it boiling and we got another 30 minutes left on the clock so this is a good half way check point something we should all check on halfway and just go ahead and let it get back to it everything is looking pretty de card and real nice and light green in color remember that butter color but now it's just that green color that's what you want we're gonna start adding a marshmallow minis and I just do a little bit at a time you will say you know half a bag for this mod and pull back for that amount but what I notice is most of those people are just kind of guesstimating and it doesn't always work out that well for you so if you do it hand by hand and you slowly start stirring them into they melt you're gonna know exactly how much you'll need and you'll always have enough marshmallows to make this stuff don't worry and enough butter you know we usually do your mom one stick of butter plus those two extra scoops is way more than what's recommended for a regular cereal bar recipe and the reason why you do that is because we're stretching our eighth across an entire pan you know maybe if you're putting it in like 8 pounds worth of weed or like a kewpie or a couple of ounces at least you know then you have to start thinking about you know making it really concentrated because that's just ridiculous but if you keep it within normal measurements for regular people especially during these times of quarantine you know when none of us are really smoking like very regularly smoking I'm just trying to conserve my stuff this is a great way of doing it and another thing about it is edibles are just a great way of not you know coughing and [ __ ] and so if you're feeling sick and you're starting getting like fem onea which is the Phoenix lands you in the hospital of this coronavirus is most people give ammonia first and then they end up in the hospital you better start making edibles this is saving lives people all right out of all those are the way to go especially during the time of sickness during the time of this kind of [ __ ] like I know some older people and they don't really smoke they got kids they can't be out there but they'll buy they'll buy a cereal bar they'll buy a brownie you know don't take out like a three pack of cookies wrapped up that's all I'm saying you got to find the right customer for the right product I like to get all the marshmallows covered in this juice before they start blending in together see how they're finally starting this kind of mushed together well I always stirred so that they all get a good covering of this butter / oil now we're still gonna add a lot more of these marshmallows in there to get the right kind of consistency however this is a great start you know let it melt together close it up for a little bit just let it cut down just a little bit and maybe in like five minutes we're gonna add a little bit more so give us five minutes and we'll be right back oh yeah that's looking pretty good pretty sticky but there as you can tell there's still a lot of liquid underneath so we're gonna actually have to add more marshmallows to this and that's kind of how you can base it is as you start see underneath how much butter and oil is left excuse me I just ripped a huge bond and it's coming back on me but yeah as you stir you can see how much oil and butter is left which is a good way of telling how much you might have to add so as you can tell I told you this entire bag was gonna be too much maybe like right in right in that pocket it's gonna be okay whoops get that out again you wanna keep stirring this so that there's a lot of equal disbursement among your your marshmallow mix this is after all what is medicated it's not gonna be the cereal itself it's just gonna be this so you want to make sure that it says well mix and as even in the dispersed as possible well I'm not over over spilling it who that bomb oh yeah you just want to make sure your Stern they're still actually a pretty good access mom of butter so I have to add another handful at least yeah I'd say that's about two small tiny handfuls you write you rather unloaded and overloaded every time I tell those people all the time and you want to get that perfect perfect marshmallow fluff out of this if you undercook it with all this it's not gonna come out if you don't keep stirring it in making it more and more consistent it's not gonna come out and if you just sit around it's gonna burn man so you got to keep your eyes on it you gotta every five minutes you gotta check on it you know and here I'm doing nice little stir as you can see the viscosity is definitely a lot higher it's becoming a lot more creamier and it's just starting to look great it's even got a nice little green tint for all you stoners out there now you could have strained this and not have any of the wheat particles in there but I could give a [ __ ] glass I like my out of Oz taste in my buds so I just keep them tasting like bud and that's just mean all right so we're gonna cover that up five minutes we'll take a look again whoops and this ought to be the last time we do this so well good thing I had a cover when it dropped look at that perfect sure everything is good we'll walk away we got just enough marshmallows in case we need them I actually started eating them back that's where they're even fool same thing with this I had a bowl of it pretty good I love Captain Crunch can't complain so I think this combination is gonna be great you want this is so little let's just toss it all and then come back in five minutes in college the next step is where all the fun begins boom all right looking pretty good oh yeah the whole thing now it's more or less this right here which is what you want like that account nice that looks right there and not only did you just go from stop one you just did step one two and three we D carved our weed we put our weed in some sort of butter or oil and we also created the first step to our next recipe so feel good give yourself a pat on the back this is the fastest way to make cereal bars and the tastiest way to make cereal bars now that this is done we're gonna have two nice lis mix it all in one here and the reason why I keep my water running is because I'm gonna put it right back in here and I'm gonna keep it going so that this stay is a good consistency and doesn't turn out on us while we're you know spinning our actual making our actual bars right here I like to use a spoon because that does actually y'all it does a pretty good job at mixing everything together to give it a equal mix right now it's it's hot and it's wet so it's actually really easy to do this but once it gets drier it gets harder harder so you may want to start spilling it over onto your pan just like that and then get the next part going oh yeah stand strengthen up we're just gonna fill this pan in and using our spatula which we can kind of create a nice flat surface we're gonna stretch these out a little bit there we go now again if you wanted to use a 4x4 pan or double up this recipe and use an 8x8 pan that's a baking brownie baking dish pan it's gonna give you a nice thick piece like you see in other places you more than welcome to do that but I personally I like mine thinner I like they're just easier to eat easier faster and you might to you know try this recipe and I urge you you might see for yourself it's just it's just a nice little quick snack I don't sell them for as much some other people I usually do like you know like two pieces for ten maybe three pieces for ten bucks depending how much you put in there again it's audible so you're not really ever gonna make your money back on on it we're not much if you are so it's always just something something more of like a treat to yourself and the treat for people that that are around you that are cool so I'm gonna let that keep burnin see we may actually need to add shoulda maybe added a little bit more marshmallow but that's okay pour it on all this got to get rid of all of it and now that this is all done we're gonna turn this off let that sit and mix up all this if you have a bigger mixing pan I highly recommend that you do it all the mixing pans so it's more even but I just don't have a big enough mixing bowl yeah I'd like to get one of those big KitchenAid things that has like ah you know that like spins mixes the ship for you but right now those are pretty expensive and I'm not much of a cook yeah I'm just getting better with every every year as a time use you know as you get older you just start cooking and I think most people like in their twenties tend to go out tend to on a date and that's what it is the dating scene makes you go out and makes you like go to restaurants restaurant it's kind of nice with your significant other once you get older man it's always fun to get better at cooking at your own place and being your own man it's nice it really does give you a different kind of sense of it's like growing your own because you have different sense of self sustainability also nice work a little way to make a little cash if you're into that nice little way of making some friends happy making some older people happy not everyone likes to smoke weed man but everyone loves edible crazy and see I like that sprinkle of fact that you can't win crush them up I do that with all my out of o stereos I know some people look at me like I'm crazy but it gives it a good consistency you know take some of those throw over here where it needs to be so it looks like we're not even gonna get a full pan out of this no just try and keep everything leveled in you don't get the corners nice and good one side seems a little bit thicker than the other side but that's okay you almost got a full pan maybe next time we'll get to two boxes of cereal so we can get this the rest of this filled in the other cereals fill it in and just kind of depends on the texture and consistency of the cereals I didn't know that these Captain Crunch weren't gonna fill in the full pan but that's pretty good telling you guys you just want to keep it pretty flat put this edge just how I'm doing here and as you can tell as everything is forming to place it's really looking pretty solid I would say that's great so the next and final move is you got to actually take this and whoop almost fell over got to walk over and put it in the fridge now through wondering why my fridge is all empty it's because I didn't really listen about the quarantine lockdown so I got quarantined with no I didn't go grocery shopping or none of that [ __ ] so I'm just eating now what I have and I'm doing just fine I'm linking through another week don't worry about me just yeah I got a lot more frozen food than I do non frozen so just letting you guys know no worries anyways in about 30 minutes to an hour I'd say that should be done and we can have our first fate taste test alright here's the finished product after I ate a couple pieces of course but look at that goodness [Music] look at that beautiful color alright guys and we're back with our delicious Oh cereal bars and look how good these came out this is why I like mine thinner see when they're thin they're way more easily biteable they're kind of grier you know mmm telling you guys con candy flavored cereal there's a way to go this is just like handy it's a nice way of extending the life of your weed sometimes what you'll find is they'll be a little bit of them kind of butter your / sticky marshmallow stuff on the edges so once you were done with all this make sure to eat all that up to scratch out the sides take a spoon punch it down because there's a lot of THC in the corners that you won't be able to get to right away other than that I hope you guys have fun watching I hope you guys had fun cooking with me this is gonna be a new series but maybe we'll keep it going because I'm a pretty good cook for those who know me I make a lot of edibles I love eating weed so I'm thinking about just trying something different and I appreciate you guys watching along and as always stay lifted this world your smokes my [Music]", "NQVAdTnK27s": "hi this is Diane love to bake and what we're going to make our actually cereal treats and you can use really any flavor or any type of cereal that you want but I'm going to be actually using these Franken berry cereal this is out for a limited time only but there's lucky charms there's generic brands that have the sweetened cereal with marshmallows in it too so you'll need actually six cups of the sweetened cereal your raw brand or whatever and you're going to start off with four tablespoons of butter give your pan hi so that I can get started quickly through the video so it's a little bit little bit hi there so we're going to put your mat down I just wanted to get that butter going the next thing that we're going to be putting in is actually 10 ounces of marshmallows and what I would suggest is put in one extra cup of the marshmallows in the butter they're just the bag of marshmallows put in 10 ounces plus 1 1 cup and then just start melting these marshmallows in your pan with the with the butter and that shouldn't take you too long and again you don't want the temperature too high because you don't you know you don't want to burn them what I find is I actually leave sometimes the marshmallows intact a little bit not completely melted so it comes out kind of a little bit chunky it just looks a little bit better around these on the cereal treats so that's I'm melting and coming along quite nicely as you can see and you know yourself if you've made these treats and so many of us made these treats for years and years we're just going to wait for that to melt and then we're going to just put them in the marshmallows and take the take it off the heat and then now we're just going to combine them now you're going to need a 13 x nine pan and it is best if you go ahead and you spray your pan with them with an oil spray or that type of thing and I'm going to quickly do mine with a little butter spray your 13 by 9 you can put them in any type of container that you prefer any shape just lower this a little bit here all right and now I'm just going to start putting in that smell material that was six cups i turn the heat off the stove and then just start putting to rest of it yet but I like to do is after right campus in the 13 by 9 p.m. I go ahead and I melt actually 16 ounces of chocolate with one tablespoon of shortening in my microwave and then what I like to do is actually you can pour the chocolate over the treats or you can drizzle them you can wait till they set up cut them and then dip them in chocolate it's really up to you what you want to do but let's pour this into the pan get all those a little better yeah and these stay good for you for about a week keep them in a nice closed container or a cook a nice ziploc bag that type of thing and they will keep up for for a week and then I'm just going to smooth these out into the pan try to level them off even them out a little bit but sometimes even spray the back of my spoon a little bit with my spray and that helps to Pat it down into your pan like I said I really don't melt the marshmallow sometimes all the way down because I like them to look chunky in there okay alright so those are in the pan and a state school you know you can press them down with your with your clean pants that type of thing and I have some chocolate here melted as i said i did one pound and 1 tablespoon of shortening and then like I said you can just go ahead and you can numb drizzle chocolate over the top or you can as I said cut them and then just dip them in there but I'm going to use up all the chocolate here and drizzle it over the top and you can put it in the refrigerator to set them up a little bit faster outside and just put them in your fridge till the hard enough that you can cut them and I have some to show you and here they are so you've got your sweetened cereal with your drizzle chocolate or you can cut them and then just cut them in squares or any shape and then just get them in the chocolate that type of thing so what a quick and easy recipe using your sweetened cereal with marshmallows and some chocolate

great things about this i love rice krispies and i'm becoming a massive fan of white chocolate combine them cereal white chocolate yeah i'm pretty sure i'm gonna like it let's check it out well not much to look at so far but let's pour a bowl as i said it's not a whole lot to look at just looking like a slightly glazed rice krispie but really what did you expect it kinda has a slight vanilla smell really hoping it captures a little bit of that white chocolate probably just gonna be rice krispies with a sweet vanilla taste but hey i'm down with rice krispies let's try it believe it or not it kinda has like a rice krispies treat taste nice vanilla taste a nice sweetness and i'm a fan of an og cereal like rice krispies so i like it i need to eat a million i swear it's almost marshmallowy silver i'm down with it let's add a little bit of the white you hear that i'm pretty sure that's a copyright as it all crispy cereal we gotta move pretty quick but the smell is definitely increasing and has that classic crackle let's try it let's see if it tastes more like a white chocolate let's do it really far back i get white chocolate but i mostly just get sweet vanilla that's not a bad thing it tastes good milk and whites here if you guys like vanilla flavor things and rice krispies you're going to be down what does ron think of the european white cocoa crispies everything you love about rice krispies but i almost love marshmallow week on a vibe ron's giving this one 8.5 out of 10. this is a solid solid cereal sorry guys you can't get this in canada it was said to me from spain

this recipe submitted by Allrecipes member she cooks too as one member named Erin says the addition of vanilla extract just really takes these from good to young to get started code a 9 by 13 inch pan with nonstick spray next add three tablespoons of butter to a large saucepan over low heat when it's melted add one teaspoon of vanilla and four cups of mini marshmallows melt the marshmallows into the butter stirring constantly off heat add four cups of crisp rice cereal and stir until it's evenly coated [Music] working quickly pour the cereal mixture into the prepared pan before it starts to harden using a sheet of waxed paper press it down flat and evenly into the pan you want to make bars dense enough that they hold their shape and stay moist once cut Allrecipes member danno notes that the recipe doubles nicely using the same pan if you prefer extra thick bars let this set for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature before cutting into squares [Music] of course you can always get creative by adding candy coated chocolates chocolate chips or nuts to the original recipe either way marshmallow crispy bars are sure to bring out the kid in you [Music]", "WlG50z9LwXQ": "what's up hi uh this is an intro to episode 4 of breakfast with cereal with sierra and brody myself that was one of the notes we got in our forums what is that uh one specific person wanted uh more of an intro from us it doesn't matter i don't need to call them out okay okay don't call me hi i wanna this is our intro this is our introduction welcome to our podcast thank you acid what about breakfast with cereal i need i need jeremy singing that we do need that professionally done any volunteers that would be great jeremy i'll make your next emote for you if you uh sing that song for us how was that how's that for a trade-off is this a business deal happening right now on episode four episode four okay so episode four means it's back to my turn to um come up with the guidelines and questions and things for us that will take us through this episode sounds good yay um so i guess what we're gonna start off with um is such a reoccurring a game of hypotheticals the thing i decided we should discuss okay uh you will go to sleep tonight and when you wake up tomorrow you will have a tail i will have a couch you will have a tail 100 yes okay but you get to choose what animal tail it is and it's whatever you choose before you go to sleep or whatever okay so i don't know why i'm making it so involved like there's this whole process but anyways no this is really good so yeah what animal would you choose to base your tail on like i want a zebra tail that's useless and does nothing or do you want a monkey tail am i the only tale of a bird am i the only one having a tail or does everyone else in the world also have a jail everyone will get tails oh you just you just get to pick what time see that makes me feel so much better because at first i'm like i want like a tiny little like turtle tail or something i can hide oh that'd be weird and gross yeah if i was gonna be the only one with a tail i think i'd have like a cola oh i'd want like a big old dinosaur tail oh okay chunky like i actually have a tail no i'd be so good because there aren't you know people whose like coccyx flails out on accident like just through whatever and like at the end of your tailbone like instead of curling in a little bit through whatever reason it points out and they have like a weird little nubbin that pokes through so when you look at guinness book of world records from 2005. no it looks i mean it's fine anyway i'm not i'm not shaming people who have tails uh i support all furries oh don't say that we're not propharia [Applause] of a bird tail really some kinds of feathers that would be cool first thought i was like monkey tail some type of monkey jail because those like help help them balance and things like that yeah so very useful as a utility yeah those are probably the tales i hear the most about um like actually helping some like doing stuff yeah yeah the only thing with that then would be like how big it would be in correlation because monkeytails are like the length of them if they're actually useful for them so it would be the length of me just a pow i mean you'd have to think so what would it wouldn't it like do a little curl up thing sure yeah i'm okay with that i mean this isn't boots the monkey we're talking about we're talking about actual what if i want it to be well it's not your hypothetical i don't think i don't think uh wow fake characters i don't know because and then how strong would it really be because yeah monkeys can hold themselves up by it but monkeys are like 15 pounds and four pounds of it is their tail well one minute if if the length goes by your bot your own body then wouldn't it that like strikes two i can deadlift if i shut down that's true dude you're gonna bulk up your tail yeah exactly i have like leg day and tail day yeah i don't know i think i would want something that is something i'd be cool showing off and not feel weird about yeah i guess that makes sense um so why was your first thought bird bird too i think it would act like a piece of clothing although if i got you know colors and i kept it nice or whatever it would just be oh my gosh i'm sorry but i can't i can't like just picture like you would have feathers i think so but nowhere else on your body no oh that is another another thing that is possible is just how gross if it was like a pig's tail you know it's all just yeah skin but yeah let's not talk about that that's why i almost didn't ask this question but i thought we would keep it funny yeah no i think uh i think i i'm choosing my answer lock it in monkey tail nice yeah pretty sure i think that would work we've got our tails decided yep my next question then uh would be what theme song what would be your theme song i guess and uh just to narrow it down a bit i specifically said what would your theme song be if you had to pick like a nintendo or video game soundtrack song all right um so what was your first thought okay so my first thought was of course it was uh delfino plaza mario sunshine i mean come on i love that song but then i'm thinking i'm like i don't know if that feels like my theme song like it's a great song i love it but i don't i'm not so sure it's like something that like yeah when you first meet me that's playing right i get that and i mean it's very easy to just be like animal crossing oh yeah for sure able sisters yeah or yeah any wrestling song yeah i i like crossing song from the gamecube that's like any time of day almost probably and new horizons honestly but like it's just such a it's just such peaceful music that i mean it was made to be listened to for an hour at a time so only one well i mean yeah in the game yeah oh yeah yeah i was like i i can sit and play animal crossing for more than the soundtrack 3 p.m was made to be that's all i'm saying i also along with animal crossing thought of kkk slider oh okay slider songs would be great right but then i was like i love the mama crossing song bubble gum oh i don't know i don't know why you don't but again i don't think it's like a theme song for me i don't see it yeah and then i can't think of the kk slider song now that i like so much was it kk swing i don't know i don't remember but i remember the song i just don't remember the name [Music] no i can't i also like animal crossing island night tour or whatever it's called right the one you've saved yeah yeah i don't know that i'll be able to um play music yeah probably not during this so well maybe a little like because for this uh question um it'd be hard to think of just a ton on the spot so we listened to um some before this to get like an idea of what we wanted or what our answer would be and so i have one but again i feel like if i just say it you won't like right yeah i'll try to intersperse clips like that we'll see can i just can i just play it for my phone right now no that'll sound worse so if we get taken down i'll you know put another episode up with just our audio yes that'll be fine kk cruising [Music] whistling when we listen to the playlist of you know nintendo songs i liked flower garden yoshi island yeah a lot and i thought like it just sounds nice and it sounds like something that like isn't already like i think that is the perfect song for your profile picture that you have right now like your your the one you got from the app the um hand-drawn discord icon yeah i think that's perfect for that and it fits that like one-to-one i get it i get it and i also love it like wii sports smash ultimate version yeah because i was like i love because when you played that i was like okay this kind of those kind of goes off but again it's not like a theme song like it's just like something that sounds good right and i guess too i was also thinking i mean i keep saying theme song i'm thinking more of like if your show was a sitcom what would your intro song yeah yeah you know not like your background whatever no and for that i think wii sports would be funny to have just you and your friends turning to the camera and showing your name for wii sports music but could i also do um the like sound effect of uh wii sports resort i believe it is with the sword fighting and just yes yeah that could be included i would like that i also think with wii sports right that could easily be put to words with yeah that's a good one i also love that including interspersed as well all these sound effects included if your show was a if your life was a sitcom would it get renewed for a second season there's a big a big difference well what's your story arc b then i don't i don't know trying to beat your pb right now and and bench or squats or something deadlift no i don't know what it would be maybe like the store oh oh actually you're gonna hear something funny that kind of has to do with that is bailey and i were thinking of funny names for a podcast with me and bailey and this is some of the ones we came up with um hold on it's loading first of all i said knee slappers okay like you know when you fought the funny thing she said the inside scooped with cereal and i was like oh that's good i was like breakfast with basil cereal with faith you know because that's her thing she said frosted cereal i was like uh she said cakes and giggles that's a good one she's said daughter jokes which i really like um i said daughter jokes silly stories from alaskan and a hoosier except yeah it's just funny and then she goes um anxious autistic and depressed a gen z story i'm not autistic by the way i don't know we were neither his baby a girl wait my story arc right now would be like finishing high school isn't really a big part of your life you're just kind of like yep it's there yeah most exciting thing in my life right now is that i finished 25 of high school i would say your weightlifting stuff is more exciting than that i guess that is yeah it's true yeah but again i don't feel like it's a whole story artwork well sure but whatever how was your story right now um trying to buy a house probably yeah that was good episode one we filed taxes episode two we get the return back and uh wait three months for it to be in our bank oh it's high it's 3 14. nice happy pride oh oh my gosh today is uh today's uh equal pay day really yeah so you know i thought you were going to say peyton manning's birthday is it it is it's the only thing i knew today see that's what's wrong there's too many national holidays okay national days i should say yeah i was like it's not like a holiday thing it's just equal pay day so you know can't wait to make a 82 cents for every dollar i've never heard that and i pay attention to like stuff never hurt what equal pay day yeah if you look on twitter twitter twitter look on twitter right now it's like trending probably uh no as i was on twitter right before we went live it was not it was not on there uh number one equal payday i okay i seriously looked at it less than an hour ago and it wasn't up uh listener i looked into number one politics trending equal payday during women's history month march 24th is equal payday and is dedicated to raising social awareness on the gender wage gap and two it's um i'm pretty sure number one was like sydney powell or something no it's some girl right now and then number three is santa montana because hannah montana was training yeah there are too many national days yeah 7 11 should have should be the national you know slurpy day that's that makes sense which is mill's birthday you think that's the only the only national day that needs to be yeah yeah maybe a couple others i think i i kind of like like national days or whatever because i think it's like kind of kind of funny there should be more silly ones and less serious ones yeah but if you try to do silly ones it'll be like you know 4 30 o'clock 4 30 o'clock 4 30 news and the the newscasters are being like guys it's a national telegraph yeah but i mean like national like you're not like the silly days at school yeah national crazy hair day like that's funny and that's one of the craziest yes and i want everyone when you go out to have crazy yes okay i kind of get that opportunity yes an actual yeah well no there are too many problems that would come with an actual opposite date oh yeah actually there should be a national uh breakfast for dinner today i'm sure there already is but i mean things that should just just just be yeah like if i'm going to wings etc for dinner okay i want to show up and they'd be like hey here's chicken wings and pancakes you know because it's whatever mm-hmm i'm good with that yeah i like it yeah more silly holidays i'm all for it less weird serious holidays yeah you know causes are great well this summer's nice let's we want breakfast for dinner day last breakfast for dinner day i gave you my heart i love it uh speaking of holidays yes kind of not at all this is the cicada year oh happy saluta here for our area i think so the map i saw um was most of indiana right lovely but they showed up by county and i'm like i guess 99 sure that cicadas don't abide by county lines for where they breed you know maybe i'm wrong and they're super respectful nowadays they actually go they have their own street addresses and they're like they're little bros yeah yeah but it showed um they don't they don't cross state lines right it showed elkhart and st joe um were this year the 2021. i don't know and but just north like cass county and and such and um oh what is it porter county which is out in valpo and stuff yeah uh those were 2024. and cicadas have 17-year cycles oh i hate you know there are others with shorter ones and that's why they're always around but this is supposed to be like the big one yeah we had to research mostly those ones because we didn't understand that because we're like no we have cicadas every year what do you mean they're 17. right right and it's like there are multiple broods which is just a disgusting word to be associated with at all yeah yeah i didn't know the definition of that before we had to learn about us well would it have to we were curious because they're annoying so yeah actually it probably came up because bailey had never heard of cicada before and she was like that's true what is this sound they're yeah they're very much in the midwest too um which i learned uh the article said they're not attracted to people or moving things they're attracted to sounds interesting so i don't know i can't remember enough 17 years to go to think if it was i did not understand i did not understand enough to 17 years ago i don't remember 17 years ago well enough to like remember if cicadas were a problem i'm sorry i probably messed it up no i think my the processing part of my ears and brain turned off for a moment i had to tell the dad my art my boss that i could not teach people certain things and if it's just our team of three four five people i can do that i can make that work but words don't come out of my brain properly enough to teach random employees of other businesses how to do things like online and such yeah you're good at explaining things to me though like when i when it's one-on-one and i can get a sense of what you're picking up on and not right i can try but even then it's like a whole classroom right want to go to a business and have eight people learn this thing that i know yeah and even then with you uh heck drew or tyler have to explain things a third time okay that's true tyler's good with that since he was a teacher tyler's tyler is very good at being a teacher maybe he can teach us more about cicada yeah maybe because i literally failed would have failed this class like the other year without him so i remember math in sixth grade when we were just learning the very basics of like pre-algebra and stuff for whatever reason with that sixth grade teacher is like one of my favorites too but she could not make pre-algebra click for about six or seven of us weird and she had a classroom helper which was just some kid from the high school that you know would come down for an hour yeah well he explained it to us somehow in a way that according to the teacher was the exact way she explained it but it just clicked for all of us yeah and we were like oh this is easy and she was so mad because she's like been trying for like hours and she's like losing yeah and then this kid comes in exactly yeah and probably says something completely wrong but it clicked for us right yeah so teaching is is not anything i ever want to do no matter what it's about i i am like i am passionate about a lot of things and i like to share my passion i do not like to teach things to others i don't think i have patience to ever teach anyone anything ever like i would just be like why are you getting it already you know come on it's yeah but again i don't know enough to even teach someone like i can teach you how to tie your shoes baby just watch like i don't even have anything to teach people right i mean there are certain things i'll walk you through i walked you through march madness practice like four years ago true to the point where you're like oh march madness time i know i know how to do this let me pick this and this true speaking of i should check on my thing because i actually have it in a couple days uh it's been terrible for me oh no yeah i have um one bracket i have two brackets one where gonzaga beats illinois in the championship oh okay illinois get beat by loyola i have a second bracket where loyola beat illinois and is now gonna beat gonzaga in the championship okay so it's just the one that i entered all groups in was the long one yeah iowa lost which oh i had to tell dad not to pick byu as his first pick and he's like well their stats are good because he read it on the app i guess he's like dad they're gonna lose round one okay and they lost around my two right now that are like that i've gotten wrong in the sweet 16 are i said iowa but it's oregon and i said ohio state but it's oral roberts yeah that was a huge upset yeah that there's no way they're gonna be our our kansas arkansas right i don't think so i don't think they've played that good either i just think ohio state played sloppy i also think um oregon had um a bye week basically because bcu had positive covet test so they just break so oregon didn't play a game before they played um iowa oh especially when you play you have one break of a like one day break oh so they played two games iowa that was iowa's second game and oregon's first game within four-day within two days four days yeah my percentage is 73. that's good okay cool i'm not doing good what's funny is in our work bracket chelsea who is like i don't know what's going on i'm probably gonna lose this whole thing is winning by like nine points or something like she is way better than anyone else so that's always how it is though it really is like 60 coin flips and forty percent knowledge i also don't really have much money for basketball at all so that's why i like being like oh yeah i'm actually doing okay because there's no reason for me to be doing okay like i don't i don't follow the vlog that much you read the little blurb maybe and then you flip a coin yeah maybe do i look glowy today we're in a very shadowed place i can't really tell because me and bailey did these shock things you put a needle in your face no like a drink i got my vaccine no no like a little drink thing it had like vinegar apple cider vinegar and like stuff like that and you and you look beautiful okay he's trying to escape what if it's like because he has some mission like in cats and uh cats first wait cats and dogs what's it called i just hate that you reminded me of the existence of cats and dogs it's a great movie and um i think they're making another one or unless that was just a rumor right here i hope not could be a rumor because a lot of people love that movie so it could be just like you know the last talking cat movie was kevin spacey so let's just keep away from all sorts of that yes yeah cats and dogs was terrible it just was not fun i still don't understand how fair life is still oh no i don't either i still don't understand how you told me you were going to make me that shirt that i love from from sea world from when i was like four you know mom threw it away because it didn't fit me and you still have it maybe for me so i can have another one i there are things that i will do when i am like in the moment like i need something to do i want to do something creative and that should be at the top of your list yeah i just forget about it and i i don't know it's fine i can oh we should talk about um what our merchandise i am i am stopping stuff with redbubble i've been selling you know my designs and stuff through them for a while yeah and i finally hit the point where i'm just gonna stop all together especially he's gonna stop recommending it i might leave stuff up but it's not just one thing it's it's multiple things time and time again but prints come out wrong and weird and they just don't care and send it off i got a sweater like a crew neck with our breakfast with cereal logo on it and when it arrived the white was like dark dingy gray and none of the colors were right it just looked like it had been faded like sat in the sun and faded forever yeah it looks like a vintage like this is supposed to be worn out like like an old like fan t shirt or something it just does not look right and it's faded um you know they always smell like vinegar because they have to vinegar wash it it's part of their thing so i'm used to that some people complain about that but yeah it's just disappointing and then to have their legal department write me multiple times because they just don't want to deal with things so the only things that sell are stuff that's barely skirting around um you know copyright laws and stuff yeah but when something is truly a parody and should be protected it doesn't count so all of it's just annoying and i think what we'll do um is if enough people are interested i'll just buy stuff directly through custom ink which i've also used before for work stuff and for um melon had stuff back in the day but i'll just have a sign up sheet basically that says hey i want one t-shirt we want three t-shirts whatever it is they'll all look the same but you can order whatever size you want um and we'll pick a color i don't know um embroidered hats i'll make a new logo specifically for embroidered hats maybe and with stuff like that i think you only need to order a batch of um you can buy individually but five will start to get you that lower five to seven will usually start to get you that lower price so right all we need is just people to say hey i am interested in buying this um in the price range you know yeah because that does matter because they have stinkin north face jackets that you can embroider for 120 or something like that too but don't want that okay is there anything else you want to talk about we do get comments that our episodes are a little long so i know which i was like no i wasn't offended it's a joke i know and lately i've been listening to podcasts that are like almost two hours long yeah i guess it depends so some but sometimes i do like a quick like 30 minute 45 minute podcast yeah i like i like shorter videos sometimes it just depends so uh yeah give us feedback um we really appreciate everyone that's filling out a form and stuff too yeah for sure um we'll get through some more episodes and hopefully get more regular at this and then we'll be able to um did you guess yeah and let you know uh i will be doing that too yeah that sounds good to me interesting stuff now we need an outro um i don't know what was it we said last time that was our new outro i forget i forget too it was just something i said off the top of my head i we should do a whole podcast over i can't no how about you look like a southern accent like a sweet little like southern accent i could do a southern one i think if i could i don't know if i could last that long i wanted my star wars character to have a southern draw for a while and i didn't go through with it some cats get into the cat food cat why didn't you go through with it i think i would have enjoyed that hearing you talk like this with a southern accent yeah we'll see anyway thank you guys for listening hope you enjoyed we'll be back with more next time on breakfast with cereal bye go safe square button i know that now", "1LEiZcXbr6E": "hi guys welcome to Cheryl some cooking so let's get started welcome to Cheryl's home cooking and today what I'm going to show you is my fruit loop crispy treats they're really really good so let's get started so I have eight cups of fruit loops in a bowl I have my baking dish that I sprayed with cooking spray I'll place three tablespoons of butter in my pot I'll lower it down to medium-low to the butter I'll be adding in ten ounces of the mini marshmallows you want to mix it quick because you don't want it to burn you want to melt the marshmallows till it's nice and creamy and for the fruit loops I picked up the fruit loops with marshmallows so just keep stirring it it's almost melted all right that's nice melted now I'll turn my burner off now let the marshmallow is melted good and the butter is melted into the marshmallows I'll take my 8 cups of fruit loops and like I said I picked up the fruit loops with the marshmallows you want to mix it quickly this is going to be so good all righty now you can use a spatula or I put on some gloves I'll take the mixture put it into my grease pan I find it to be easier with this spoon and a spatula rather than the gloves it was sticking too much to the gloves I figured it would be easier but it's not so you just want to flatten it all down make it even once it's cool then I'll cut it into squares now that I flattened it all down I'll take a cup of white moreso smelt them and then I'll drizzle it all on top so I placed the one cup of plate morsels in my microwave I'll melt it down and once it's done that's not drizzle at all on the top now I'll go check on the morsels now the white morsels have melted I'll just take it you know kind of drizzling it on [Music] take it off the spoon and I'm using my knife I'm actually spreading it rather than drizzling yet this is going to be really good this way here everyone gets a piece of the fruit loop crispy treats with white chocolate on it so now I'll place this off to the side I want the white chocolate to harden up on the fruit loops and I want the fruit loops to get nice and firm before I slice them into squares now that the fruit loops have firmed up and the chocolate has firmed I'll slice them into squares and give them a try I'll cut a piece oh yeah look at that now look at how good that looks you see the white chocolate on top and the fruit loops all stuck together with the marshmallow so now I'll give it a try so I'll take a bite mmm-hmm so good nice and crispy in that white chocolate on top mm-hmm really really good I highly recommend making each for the kids they're gonna love them it was quick and easy too really good you can see once you cut them how colorful they are it's really really good I know the kids will love them well thanks so much for tuning in to another episode of Cheryl some cooking and watch me make my fruit loop crispy treats they're really really good give them a try I'll see you guys next video bye-bye well thanks so much for tuning in to another episode of Cheryl song cooking please hit the like button subscribe and I'll see you guys next video bye-bye [Music]", "MM3bqmmLDEY": "hi guys and welcome back today's s'more video I am bringing you this delicious s'more gram bar it is so good and so easy so let's just get right into it there's just a couple ingredients you need you need one full box of Golden Grahams cereal five cups of mini marshmallows about a bar or a bar and a half of some kind of milk chocolate whatever your favorite is I prefer meals in it is so delicious and then free to get the spoons of butter starting off in a medium-sized saucepan you're gonna melt down those three tablespoons of butter over medium high heat and then you're gonna add four of the five cups of the mini marshmallows and set the other coven aside for later and stir that down until it is completely melted once you have it all melted together you're gonna add in your golden graham cereal I like to add a bit at a time just makes it easier to completely coat it so do that in increments just mixing it together with the marshmallow and the cereal and then adding more in as you go now you're just gonna add in that last cup of mini marshmallows that you set aside before and you're going to lightly blend this in to make sure you want to work quickly so that way the mixture is not completely set up just yet in the buttered a 9 by 13 pan you can add half of the mixture and just Pat it down to completely until it covers the whole bottom and then once you've done that you're just gonna start adding in your chocolate pieces and randomly throughout the mixture add as many as you want but I actually found that it tasted better if there wasn't too many in there kind of spaced out as I've done here and then just repeat that process for more time adding in the rest of the mixture completely patting it down and then adding your chocolate pieces on top and once it looks like this you are going to set this in the fridge for a couple of hours to set up and I know I'm sorry a couple of hours I wish it would only be like 30 seconds even that seems too long but got a couple of hours in the fridge and then you can take it out and place it up I did 5 across the long way and then the shorter is it four across I don't wouldn't make these too big just because they are a very very decadent dough but you'll probably be going back for seconds regardless program just cut those up as you see fit and then plate them up and they're so delicious I hope you guys have been enjoying my s'mores videos make sure to check out my other ones if you haven't already we did we never talked up some ores and the small part and I'm going to be having another one coming so hope you guys are enjoying this and I will see you guys soon", "xZOfX6UWvPY": "everybody welcome to cheeky Crom today we're going to be making these gorgeous chocolate and not some cereal little pipes these are delicious a friend of mine made these for our New Year's party and people just devoured them like which week devoured them so I thought I'd share the recipe with you today so let's get started what you're gonna need two dots 500 grams of milk chocolate 150 grams of hazelnut 150 grams of almonds 60 grams of cereal 30 grams of chocolate vapors and one tablespoon of corn or vegetable oil firstly you're gonna place your nut in a little blender and we just wanna give them a little weight we don't need to become like crumbs so we don't want the powder but we just don't break them up a little I have transferred my chopped nuts into a bowl and this is what we want some of them are fine and some we still have big chunks and now we're going to place our cereal and our papers in here and I kept a little little handful of cereal just because I like to have them external front and we're gonna do the same thing that we did with the knots and now we can transfer this mixture in with the mouse next you're gonna melt your chocolate over a pan of boiling water hot fine muddy before these fancy and you're just gonna stir this until the chocolate is nice and melted make sure you use a heat proof Bowl or it will shatter in a million pieces once this glorious chocolate hot tub has appeared they're gonna pour in your oil and stir that in next you're gonna take it off the heat and onto your work surface now we're gonna pour all of our dry ingredients into the chocolate a bit of a time so first let's stir this in and stir the rest in we're gonna mix mix mix mix mix into all the nuts and cereal are covered in chocolate goodness so excited now you wanna line a little tray with parchment paper make sure your tray fits in the fridge because we these will have to chill in your fridge for a couple of hours and using a spoon you can make these as big or as small as you like you're just gonna place them on your tray these are simply delicious when my friend brought them at the New Year's party everyone was obsessed with them we were eating these too like 5 a.m. in the morning and they were so good and they were like a really cute like bite sized so you can make these even if you have kids going to school or just like any party reading because it's a great little treat to just pick up an eat now places in the French for 2 hours to toe so here they are our little chocolate and not

quality chocolate cuz it makes a difference", "MSid0_iqiTc": "[ upbeat music playing ]", "6kJIl787dNE": "so the only things you'll be needing are some Reese's puffs cereal some miniature marshmallows some Reese's Pieces candy and some butter so the very first thing we're gonna do is count out six cups of our Reese's puffs cereal as well as grease a 9 by 13 inch baking pan so after you can out your cereal you want to melt four tablespoons of butter in a large pot all right so our butter is almost melted and I don't know if I mentioned earlier but you want to melt it over medium heat so now it's time to add our marshmallows and you just want to constantly stir and make sure that the butter coats all of the marshmallows and just stir until all the marshmallows are completely melted all right so as you can see our marshmallows are completely melted so you don't want to wait immediately after you want to pour them on top of your Reese's cereal you gotta kind of work a little quick here so that they don't dry up support right on in the bowl and then we're gonna and I'm just using a very large spoon to do this the marshmallows are really hot so I would say you could use your hands but the marshmallows are really hard so I wouldn't do that yet not until we pour them in the pan so just keep stirring this until your marshmallows are fully incorporated with your cereal and then we're also going to add 2/3 cup of our Reese's Pieces stir this around alright so this looks about good so now I'm going to transfer it to my 9 by 13 inch pan that I've already sprayed just make sure you spread it nice and evenly all right so after you spread it in your pan then you can go back and add more Reese's Pieces on top if you like I'm just gonna do a few all right now this is where you can use your hands to kind of press down I just find it's the best way just get your hands in there and make sure that the marshmallow should be a little cool by now so shouldn't be too big of a deal and it's just the best way to make sure that they dry evenly and that they harden evenly okay and that is it so just let these dry for about I would say 30 minutes at least before cutting into squares and I'm gonna do that and then show you what they look like when they are cut alright guys so I Ricci puffs treats have been sitting for about 30 minutes so what I did is sprayed my knife with some nonstick cooking spray just to make it easier to cut and they should cut with no problem at all so I just like to cut them into little squares and then you know put them on a cute serving tray especially if you're taking them somewhere so here is one all cut up and plated so this is super easy and takes no time at all so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you make this of course tweet me a picture and I will talk to you next time", "bNTjuqKCcrs": "This weeks chalk art, drawn as a Butterfree Doesn't really have anything to do and I didn't want to erase it yet. So  I decided to keep it for this weeks chalk background! to one of my friends for donating toward my AIDS Life Cycle!! in the links in the description below! Hey guys!! Ray Pajar from Get Crafty Crafty!! And today we'll be making cereal bars! They're kind of like rice crispy treats but instead of using you'll be able to use any type of cereal that you want. Today we'll be using and Trix! Let go ahead and get started with todays project! for todays project include: your favorite cereal, butter, a muffin tray, a spatula, access to an oven and as an option step to put inside your cereal bars. Today I'm using First, either using some or some butter you want to coat the insides of your muffin tray so that the insides wont stick. Once you've done that set it aside. Next inside your large cooking pot, you want to take 3 tablespoons of butter and melt it. Once your butter has completely melted to a medium/ low heat, take your pack of mini marshmallows, and throw it into your mixing pot. Continue to mix your marshmallows into your butter. Once your butter and your marshmallows have completely melted you want to remove it from the heat and add all of your cereal! Carefully mix it in until it's completely coated! Once you've completely mixed your cereal, and it's been covered in it's marshmallow you want to work fast and carefully place them inside your muffin tray. Add about half a spoon full. As an optional step add a few Reese's peanut butter cups. and then add another spoonful to create a little ball! Continue to do this until you've finished all of your cereal bars. As an optional step to using a muffin tray or a casserole tray. Add your cereal treat spread it out sprinkle some Reese's peanut butter cups of your cereal treat. Make sure everything is covered and press down. You want to let your cereal treats chill for about 20 minutes before you cut into them or take them out of the muffin tray. Once your cereal bars have chilled they're ready to be eaten. You could cut them open and enjoy the gooey chocolate part on the inside and as optional step you guys could take a few extra Reese's peanut butter cups and just throw them into your bar. If you guys make this make sure you share it with me either on my facebook, instagram or twitter using the #GetCraftyCrafty hashtag and check out our last two cooking videos: the Yoshi Easter egg and the apple flower blossom.

real family favorite and when you try one you will know why they have this sweet marshmallow flavor and the light and crispy texture I mean it's really hard to eat just one so the first thing you will need is a 9-inch square pan that's 23 centimeters now you could butter your pan or I'm just gonna use one of these nonstick sprays the other thing is you could lightly oil the pan with like a flavorless oil now these are so easy to make you can make them probably in under ten minutes there no bake so we don't have turn the oven on we're just making them by hands you don't have to pull out the mixer essentially all this is is your crispy rice cereal and marshmallows in a little butter so really easy to make now you will need a saucepan and a large bowl I do like to either butter my saucepan or I'm just gonna spray it because if you've ever melted marshmallows you know they're really sticky so it's better to you know spray that and I also sprayed or you could butter your spatula I'm using a heatproof spatula otherwise use a wooden spoon so we are going to add used three tablespoons that's 42 42 grams of butter you can use either salted unsalted or actually my mom always used margarine so uh you know if you want to use that I prefer butter cuz let's face it it tastes better so that's our first thing now I'm just gonna put this on low heat and melt that and while that's melting I did spray again the inside of my bowl you could butter it and you will need six cups which is 150 grams of a crispy rice cereal I'm at actually using Kellogg's Rice Krispies and actually it was Kellogg's that invented this dessert or Treat back in the 1940s a home economist made them and actually this recipe is so popular they actually printed on the back of the box of the rice krispies so I'm just going to mount that and you will also need one 10 ounce package which is 285 grams I like to use the mini marshmallows you could use the large ones but I like the mini because they will melt faster when you're buying them make sure you check the expiration date on the package because if they're kind of old to get kind of sticky and a big lump and they don't melt as nicely so just check that date and if you want you could go to the joy baking com website or our YouTube channel and I actually have a recipe for homemade marshmallows so you could also use that that's so most melted okay I'm gonna add this right in here try to get them all in the pot now some people if you want you can use a large a really large pot and then you can just add the serial rate in there I prefer actually once this is melted to pour it over the top so either way so I'm just going to have this medium-low heat and stir it every once in a while until everything's all melted okay they're all melted so just take it off the heat give it a stir now what I like to do I like vanilla so I'm going to add an extra half a teaspoon two grams of pure vanilla extract just to bump up that vanilla flavor you don't have to you can just leave it out and now all that's left is pour it over the top you know this is a great recipe you know if you have little kids they can help you in measure out the rice krispies and that sort of thing it's a good way of getting them interested in baking because it's really easy so you know they their attention spans are too long so they can make or if you're new to baking try what tries to start out with something like this you know it's easy kind of get you in the kitchen so now we're just going to make sure all of our rice krispies I have some of the coated with the marshmallow that's what I like to use a big bowl I mean if you could use a large pot but I find it easier just okay we're dirtying a bowl but that's okay as you can see buttering or spraying all of your round your pot your utensils that kind of thing makes this easier doesn't stick as much that looks good this is one of my favorite recipes when I was a kid and a teenager I would make this because if you have a sweet tooth which I do easy to make fast and I'm just dump them in and you know what I find adults like these every bit as much as kids so I still do so now now this is as you can see really sticky so what I do you can get sometimes they take like a piece of wax paper parchment paper and put a little butter on there and Pat it down but what I do is just wet my hands just very just moisten them and just use my hands and we just want to flatten press that down until it's nice and firm now if you can resist it's best to let these sit a while till they firm up and then it's much easier to cut because as you can see they're really soft and you know what if you can't wait then what you can do is just have a look so that that is essentially rice krispie treats so we are done I am gonna let this cool down and firm up so be much easier to cut and I know this is like sticky really sticky so just put some hot soapy water in your pot and in your bowl let it sit a little bit and then it'll be really easy to clean up so when we come back we will cut them into squares and try one so now I let the rice krispies treats it about a half-hour and they're nice and firm now you can just cut them right in the pan which is normally what I do but if you want to take them over the pan first just run a knife or I'm using an offset spatula and then you can just come up really easy and then if you want I mean cut it that way or we can just flip them over and then you can cut them as big or as small as you want it's a large knife you hear that nice crispy and yeah I'll just cut off a little bit to try now these are good very good there they are sweet with that marshmallow flavor they are nice and crispy you know there's lots of especially now you get a lot of gourmet recipes for rice krispie treats but you know what I keep going back to just the classic you know marshmallows the cereal and a little butter really they're fantastic so I don't want to mess with it now these are good you know the day that they're made probably the best but I find you'd cover them you can store them quite a few days if you put them into the refrigerator which is normally what I do if I store them overnight keeps them nice and crispy so you know a great recipe a classic crisp it's easy sure but we all need that a nice easy recipe that tastes great so try it and until next time I'm Stephanie jour ski of Joey baking calm [Music]", "GD6YRWP47RU": "hi I'm Stephanie drawer ski of joy baking calm today we're going to make chocolate energy bars and this is what they look like this is a no-bake two layer bar the top layer is chocolate and underneath you have this soft and chewy mixture of really just dates and nuts it's really easy to make and they taste great and they're healthy so I'm the first thing we need to do is you will need a just a loaf pan and I like to line it with a piece of foil you could also line it with you know plastic wrap or parchment paper and then I'm just going to butter my foil or you could spray it with one of those nonstick sprays I like to use a foil because then they're so easy to get out of the pan you just kind of lift the foil up so now the first thing we need to do is to soften our dried dates in some hot water so you will need a boat one cup 240 milliliters 240 grams of hot water and then you will need one cup which is about 155 grams of dried chopped dates of court in this this is what they look like and a lot of times they have the seeds sometimes you can buy them they're already pitted sometimes not but it's very easy you just cut it and then you have the seed inside let's take that out and then coarsely chop I like to my personal preference if you can find them is the medjool dates really like the flavor of them and you want to make sure like you can see these are really quite soft already you don't want those dried ones really I mean like kind of hard dates and typically and I'm just going to put them in the water you will find the dried dates I find them in the produce section of my grocery store sometimes they are in bulk and sometimes they are in like plastic tubs so then I'm just going to let those sit now depending on house off your dates I would say you want them quite soft because we're going to make a paste out of them so maybe 5 10 minutes and then you want to drain them so I'm just going to let them sit and when we come back we'll start our bars okay so now our dates are nice and soft they've absorbed some of the water so I'm just going to put them in through a strainer and let those run off for a bit and now we will start our energy bars I am giving you here just a very basic recipe for an energy bar you can really play with this recipe make it your own so the first thing we will need is some nuts I'm going to use peanuts today and they're roasted and they are salted you can use the unsalted but you don't have to use peanuts you could use I've used almonds they're very good cashews or hazelnuts really or kind of do a mixture of nuts and you will need 1 cup which is about 140 grams of peanuts and then I am going to add because I'm making chocolate energy bars I'm going to add just 1 tablespoon which is about 5 grams of unsweetened cocoa powder you could use Dutch processed or just a natural you don't even have to add the cocoa powder if you do not want chocolate you can just have the nuts so what we're going to do now is I'm going to process the nuts until they're pretty finely ground I actually like adding a little bit of cocoa powder because you don't want to be very careful you don't want your nuts to end up as a paste and the cocoa powder helps to prevent that so this is going to get noisy okay so this is what you're looking for this piece is quite pretty finely ground and then I'm just going to add for flavoring a half a teaspoon two grams of pure vanilla extract again you don't have to add that if your nuts were not salted you might want to add just a pinch of salt and then really we're going to add dates there's no sugar there's no fat like butter or oil the dates are not only going to add in the weather they've ever had dates but they are quite sweet so that's going to be our sugar and we're going to when we process them they become a paste so then they're going to be that is what's going to bind all our ingredients together so I just have some paper towel here and I'm just going to dry them off a little and I'm going to put them in here and then I'm going to pulse this until you get a nice like a batter I guess you'd call it kind of clumps together hey we're almost there you can see starting to clump so I have to do it a little more I'm going to add some more chocolate I'm going to add a quarter of a cup 45 grams of some chocolate chips I'm adding them at this point because I if I added them at the beginning they would really just get into really small pieces I want like little chunks so I'm putting them in now well this pulse a little more okay so you can see that's our mixture and we're done is that not great now you could add if you wanted to add some other dried fruit cherries dried cherries or cranberries are very good so you could add a bit of that I mean really just have fun you know maybe you want to do it the first time like I did and then after that you just have fun with it so I'm just going to put this because essentially this is your energy bar now we're going to put some chocolate over top but you don't have to you could just have them just like this and you know this and then just press it in what is great is evil you can store these at room temperature maybe for about a week I like to I always put mine in the refrigerator their last a couple weeks you could put them in the freezer for a couple months I mean and they're healthy and they taste so good and even if you don't like if you're not in kind of go I'm not really crazy about dates uh it's amazing with the nuts and the chocolate you don't really get like a real date flavor and smooth talk so now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to put these into the refrigerator maybe a half hour just to further this so this firms up a bit and then when we come back we are going to put some chocolate on top so now for our chocolate topping you will need a saucepan of simmering water and heat proof Bowl I like to stainless steel although you could you could melt your chocolate in the microwave if you want so you will need three ounces which is 90 grams of a semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate and what you want to do is use a chocolate that you just enjoy like just eating out of hand and there's put that in the bowl along with I'm adding about a half a tablespoon about 6 grams of butter I find that that just makes your chocolate once it's melted kind of go it more fluid so to put that and I'm just going to melt it like I said if you want to do it in your microwave go ahead and do that just be very careful you don't want to burn your chocolate okay so our chocolate is melted stick it off the heat like that I just want to get the moisture off of the bottom of my bowl because I don't want to get water in my chocolate and then we are just going to pour our chocolate over our bars spread it out and we are done I love these easy red easy recipes take no time and they are really good and then just take you take the back of a spoon offset spatula just spread it out and then I'm going to put these back into the refrigerator you know maybe about 15 minutes I need that chocolate to harden up a little before I I cut them into bars because it's way too soft now what I do is just kind of just shake it it kind of evens it out and gets it nice and shiny again smooth so I'm just going to put this back into the refrigerator and when we come back we will try one okay so now our chocolate has firmed up so just take the ends your foil lift it out and back and then cut them into bars um any sauce you want if you see here what I've done is actually I just cut this in half and then get a real clean cut just wipe your knife off in between my chocolates still like a little soft and then this if you want to go this size here then cut each half into thirds now if you want to be perfect you get your ruler out but I'm just going to eyeball today don't these it looks so cool so there you have it now like I said you can store them when you put the chocolate on top I would store them in the refrigerator probably two three weeks or in the freezer for two or three months now actually this whole bar these are very pretty rich so you might want to even cut these in half it's such a great snack or for breakfast and you know what the kids don't even know that these are really healthy really soft you you know what they to me because I use peanuts it tastes like a chocolate bar but a chocolate bar that's really good for you got the peanuts and those dates add so much sweetness I don't actually taste the dates I just the sweetness of it and then of course the chocolate they're great perfect snack give to your kids try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm",

make cookies and cream rice krispies treats these are really really yummy and really easy to make so let's go build a good sized saucepan and put it on low to medium heat Chuck in quarter of a cup of butter so with the butter just put some of it up like this on the sides this will help the next part then get about 300 grams of marshmallows which is about ten and a half ounces and stir these through now take this off the heat and we'll get on to the next part now add five cups of rice bubbles or rice krispies and stir this in now get ten Oreos and just chop them up or bash them into small pieces little chunks and some fun powers powers not powers and just mix this through now get a baking dish about 13 by 9 inches roughly this size pour the mixture in now when you put it in there just flatten it best thing to do is just wet your hands with some water and squash it around and flatten it now just put this aside let it sit just a little bit and we'll get on to the next part now get one and a half cups of white chocolate and melt this in the microwave just put it on high for 30 seconds give it a stir and repeat that until it's completely melted we get the white chocolate and just try to pour it evenly over the top now we're going to spread this out so it's just one layer now just spread this out as best you can now crush up three or four Oreos so they're powdery and chunks in it and just spread it over the top now pop this in the fridge and let it sit should flow I hope you like these which one do I eat I'll see you next time for my next meal", "6uLvcvd0uMk": "[UPBEAT MUSIC] Hey, guys. It's Desiree, and I have a\nvery special guest with us here today. This is Jessica, a.k.a. Mister Krisp. Hi! And she has an awesome\nnew book out that shows you how to make over\n90 different crispy treats. There's everything\nin there, from-- Everything. --dinosaurs to the\nEiffel Tower, so depending on what you want to\ntake on, lots to choose from. But we're going to show you\nthree from the book today, and they are chocolate\nchip cookies, lollipops, and mini doughnuts. Fun twists on your\nfavorite desserts. We're going to get started with\nthese yummy-looking chocolate chip cookies. Yay! And these cookies are incredible\nbecause unlike regular cookies that are really hot when\nthey come out of the oven, you can eat these immediately. Chow down right away. Yeah. Let's get started. Cool. We have 4 tablespoons of\nbutter in the pot right now. So I think we are ready to\nadd the marshmallows, Desiree. All right, we'll add those in. Awesome, so now we're just going\nto stir until the marshmallows are coated. And my biggest tip when\nmaking crispy rice treats is that you don't want to let\nyour marshmallows melt down too much. The more you let your\nmarshmallows melt, the harder your final\nproject will be, and we all want things to be\nchewy and delicious for days to come. So as you can see, there is\nsome gooey melted marshmallow, but you could also still see\nthose marshmallow chunks. They are not going anywhere. So I am going to, at this\npoint, turn off the burner, and we are going to\nadd some food coloring. So I'm just going to add\na couple drops of white, and then just a\ndrop of base brown. If you don't have brown\nand white food coloring to add to this mixture,\nyou can use peanut butter. And then, it's time\nto add our cereal. So Desiree, if you will-- There we are. And now, we are just\ngoing to give it a little stir until\nit looks like it's partially incorporated. And then, we're going to\nadd our chocolate chips. So let's add half of that, and\nthen we can add more as we go. All right. And what's so great about using\nchocolate chips in this recipe is that they start to melt,\nand they give the treats even more of that brown color. And now we're ready\nto mold our cookies. Since cookies don't have\nthat perfect round shape, we mold them by hand. And one of my biggest tips and\ntricks when making crispy rice treats by hand is that you\ndon't want them to stick to you, so we just use cooking\nspray directly on our hands and that will prevent\nthem from sticking and makes our life a lot easier. So I'm just going\nto spray directly on my hands, and\nDesiree, you do the same. OK. You just rub it together. Coated up. We're coated up, and then we'll\nbe ready to start molding. All right. So what we'll do-- I'll do the first one, and\nthen we'll kind of just go from there. So this sort of does,\nreally, at this point look like cookie dough. Yeah. So I just globbed\na blob of this out, and I'm just going to very\ngently press it together. And like I said, this\nis edible right now. Obviously, we're not going to\neat it because we're classy. [LAUGHS] And we are showing you how\nto do this, but we could. This is one of my\nfavorite projects to make. I just think it's so simple. Anybody can do it. Yeah. And the last thing\nwe're going to do is add some chips to the top-- Great. --just sort of in any\nunexpected pattern. These are just adorable. So fun. There you have it, first project\ndone-- chocolate chip cookies. Chocolaty hands too. Now that we're done with\nthose chocolate chip cookies, we're going to make doughnuts\nout of crispy rice treats. And these have a twist from\nthe ones in your book, right? Yeah, so these are\nactually mini doughnuts. We have this mini\npan, and we are going to make bite-sized doughnuts. Sounds good. Let's going on it. I'm excited. We have 3 tablespoons\nof butter, and that is 4 cups of mini marshmallows. And then, it's time\nto add our cereal. So now we are ready to\nget molding and making our little decorated doughnuts. So the first thing we're going\nto do is get our little mold, and we are going to use\ncooking spray to not just spray the mold, which\nwe'll do first, generously, but we're also going\nto spray our hands. That way we can\nhandle the mixture. I'm moisturizing today. Yeah, seriously. So now, we're just going to\ngrab mixture, bit by bit. So I have just like a\nlittle nugget, if you will, and we're going to start\npressing it into the doughnut pan, making sure that we\ncan see that little center piece so it'll actually\nhave a hole in it, because what's a\ndoughnut without a hole? This is really easy to\nshape these in here. So now we have our\nmini doughnuts molded, and we are just going to\nflip the pan over so we can start decorating them. It's raining doughnuts. [LAUGHS] These are so cute! So cute, so we got our\nlittle baby doughnuts. And if you have more\nmixture left over, you can just start molding\nthem right into the pan again, but we're just going\nto lay these out. And now we're going\nto start decorating, which is the fun part. I mean, all of this\nis the fun part. Who am I kidding? Yeah. So I just have some\nWilton Decorating Icing, and I'm just going to cover\nthe top of the doughnut. And we're also\ngoing to use pink. So that we have, like,\na strawberry flavor. Exactly, so we'll just like-- and this is a really fun\nway to customize a project. You can use any color\nicing that you like, whatever works for you. If you have a team\nthat you really like, you can ice it in\nyour team colors. That's a good idea. So now that we have\nthese iced, we're going to push down on\nthe chocolate icing. So now that our\ndoughnuts are iced, we're going to add some\ndecorating details. And we're going to start\nwith some sprinkles, because what are doughnuts\nwithout sprinkles? Especially rainbow sprinkles. Right? Perfect. That was really simple. Look at these little babies! Now we have 12 little,\nbite-sized crispy rice treat doughnuts. They're so cute. I love them. So we've made the chocolate\nchip cookies, mini doughnuts, and we have one more crispy\nrice treat for you guys. They're little lollipops. The lollipops are\nso easy-to-make and so easy-to-eat, and food\nis just better on a stick. This is very true. Let's get started. Let's go. First, we're going\nto add our butter. It appears that our\nbutter is melted, so we're going to add\nour mini marshmallows now and adding a little\nfood coloring. So we have our pink food\ncoloring, just a couple drops, going right into the marshmallow\nmixture, right in the pot. So in order to assemble\nthese lollipops, we're going to use\nCandy Melts that will adhere to lollipop\nstick to the treats. So while these treats settle a\nlittle bit for no more than two to three minutes, we are\ngoing to melt our Candy Melts. It's perfect. That's all the time we need. Perfect! We're going to let these\nmelt for about a minute, check it, stir,\nand then continue in 30-second increments. So now that we've\nmelted our Candy Melts, it's time to mold our\ntreats into little balls so that we can make\nthem into lollipops. So this happens really\nquickly, and it's really easy to do once you've sprayed\nyour hands with cooking spray. So we're both going\nto spray our hands, rub them together, and grab\nlittle bits of treat at a time and just mold them into balls. And because we were making the\nCandy Melts, these hardened a little bit, which makes\nthem easier to mold. OK, so now we have our balls\nand making these into lollipops is super simple. All you need are some lollipop\nsticks and the Candy Melts, and I'm going to show\nyou how it's done. So you're going to take one\nlollipop stick and one ball, and you're going to\nmake a hole, gently. You're going to dip the same\nstick right into the Candy Melt and make sure you\nget a little glob. And then, stick\nit right back in. You're then going\nto just press gently to make sure that\nit's all formed. And there you have\nit, your lollipop. There we go. It's perfect. Once it's set, yeah. And there you have it. We just made three really\neasy crispy rice treats. Thank you so much, Jessica. Thank you so much for having me. It was really easy,\nand it was really fun.

a stir and then put it back in the microwave for 1 minute intervals stirring after each minute until it's melted and nice and smooth and once you get that nice smooth texture add one cup of salted peanuts stir those in and then you're going to add some cereal the recipe asks for Cheerios I'm using a kind of a multigrain no-name store brand cheerio that works just as well I stir it in four cups of that cereal you could probably get away with using whatever sterile you want with this but the Cheerios are actually quite nice then grease a 9 by 13 inch baking dish and in place the cereal mixture in the bottom of it and just press it down until it's nice and flat or as flat as you can get it then in a microwave proof container you're going to place one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips 1/2 cup of butter or margarine and a quarter cup of peanut butter put that in the microwave for 30 to 60 seconds on high until it's melted take it out give it a good stir and pour it over the top of the cereal mixture and then you're going to let it set I put mine in the refrigerator to speed that up but the final product does not need to be kept in the refrigerator so there is a piece just to show you what the texture and what it looks like on the bottom some of the caramel kind of pulls on the bottom a bit and when you break these apart you will see the texture they're crunchy and they're nice and chewy and you've got that nice smooth chocolate layer on the top they are delicious these tastes a lot like a combination between a O'Henry bar and a Twix bar if you can imagine that give them a try if you enjoy no bake recipes you may want to give this one a try it's no bake cookies and cream bars so go ahead and click on your screen or check out the link in the description box and as

so welcome back to my channel so if you're interested in knowing how i made this chocolate drizzle rice krispie treats just stay tuned for this video so you're going to need butter chocolate bars toffee and i use the assorted cereals from the variety box and also marshmallows [Music] so first you need about a cup and a half i meant to say a half a cup butter melt the butter in the pan and then you're to add your marshmallows so i used about two of those marshmallow packs [Music] so here i'm just adding the toffee into the marshmallow mixture and this is just to add some extra stickiness to the treats [Music] [Music] so here are the cereals that i used um these were just my preference you can use any kind of cereals that you want and i'm just basically measuring them out putting them in a bowl and then adding them into the mixture the marshmallow mixture [Music] so it should start looking like this once you've add the cereals into the marshmallow mixture and just make sure that the mixture is incorporated well with the cereals and just make sure that everything is well blended so now i'm just adding the mixture into the muffin tins and i'm making sure that i do you know pack it in there so that it does take the shape of the muffin tins so when i take it out it does look like you know it has a muffin shape [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so now i'm just going to use um some boiling hot water that i've placed in my pot to basically melt the chocolate bars and i'm just using my spatula to you know just hold the chocolate bar over the boiling water so that it will melt [Music] so here i'm just using the melted chocolate bar as a piping bag just to drizzle the chocolate on top of the treats [Music] so yeah guys these were super quick and super fun to make and i'm sure if you have children they would love to make this with you as well so guys if you like this video please comment down below share the video like the video and also subscribe to my channel

a great day", "H0iOT0vu1Hk": "hey you guys it's miss Katie and I'm joining you today via another YouTube video so what I have for you guys today is actually another recipe video I did one I think a week and a half ago or two weeks ago so this was actually fairly easy to follow along with and the ingredients are super common as well this is also another instance where I just found this stuff around my house so in the next few minutes I'm going to lead you guys through the instructions of how to do it and if you guys do choose to follow along and make it as well if you could post it to our Instagram tagging us or in our facebook I'm gonna put it right there like I always do that would be awesome because we'd love to see what you guys come up with so in this next two minutes I'm gonna show you guys how to do it so let's get into it before anything make sure you have clean hands so the things you'll need for this recipe is some cereal I did Apple Jacks and I also did rice krispies as well and then you're also gonna need a stick of butter and you're also going to need a bag of marshmallows so the first thing we're gonna do is grab our bag of marshmallows and we're gonna grab our butter and you're gonna need a bowl to put your butter and your marshmallows in this is actually gonna be the mixture that holds all of the rice krispies treat together so you want to put a lot of marshmallows in so it's super sticky and then we're gonna put our mixture in the microwave for two minutes so it'll melts and there you go so when it comes out of the microwave your mixtures gonna look like this it's actually pretty funny to watch because the marshmallows grow a lot in the microwave and what I did is I actually put a little bit more marshmallows in there because it wasn't quite to where it needed to be yet in terms of thickness so I added a few more marshmallows and then I popped it right back in the microwave and it came out like this a little bit thicker which is really good this part isn't mandatory but I popped just a little bit of vanilla in there for a little bit more flavor and keep in mind a little bit of vanilla goes a long way so then I mixed it together so after I was done mixing all of this together I grabbed a super big mixing bowl and I dumped at my rice krispies in there and I also put my Apple Jacks in there as well so now that all of this is together in the mixing bowl I went ahead and grabbed my marshmallow mixture and I started to pour it on top all over my cereal and then I started to mix it together just with a spoon and when you're mixing it together you want to make sure to fold it in together so each part of the cereal gets coated evenly when I was mixing it together I noticed I needed a little bit more marshmallows to make it a little bit more sticky so it would stick together nicely so I just heated some up and then you're gonna get your pan and you're gonna spray it with cooking spray so it doesn't stick to the pan and then when I put my rice krispies treats in the pan I let it sit and cool for a little bit and I patted it down with my hands as well just to make sure that it was nice and firm and it was all even across the pan and after that you're all done I just cut mine up into little squares and that's it", "LAyto6HXObI": "[Music] [Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel savvylicious arrangements so here i'm going to be showing you guys how i make my rice krispie treats without the silicone mold the soap mold that i was using and this right here you see this this is called paramount crystals okay in my last video you guys asked me a thousand times matter of fact more than a thousand times because that video got over a hundred thousand views so you guys asked me at least five thousand times all right and i'm here to help but sometimes it's better just to read the comments so that way um we're not asking the same questions over and over and over again but here i'm just telling you guys that this is called paramount crystals what does paramount crystals do paramount crystals helps the chocolate to flow evenly um it helps the chocolate melt and it gives the chocolate a shiny coat so here i have my um wooden sticks or screws whatever you like to call it i have my rice krispies treats yes i use the ones from the store because i've made rice krispies treats from scratch uh one time and within like a couple hours they were still so i was just like uh nope not doing this i'm not taking my hard earned time and opening up a box of cereal open a box of marshmallows um and just it's just too much for them to be stale within the next couple hours so yes i do like to use the ones from the store it's nothing wrong with it here i just have my chocolate you see how evenly my chocolate flows just by using the paramount crystals you don't have to use these um if you choose not to you don't have to um it's just something that i like to use when i melt in my chocolate just because it melts it um faster and it's evenly and it flows a lot better um it doesn't give you that thick chocolate like some of the wilton chocolates can be sometimes um so i'm just unwrapping my rice krispies treat bars and i'm just placing them onto my counter and um i'm going to start inserting my sticks so here's my wooden score i'm going to dip this into my chocolate or candy melts and i'm going to place that into my rice krispies treat and then i'm going to take my decorative straw and i'm going to place that into my rice krispie treat also so the stick gives it this ability and then the straw just gives it the extra stability and the decoration so i'll be doing this with the red chocolate also and um if you would like to see a more in-depth video of the rice krispie treats because it seemed like you guys love those videos so much uh just leave it in the comments below and whatever questions you have i'll be free to answer and if i feel as though that it would be something more i can get out there for you then i would definitely do a more in-depth video of the rice krispie treats so this is what it looks like this the chocolate that's sitting um on top of the rice krispie treat you're gonna place these in the refrigerator the freezer somewhere cold and chilled um so that the chocolate on it can get hard so have you ever dipped your rice krispie treat and you only place the straw in it and not the stick and when it was time for you to dip your rice krispie treat fell off your straw so this is what we're using the stick and dipping the chocolate into the straw to give it that stability so when you go ahead and dip it um it won't fall off your it won't fall off your stick okay i've in the beginning of me dipping rice krispie treats um i had those problems where i would just insert my decorative straw and go to dip and it would fall off of my rice krispie treat or to fall off my um my stick and i would be so frustrated because i'm like now what am i supposed to do so i use the stick for stability so i'm just going to be dipping my rice krispie treats into my yellow candy melts and this part is kind of self-explanatory you can pretty much see what i'm doing i'm just dipping my rice krispie treat on one side and then turning it around and dipping it and shaking off all of the excess chocolate and i'm going to place them standing up on my baking sheet you can lay them down if you choose to but um it gets flat in the back when you lay them down and sometimes uh it can if you don't take off a lot of the chocolate like i'm doing here like dragging it off it will um give you a puddle of that chocolate in the back while you're laying it down and you don't want that because you want your rice krispie treats to stand up depending on what event you're doing so if you're having a candy table you would want your rice krispies treats to stand up you don't want them to lay down because that doesn't look that doesn't really look attractive you know so i'm doing the same thing with the red candy melts and i'm trying to give you guys a good video of how i'm i dip my rice krispie treat so it's pretty simple i just start all the way from the bottom um i dip it and then i turn it over and then i re-dip it again and then i drag it off at the bottom so there's no extra puddle on my rice krispie treat and this is what it looks like once the chocolate sets um on the wax paper or your silicone mat or whatever so here sometimes you get rice krispies treats that like to do with something you know they like to lean they like to rot they like to you know do the franchise boys dance so sometimes you just gotta fidget with it and bend it a little bit so that it can be standing upright so here's what the um rice krispie treats look like once they set pretty much so here i'm taking some techno glitter which is pretty much called um disco dust uh some people call it edible glitter it's a non-toxic glitter that you can use for decoration purposes it doesn't harm the body um you won't get sick from it it's up to you if you choose to use it or not these little bottles are 5.99 um they don't go a long way depending on what you're doing so here i'm showing you how i apply my um non-toxic glitter to my treats so because it's only a little bit in these little jars i just coat the front of uh the rice krispie treat so here i'm just taking my steamer and i am applying the disco dust to the rice krispie treat so that way it has something to stick to because i let the chocolate set you can normally do this when you first dip your chocolate um and then you can go ahead and apply your glitter but um you can go ahead and apply your glitter but because i was doing this for the video i wanted to show you other ways that you can go ahead and apply your glitter if your chocolate sets up so if you don't have a steamer you can also boil water on the stove and you can take your pot bring it over to wherever your workstation is and you can take the rice rice krispie treat and hold it over the steam so that way the rice krispies treat can get a little uh sweaty and go ahead and apply your disco dust to it and if you're doing multiple things at one time so say uh for me i had to do a dozen cupcake toppers a dozen rice krispie treats a dozen strawberries and a dozen oreos so um if you only have one of these little bottles of the techno glitter is not gonna work you're gonna need several bottles or several little jars so i would say at least four for each color that you're using if you're only using one color then you would just need four little bottles but if you're doing multiple colors like i'm doing then you would need to purchase four little bottles of each color and they become they can become very pricey the cheapest place you probably can find them is amazon um unless you go to your nearest local cake shop uh they have bacon supplies and majority of time they do sell them but they can be pricey also because they're purchasing it from someone else so this is what the rice krispie treats look like i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you would like more information about it please um leave it in the description box below and i will see you in my next one", "N6KMAyyA1EA": "[Music] you hello friends welcome back to my channel I know that you guys are probably thinking like Jessica I'm here just cranking her videos you know she cares about us and I - I really do I want to make sure you guys have some really quick and easy quarantine stacks and today we are making red velvet rice krispie treats so if you're interested in learning how to make them please continue to watch so in a large pot we are going to melt down one stick of butter over medium heat and once that butter has melted we are going to reduce the heat to low and we are going to add 16 ounces of mini marshmallows now that all the marshmallows have been added I'm gonna take a silicon spatula and I'm going to stir those around in the butter we want all the marshmallows to be coated with the butter and we're going to leave the heat on low and allow these to melt down slowly do not turn up the heat to rush the process you want to allow these two mountain dices slow so they mow evenly and you don't want this mixture to burn [Music] so now that the marshmallows are fully melted down we are going to add in the ingredient that turns these into red velvet rice krispies treats and that special ingredient is red velvet cake mix you guys so if you thought that you were going to pull out your cocoa powder and your red food coloring you were wrong this is a quarantine friendly recipe we are keeping our ingredients to a minimum and the red velvet cake mix gets the job done [Music] once of the cake mix is fully incorporated turn off your stove and add in the rice krispies cereal I added my cereal and about a cup at a time just to make sure that all of the cereal was coated in the marshmallow mixture [Music] in to shake my rice crispies I'm using my bar baking pan if you don't have one of these you can use a 8x8 baking dish and just make sure you spray it with nonstick cooking spray like Pam and as you can see I'm just taking a heaping tablespoon of the rice krispies mixture and I'm just pressing it into those squares and when I am working with the rice krispies mixture I am spraying Pam on my fingertips off-camera just to make sure that it doesn't stick to my hands I allow these to sit for about an hour until they were completely cool and then I took a butter knife went around the edges and just flip them out of the pan and as you can see they were all uniform in shape and perfect just like I like them and to be completely honest I thought that the plain rice krispies trees look like raw ground beef so off camera I took some white chocolate and I melted that down along with some pink candy melts and I just drizzled that across the top to make it look nicer so there you have it you guys that's how I make rice krispies treats and all it took was one special ingredient to make them extra special so if you decide to make this recipe please let me know down in the comments also please like this video and subscribe to my channel you guys I have so many amazing videos coming your way especially because with us being in the house I want to make sure that you guys are making some delicious food so please connect with me so that I can stay connected with you and I will see you guys in the next video stay safe out there good bye", "1vcsigaQdVA": "hey everyone Liz Merrick here and today I'm going to tell you all about rice cereal how to make it how to use it how to love it so let's get our recipe together and get started you okay step 1 melt down your marshmallows for about a minute until they're nice and soft and gooey just like this then you're going to add in your rice cereal and give it a mix mix mix mix once that's mostly incorporated you're going to add your melted chocolate go ahead and give that a good mix and if it feels like it's still pretty wet you can go ahead and add some more rice cereal you definitely don't want this to be a gooey mixture you want there to be just enough marshmallows and chocolate to make the rice cereal stick together but you don't really want any wet spots so the first thing we're going to do with this rice cereal is we're going to make rice cereal sheets this is great for stacking your rice cereal just like you would a sculpted cake so it's very similar to doing things with cake and it's great for competitions or doing things like cars or buildings so I just play some plastic wrap in the bottom of a sheet cake pan and I'm going to spray it with a little bit of vegetable oil to prevent sticking and I'm going to press my freshly made rice cereal right into that sheet pan I'm putting a little bit of vegetable shortening on my hands to prevent sticking when I press this in but if you are making this for the public I would probably recommend wearing gloves so go ahead and press that deep down into all the corners putting as much pressure on it as you can the more you can press the stronger the rice-cereal sheets are going to be and then once you got that in there and it's all nice and firm you want to put this in the refrigerator and let it chill until it's solid once your rice cereal treats are chilled you can take it out of the pan and then stack them and carve them any way you like the plastic wrap helps pull it out of the pan cleanly but you might need to use a knife to get it started you can still see it's pretty flexible that's the marshmallows in the rice cereal but once it chills completely it'll be pretty solid so now I'm just cutting up my rice cereal treats into different size shapes and I like the glue mine together with just melted chocolate that just adds to the stability of the structure and but you could definitely use something like ganache if you wanted to so I'm stacking these rice cereal treats just like you would cake and then I'm just using a serrated knife to cut the ends off and shape them into whatever shape you need them to be so this is a great process to use if you need to make something with really sharp edges or to make sure that you don't have any lumps or bumps so the next thing we're going to talk about is just hand forming there's not really a lot of secrets to this basically all you need to do is just wait maybe five or ten minutes after you prepare your rice cereal treats before you start hand forming this gives the sugar and the marshmallows a chance to kind of chill out and get a little bit less sticky so that when you start putting pressure on your rice cereal treats and forming it into a shape it doesn't just disintegrate and fall into nothing so again just put some vegetable shortening on your hands to prevent sticking and really compact your rice cereal into whatever shape you need it to be and I tend to make my shapes a little bit bigger than I need so that I can carve it down and make the outside smooth for when I add my fondant or modeling chocolate the last thing we're going to talk about is when you want your rice cereal to be gravity-defying this is something that can be difficult depending on what type of structure you're using so I'm just going to talk about one type of structure but you can use these that you can use this information for any type of structure really so what I have here is just a threaded rod screwed into the bottom of a cake board and let's say you had a cake on top of this cake board and you wanted to create something looking like it was floating above the cake like a balloon or swimming fish or a flying owl or something like that then you would assemble your board with the threaded rod I have more information on these types of structures from structures on sugar geek show com if you're interested but you would put your cake over the threaded rod you would cover the threaded rod with food-safe aluminum foil tape and then we would create a supporting structure with a nut and a washer and a piece of cardboard so I'm just going to take my nut and screw that down onto the threaded rod and then I'm going to place a washer the washer is important because it helps support the cardboard I'm just using a regular cake board I'm just going to cut down the sides so it's not quite as big you can also use foam board or wood or whatever you need depending on how heavy or your structure is I think what people tend to make a mistake in doing is they just want to attach the rice cereal straight to the threaded rod or to the dowel or to the to the stick or whatever it is that they're using and then the rice cereal falls off and that's because rice cereal is actually pretty heavy so you can't just stick it to the rod and expect it to stay there because the weight of the rice cereal will pull it down so you definitely always have to have some sort of structure underneath the rice cereal to support it just like you would a cake so I just put a nut on the top of the other side of the cardboard to just secure the cardboard in place so it doesn't wobble around and now you can cover your threaded rod with your aluminum foil tape to make it food safe you never want to have to just touching straight metal that's a new new but once you get it all covered then you can add some melted marshmallows to the outside of the tape and what this does is this actually helps the rice cereal stick to the structure this is a really important step and if you're if you've ever had a problem where your rice cereal was slipping off of the dowel or the PVC pipe this is this is why it just doesn't want to stick to anything other than marshmallows so if you put marshmallows on to the structure then your ice cereal will stick to a no problem so once you have your marshmallows on your structure you can go ahead and just put them around the marshmallow and press it on to your structure just like you would if your hand for me and you just want to compress as much as you can and just get it on there really well just remember you don't want to start handling your rice cereal mixture until it's set up for five or ten minutes otherwise it's just going to pull apart and fall off your structure so after you've got your rice cereal where you want it the next thing you want to do is wrap it with your plastic wrap and what this does is it acts basically is your hands it keeps the rice cereal compressed against your structure while it fully chills and hardens up so that it doesn't pull away and start falling down and cracking and making you cry so wrapping and putting the marshmallows on the structure are two very important keys to making your rice cereal stick to your structure so after your rice cereal has chilled and fully hardened you can go ahead and remove your wrapping plastic and now you might be wondering well now what now do I do with this lump of rice cereal well now is the point where you can go ahead and carve down the rice cereal into the shape that you need to be you can add modeling chocolate you can add fondant you can add all your little details and you don't have to worry about your rice cereal coming off of your structure you would just use a serrated knife just like we did with the rice cereal sheets to just carve down your shape and get a nice smooth outer edge before you start adding things like fondant or modeling chocolate and a lot of people ask what do I need to add to this to get the fondant or the wall and chocolate to stick and the answer is you don't really need to add anything you could just spray the outside of the rice cereal with a little bit of water or you can just go ahead and press it right on there and it should stick pretty well the key is you don't want to use fondant or modeling chocolate that's too thin because then it is going to you are going to see lumps and things through and if you really want it to be super smooth you can always put a layer of royal icing over everything and that kind of settles into the lumps and bumps but really if you carve it down into something that's flat you don't really need to do anything else other than that the other thing is if you want the bottom side of your gravity-defying rice cereal treat structure to be rounded and not flat people will try and stick rice cereal on the underside of the cardboard to get it to be round and then it falls off and it pulls away and you cry and we're trying to avoid that so what you should do is just use some modeling chocolate to just shape that bottom side of your structure you can attach it with a little bit of glue if you want like melted chocolate but really it should just stick straight up to the cardboard no problem and it will firm up to be rock-hard it helps support the rice cereal structure and it's basically seamless it's something that's super easy super reliable and you won't be crying so that's about it now you can start decorating your rice cereal any way you want I prefer using modeling chocolate I'm using a sweet tastic modeling chocolate right now there's other great brands like magic chocolate or hot hands all great stuff you can even make your own modeling chocolate if you want to and the reason I love modeling chocolate is that you can make big sheets of it put it over the rice cereal it sticks all on its own and then you can easily blend the seams together and you won't even notice that you have covered it up together so hopefully that has answered your questions about how to use rice cereal treats when you're modeling when you're sculpting or when you're trying to create something that's gravity-defying if you want to see more tutorials like this one that are more in depth you can check me out on wcco.com where I have tons of tutorials that are more elaborate and teach all kinds of good stuff i'm liz merrick and i'll see you guys next time thanks for watching you", "vZc9mz1vL1Y": "fruity pebble roll-ups hello everyone start off with you'll need a large bowl and four cups of miniature marshmallows add to that three tablespoons of butter put this in the microwave for about one minute to one minute thirty seconds until the marshmallows are all puffy and the butter is melted and then stir it together to get something that's nice and smooth if you don't want to do this in the microwave you can do it in a large pot on the stove on low heat now you add in your fruity pebbles that is six cups of fruity pebbles which are basically like fruit flavored rainbow rice krispies if you can imagine that it tastes a lot like Froot Loops stir that in until all the little fruity pebbles are covered with marshmallow mixture and then turn it out into a large baking dish that's been greased or in my case I used a cookie sheet covered with a silicone mat and spread it around into a very large rectangle about 13 by 9 approximately Pat it down using greased fingers or a greased spatula until it's nice and even and then allow it to cool for about 10-15 minutes and this is what the fruity pebble box it looks like if you're wondering now you're gonna add some filling now the original recipe on the website that I found this used buttercream frosting but I didn't think buttercream frosting would be very good so what I did is I used marshmallow fluff instead and then I added some rainbow sprinkles to give it a little extra touch and then you need to roll it up you can roll it up for whichever end that you want to I started from the narrow end and it just roll it all the way up and then you're going to let it harden and then cut it up into slices I put mine in the refrigerator just to hurry up that last portion of the recipe if you cut it into 1-inch thick slices you'll get about a dozen servings per roll and there it is as you can see those little rainbow sprinkles I put on there are completely lost you can't really see them so you don't have to put those in the other thing is I used marshmallow fluff in these and that made them very good they're delicious they taste like fruity rice krispie squares the problem is that they are very messy to eat people were getting marshmallow fluff on their fingers and on their lips and just really messy so I would recommend if you don't want something super messy I would use buttercream frosting in the center as the filling instead hope you give them a try now because Fruity Pebbles have all the colors of the rainbow I've included them into my rainbow playlist where you'll find everything from a rainbow bread to a rainbow cheese cake if you want to see the videos in this playlist go ahead and click right on your screen or see

chocolate bar and break it up for some reason I just feel like it tastes more like a s'mores and rather than using chocolate chips but that's just me but you can use chocolate chips if you want to I do have my oven preheated to 350 I've got a 9 by 13 inch pan lined so it is ready to go I'm gonna make this in a really big pan because I want to lots of room to mix in this pan I'm going to add the butter it's just like making regular crispy treats like rice crispy treats and I'm gonna wait for the butter to melt I want this to be melted before I add my marshmallows that's good enough I'm gonna add all of my mini marshmallows and now I'm just going to stir these around medium-low heat until they're all melted and I tell you what you want to make these ahead of time and then if you want to if you're like a movie GUI pop them into the oven last minute just to melt them than just you know just to melt the chocolate in the marshmallow in the center again you have not lived until you've had that and I know you're wondering what's with the salt have you ever had a campfire right after the beach have you ever made s'mores right after you've come back from the beach where you're still salty from head to toe and you're gonna eat it and your fingers just just kind of happen to lick your fingers along with those s'mores and the saltiness from the water still lingers on your fingers that is what's good about this a little bit of that saltiness it's just that perfect marriage of sweet slightly salty it almost enhances the flavor of the sweet it is fantastic I'm just gonna keep my eye on this until these are melted and then they'll set I'll add the cereal that looks great add your cereal this by the way is why I use a big pot because you need a lot of ring to groove a lot of money to move around I'm just gonna stir this until I feel like this cereal is pretty well coated in the marshmallow mixture all right just adding just about half of it into my 9 by 13 I know it seems like a really thin layer but remember it's really rich and I'm gonna just take a spatula and I dip it in water it really helps spread this out and not stick so just be patient and just spread this out into a thin layer once you have one thin layer it just takes some marshmallows you don't have to add a lot because remember we've got a pretty decent layer of marshmallow goodness here and you just sprinkle this on top and this is a time where you can either go in with chocolate chips or a borrowed chocolate of your choice and I break them up and just scatter them all around and then you just take the remaining and I know it looks like a mess now and you really have to be patient and understand that this needs time to set before you can cut it and have it be the delicious sticky some indulgent just deliciousness I can't stand how the marshmallow makes it so gooey but it is necessary and here's another thing to take clean hands dab them in some water and help have that help you Pat the sin because that's gonna be the easiest way to do it just Pat it all in and it doesn't matter if any of the chocolate is exposed as long as you've got a pretty good layer once you cut these up it's gonna be magical all right see how much better that looks I'm gonna just pop this into the oven at 350 for less than five minutes because I need the chocolate to have a chance just to melt a little bit once I do that I'm going to let these cool completely and set probably about a couple hours or so and then we cut and then we enjoy and you're going to love it benumb I just want to let you know that once these come out of the oven I'm just gonna sprinkle the sea salt on them after they come out of the oven so don't forget to do that because I'm gonna see you back here once they're ready to be cut alright these were setting for a couple of hours and I'm telling you look at this just want you to see the chocolate you see how it's kind of soft like that that's what's so great about using an actual bar of chocolate versus chocolate chips and it still gives you that squidgy texture I'm gonna cut one out cuz I'm gonna cut the rest of them once you're gone oh look at those and when they came out of the oven because remember they only went in there for a couple of minutes long enough to melt the chocolate I sprinkled them with some sea salt and it is so important that you do that because otherwise everything together is so sweet there's nothing to kind of cut that sweetness and should make everything shine and that's where the salt comes in which is why it's so important but look at this look at the squid genus right there I see it oh yeah I can party with that no words delicious easy or perfect someone treat no matter what the occasion no campfire needed remember well squeals and I not friends if you're the same boat as I am girl are in the kitchen and Comp get the recipe and make these inside but no one can get you I mean just ready done with me ask you next time bye bye

will put their channel in the card up here and also down in the description below so basically how this collaboration is gonna work I'm gonna be sharing with you the recipe for these rice krispies treats it's like an Oreo white chocolate rice krispies and it is literally amazing it's my favorite dessert it's easy to make and it tastes amazing and it looks fancy so if you bring this to a Thanksgiving dinner party you're gonna be the cool kid in town so make sure that you pay attention to this recipe and if you want to see how the finished product looks and also how it tastes they will be doing a review on their Friday food review on so there's gonna be the day after Thanksgiving check it out and also if you've tried the recipe be sure to tag us over on Instagram we'll have you say hash tag Melissa and Alex and I will look for some photos of your rice krispies treat cookies and cream white-chocolate yumminess and I hope that I get to see a lot of you guys doing that on Thanksgiving but let's get right into it and here is that recipe so for this recipe you are going to need a quarter cup of butter we'll need 300 grams of marshmallows which is about 3/4 of a pound of marshmallows I usually use a pound of marshmallows I like it extra marshmallowy you also need five cups of rice bubbles or rice krispies treats a total of 10 Oreos one and a half cups of white chocolate chips and then an additional three to four Oreos on the side and that's what you're going to be using for your powder so let's get this started alright there's all of our ingredients we've got a rice krispies treats our Oreo our butter our white chocolate chips and our marshmallows let's get this thing goin all right step one is gonna be to turn on your stove to about a medium to low medium heat trying to burn your house down great good idea once you have that heat going is when you're gonna want to chuck in your butter let that melt I prefer to use a metal spoon for this totally up to you but you're gonna kind of mix the butter up try to get it up on the sides of the pan as well so that it doesn't and stick through the pan is that suck and after you have the butter melted you're gonna throw in the marshmallows and mix those up until it's nice and melted turn the heat off and throw in the rice krispies treats and mix that up mix in your Oreos at this time do the next part is gonna be to put it in the pan I usually use an 8 by 8 pan or something like a square shape because I like my rice krispies treats to be a little bit thicker you can do the small pan if you need more but this is my go-to choice here make sure you spray it with a nonstick spray so that it doesn't stick sadly that's not obvious I don't have to explain it and then you're gonna pour this mixture into the pan okay this could either be really good or really bad here this might not be a very camera friendly thing going on here dump her in take your hands get them wet trust me on the Gideon wet part and Pat this down so it's presentable doesn't look like a second grater me at this okay make sure you wash your hands - okay people we need practice good hygiene wearing gloves does not make your hands magically avoid dirt and germs okay that's press down now okay so now that we finished that part the next step is gonna be to make our white chocolate topping and that's what makes this really really yummy we're gonna pour some melted white chocolate over the top with some crushed Oreos to make it look super fancy you could even go as far as like planing out so like on this one I would say we can make one - we can make nine either six decent-sized ones or nine medium-sized ones or four giant ones but you could take like a full Oreo or happen Oreo stick it in the chocolate and it would look super fancy like that so that's an option as well so let's get this white chocolate sauce made and this is really easy what you're gonna want it's like a small glass bowl something that's microwave safe let me see if I have one else I'm actually gonna use this Pyrex doubles as a measuring unit so I know exactly how many two white chocolate chips I'm using so 1.5 cups of white chocolate so I have this here a deli bag which is 11 ounces so a cup is 8 ounces so we need 12 is 11 I've done this enough times to know that even 11 ounce bag is plenty so take my word for it it's plenty you don't need to worry about doing under on the white chocolate eggs we already went over with the marshmallows so we make it up frame okay okay so we're gonna want to pour the white chocolate chips into our glass look or spill them everywhere this one up to and now what you're gonna want to do is microwave these on 30 seconds mix it up do another 30 mix up then do 15 seconds mix it up until it's a nice runny liquid we're gonna pour it over the top of your rice krispies treats alright so now that that's all nice and liquidy the white chocolate pour it over your mixture and remember with white chocolate do not overdo it 15 20 seconds at a time because it's not real chocolate so it can burn very easily and I've learned this from experience alright so now we're gonna pour it over our mixture it doesn't have to be perfect because you can spread it out with your spoon after you just want it to be kind of spread around enough so that you have to work so hard to get it even then once you have that on there you're just gonna simply spread the white chocolate then you would simply just stick it in there because this chocolate will dry or Harden I should say and again if you want thick chocolate use less Oriya are you guys use less white chocolate chips clearly once that's done I crushed up in a small bag here some Oreos and that's gonna be our topping simply take the Oreos in your hand and sprinkle it on top and that's about it so now after we are done with this we're gonna put this in the refrigerator so that the chocolate can Harden and after that take it out of the pan this is where that nonstick spray will come in handy cut it up and enjoy if you want to see the final product and also the taste review of these rice krispies treats be sure to go over to the

Welcome to American Baker in Germany. I\u2019m Michelle and today we are making one\nof my recipes. This is a family recipe\u2014my mother\u2019s recipe\u2014for\nfrosted chewies. It\u2019s kind of an alternative to Rice Krispie\ntreats. Really delicious. Let\u2019s get started. Not too many ingredients today. We need 6 cups or about 230g of Rice Krispies\nor Corn Flakes. 1 cup or 200g of sugar. 1 cup or 225mL of corn or rice syrup. 1 cup or 235g of peanut butter. 2 to 3 hundred grams of dark or milk chocolate\nto taste. Start out by buttering your baking form really\nwell. Don\u2019t use baking spray here. Butter or margarine. Then add the sugar and syrup to a small pot\nand put it over medium-high heat. Stir it occasionally to ensure it doesn\u2019t\nburn. Heat the sugar until it comes to a good, solid\nboil. Remove the sugar from the heat. Be careful! It\u2019s really hot! Gently stir in the peanut butter until the\npeanut butter melts and the mixture becomes one color. Pour the mixture over the cereal in a large\nbowl. Stir as much together as possible until the\ncereal is completely covered with the sugar/peanut butter mixture. It should now be cool enough to touch without\nburning yourself. Pour the cereal into the prepared form. Butter your hands and press the cereal firmly\ninto the form. Set the mixture aside and let it set up for\na few minutes. In the meantime, melt the chocolate in the\nmicrowave at 50% power for 30 second bursts, stirring in between each one, until the chocolate\nis completely melted. Pour the melted chocolate over the cereal\ntreats and spread it around a bit. You can add more chocolate, if you need more. But this recipe tastes best with just a little\nchocolate along the top, so the chocolate flavor doesn\u2019t overpower the peanut butter. Now the hardest part. Set the treats aside until the chocolate sets\nup. Once it\u2019s ready, you won\u2019t see any wet-looking\nchocolate anymore and you can cut the treats with a knife. Here\u2019s what they look like when they\u2019re\nready. These are sticky and have a mild peanut butter\nflavor. The chocolate just enhances it. These taste amazing and I have to ration them\nso I don\u2019t eat too many in one sitting. I hope you enjoyed the recipe today. If you make these yourself, tag me on Instagram. I would love to see your work. For more cakes and recipes, visit our website\nat AmericanBakerinGermany.com. We\u2019re also on Facebook.

and i love cereal bears from General Mills it's the Count Chocula treats cereal bars are great no ball required no dishes to wash talked about skip to dishes in Canada we have several varieties of cereal bears course the classic rice krispies we have Lucky Charms Golden Grahams Reese's puffs and Cinnamon Toast Crunch but I don't think we have a chocolate cereal bear that's where America comes in the count is in a cereal bar super chocolaty marshmallow dipped in a little bit of chocolate and anytime I can take Syrio on-the-go I like it let's check it can't Chocula treats this how it comes in the package and this is what the Count Chocula cereal bar looks like yep they can't chocolate pieces chocolate chips a chocolate drizzle of course they can't chocolate marshmallow and then just a dip a chop it on the bottom the only sad thing is the MER bits aren't the bets that come in Count Chocula I guess you wouldn't really be able to see them in cereal bar anyway it's smelling very chocolatey if you've ever smelled can Java you know what I'm talking about stuck together with the marshmallow with marshmallows and a lot of chocolate let's check out the can't chocolate treats let's do it oh that's good guys definitely has that chocolate taste from the can Chocula and you do get the corn base cereal chocolate is super sweet super marshmallowy guys this is really good a lot of marshmallow a lot of chocolate and like all cereal bars it has that rice krispies treats texture not exactly mind-blowing here guys but this is absolutely solid I mean it's chocolate cereal and marshmallows and anytime anything has marshmallows it's usually better hmm love the addition of the morsels it's an extra texture so although I think of a camp Chocula treats I'm a massive fan of rice krispie treats you make a chocolate you put marshmallows in it and then some chocolate morsels give me some textures I'm down bronze giving the camp chocolate treats 8.5 out of 10 there south of a very satisfying I got these former snacks Toronto if you're a candle and you want to try a chocolate REITs check the moon pretty sure if they haven't been stocked they'd be glad Hulk you up it's been a quick look at General Mills Count Chocula treats but another quick bra reviews snack safe see you guys next time you", "gpV4L7iaKHU": "hey cake chance and welcome back to another video now as you probably already see from the video title today we're going to be tackling something that i get asked for advice on an awful lot for those of us in the cake community who are big fans of creating more sculpted pieces sometimes it's not always practical to do things with real cake whether that's because it needs to be more gravity defying or whether it's just going to be really small or long and slim as i say sometimes it's just not practical to do it with actual cake now of course you can do it with non-edible things like polystyrene dummies and tinfoil and things like that but personally i'm a bit of a cake snob if i'm going to be making a cake i want all of it or at least as much of it as possible to be completely edible and so if there's something that i can't practically do with cake my material of choice tends to be rice crispy treats also known as rkt now the internet is littered with recipes for rkt or rice krispie treats and so i can imagine it's pretty confusing to know where to start if it's not something you've worked with before so in today's video i'm going to show you the recipe that i follow to make my rice krispie treat mixture and we might even have a go at doing a bit of sculpting as well but as always instead of chatting about it let's get to the video now if you fancy having a go at making some rice krispie treats for sculpting you will need some rice cereal i tend to just use budget store brands rather than the more well-known ones purely just because i think it all tastes the same and it works out a lot cheaper you will also need some marshmallows and i like to use american marshmallows purely because i find that they're a little bit stronger when combined with the rice cereal i'm a vegetarian so i can't actually eat proper marshmallows or in fact my own rice crispy cereal mixture so i have no idea how they taste or how they compare to other types of marshmallows i just know that i found them particularly strong for sculpting i'm sure other ones would be fine as well but these work best for me oh and these are also available at the supermarket i tend to pick them up in the kind of you know the international food aisle so where they have all the like the american style sweets and and all those sorts of things but yes from my local supermarket now a lot of recipes that you find online also call for butter but the butter is when you're making rice cereal treats to eat as just like a snack as a bar and it makes them a little bit softer and kind of easier to bite into and so on which of course when we're sculpting with it isn't really what we want we don't want it to be soft we want it to be nice and strong so my recipe doesn't use any butter at all although you will need some butter just for oiling up your work surfaces and also your hands but i'll show you that in a second when we get started you're also going to need a microwavable bowl i actually have no idea if this one is a microwavable i guess we'll find out and then a nice big bowl for mixing and i tend to just use a big old tupperware box like this one in fact the one i usually use is even bigger but i can't find it at the moment so if any of my family or friends have had a cake from me recently in a giant tupperware box and you've still got it can i have it back please but i think that's pretty much everything other than like some kind of regular tools and things but we'll kind of cover those as we go through but um i think that's pretty much enough intro let's get started so i like to keep things super simple for my rice krispie treat mixture so my recipe is essentially equal parts rice cereal and marshmallow so the first thing we're going to do before we do anything else is weigh out those equal quantities and i've got my digital scales right here now purely based on the size of this bowl here i'm going to do a mix of around 300 grams today so 300 grams of rice cereal and 300 grams of marshmallow [Music] okay and then they get tipped into this giant bowl here and then we're going to do exactly the same thing again with the marshmallow okay and then to melt my marshmallows down i tend to just put them in the microwave if you don't have a microwave you can do it in a large pot on the stove i just prefer the microwave because it's quicker and there's less chance of things burning and very easily distracted so these are going to go in the microwave for about one minute to start with and what you'll find would have happened while they've been in there for that one minute is they will all have expanded and started to kind of melt together in the middle taking a silicone spatula i'm just going to give them a very little stir around the outside and i'll warn you now this is probably the stickiest substance known to man and then they go back into the microwave for another 30 seconds and that's it see what i mean super super quick as i say this is so sticky um so be careful where you put it down and after that extra 30 seconds you'll see that it's almost just kind of melted into one giant mouse which then gets scooped into our bowl of rice krispies these i'm going to put aside and ignore and this we are going to leave for a couple of minutes because that marshmallow i mean i can feel the heat coming off it from up here is so incredibly hot and if you were to put your hands straight into that now you are going to burn yourself so try to resist the temptation of getting started with it leave it for about two minutes and then we're going to get on with mixing okay once that two minutes is up we are going to start to mix them together but do be warned it is still fairly hot so if you're someone who's quite sensitive to heat you might want to wait a little bit longer i'm one of those weird people who kind of almost has developed asbestos fingers over the years so i do tend to go in there probably while it's a little bit too hot but it is what it is as i've already warned you this is probably the stickiest substance known to man so if you just put your hands in there straight as they are you are going to end up covered with marshmallow so what i like to do is take some regular butter and just use that to completely coat my hands i do have a separate pack of butter that i just use for this because i would hate after i've been smearing my hands in the packet for someone to come along and put this on their toast but yes so just some regular butter and what that would do will just provide a slight greasy barrier to stop it all sticking to you it's not perfect though you will see we are going to get very sticky what i would tend to do first is just try and scoop some rice krispies over the marshmallow just because that tends to take some of the stickiness and some of the heat out before we really get into the serious kneading and then really it's just kind of about rotating it around and scooping up all those bits of rice krispie and can you see even with that butter it's already really starting to stick to me okay so i have managed to scoop up most of the rice krispies but not all of them so what i'm now going to do is try as best i can to get as much of this off my hands as i can because i don't want to waste it and then i'm going to wash my hands i have a bowl of hot soapy water right here so i'll do that now and then we're going to take some more butter oil up our hands again and also the work surface and again that's just going to prevent our mixture all getting completely stuck down to the work top and stick to itself instead and then it's a case of just tipping out your rice cereal mixture and then we're going to start to knead this together as much as we can scoop in all these loose bits that fell out when you tipped it out [Music] and you should hopefully end up with one solid big lump of rice cereal mixture now if i was sculpting a really large piece like for example my life-size father christmas which i will link in a video in the top corner is it that side i think it's that side anyway yes i will link the video for my life-size father christmas cake up in that corner there it's quite hard to stick this to a structure because although it sticks to itself incredibly well if you try and stick it something else now it's not going to stick so if that's something you're doing if you're sticking rice krispies onto a structure that you have made what i would then do is melt some more marshmallows in the microwave exactly the same way so one minute stir 30 seconds use i would then brush the marshmallow mixture onto the structure using a silicone spatula not your hands because of course it will be very hot and then you should find that that will allow you to glue your rice crispy treat mixture onto your structure now the way i most often use rice krispie treats or rice cereal treats like this is when i'm making kind of my slightly larger cake toppers like this dog one that you can see here this teddy bear which i quite often use in cakes like this one here or even my pug cakes which you probably have seen before like this one here both the teddy bear and the pug were made from rice cereal treats like this to make those i'll use about half of a batch this size so if i split this in half and then i'll split one of those halves maybe into kind of like a third and two thirds like this you'll find it's still fairly soft at the moment so it's not ready to sculpt with so what i'll then do is just kind of leave those to sit for a little bit before i try and work with them so i'm just going to leave those to sit for about 15 to 20 minutes and then i'll come back and show you how to make the structure for one of my miniature busts like my pugs or my teddy bears okay so it's been about 20 minutes and my rice krispies cereal mixture here is nice and cool and that means i'm in a position where i can now begin to shape it sculpt it what have you now as i say in this video in particular i'm going to be showing you how i create the structure for my mini busts like these ones over here so they're super super simple if you've never tried sculpting with rice krispie treats before this is the perfect first thing to try i guess on that no if you're somebody who's watching this and thinking well why would you use my cereal treats to sculpt why wouldn't you just use cake that's a perfectly valid point to make and in fact i have made miniature busts like these before many times with cake in fact the first couple of times i made cakes with those mini busts on them it was for people's birthday cakes so of course i just made them with cake and in fact i've even included them in competition entries before where the category was that everything had to be made from cake so by all means you can make them from cake but cake is a lot heavier so if you are doing something more like the christmas pug themed cake that i showed you a while ago where you had that really tall cake and then laptop on the top that topper made from cake would be quite heavy it would need structure within the cake to support it whereas with rice krispies actually as long as you don't go too heavy with the decoration with sugar paste fondant or whatever you want to call it you should find you wouldn't need as much support a couple of dowels through the cake would be absolutely plenty um it's also really useful again as i say if you're creating something much larger or something that requires some quite intricate pieces i don't know an example might be if you were creating the tower from paw patrol where you've got the big top that you might do out of cake and then you've got that really thin and then you've got that really thin um whatever you would call the rest of the tower um it wouldn't be practical to make that tiny thing out of cake because why you've got the because by the time you've got the structure inside there's not actually enough room really for cake whereas this is something you could pack around that central support and give you kind of the the size that you need before you've got to decorate it i'm probably not explaining this very well if you have any questions about restaurant drinks as always do head down to the comments and ask away i'm usually loitering in there just after a video goes up and then kind of sporadically following the upload so yeah any questions head down to the comments let me know and while you're down there feel free to give this video a like as well anyway these miniature style toppers that i do you can see are made up from kind of the top part of the body so like the shoulders and the top of the chest and then the head and i tend to make them in two parts so i'll make the shoulders and then i'll make the head and attach them together later on you can do it all in one go but i just find it gives me a little bit more control we'll start with the shoulders and the first thing we want to do is really push this mixture together as tightly as we can the more tightly compacted it is the stronger it's going to be okay and then when it comes to shaping this into kind of the shoulders and the top of the chest one thing you'll notice if you look at my body my shoulders at the back going into my back are almost flat whereas at the front here it comes out more particularly after all of the lockdown baking that i've been doing so when i'm sculpting this i'm going to try and keep one side flatter to form the back part and this side will be more rounded and as i say it's really about pushing it as tightly as you can we're also going to want a flat top because we're going to be putting a head on it and for these sorts of structures over here i don't really tend to worry too much about a neck but if you were doing this for a person you would want to consider that as well okay so i'm fairly happy with that and if i give you a bit of a close-up you can see we've got the flat bottom and then the back is straighter the front is more curved and then a reasonably reasonably flat top that we can then go on to put the head on to make the head exactly the same again we're going to really compact that mixture as tightly as we can and then for something like a pug or a teddy bear i tend to do almost like a flattened oval shape something a little bit like that there um if i'm doing something more like the schnauzer or it has that longer muzzle i might add that on at this point as well so i do that with this one here so it's a very quick version but can you see so for something like the teddy bear or or the pug it's it's very much just that flattened oval shape whereas something more like the schnauzer or another type of animal that has that longer muzzle i will include that when i'm sculpting it from the rice krispies cereal at this stage again it is something that you could add on afterwards but it just it gives it a little bit more strength before you start building things up with the decorations later on now these are almost ready to work with but what you will find will happen is that the longer you leave them the stronger they will get so if you were doing something much bigger where the weight of the top piece going on could push down on that lower piece so again if you're doing almost like a life-size human head and shoulders you might find that you want to give it a bit longer to foam up before you start assembling things together but where these are quite small it's not really something we need to worry about too much now to finish these off and actually turn them into the structure that i will go on to decorate later on to make my miniature busts i use one more thing and that is chocolate ganache now for those of you who don't already know chocolate ganache is basically a combination of chocolate and double or whipping cream that have been combined together to create a smooth kind of creamy blend that is perfect for cake decorating for turning into chocolates for all sorts of applications really now i have some dark chocolate ganache here that i made using dark chocolate and whipping cream and my method for making ganache is over on my website so what i'll do is i'll put a link to that down in the video description rather than take you through that here and now because otherwise this video will end up being hours long but what you will see is that over time ganache goes quite solid and this one i made a couple of days ago so it's probably a little bit thicker than i need it to be right now so i'm just going to pop this in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up slightly and then it will be ready to use so that's just been in the microwave for 20 seconds and then another 10 and it's almost where i want it to be you're kind of looking for about a peanut butter consistency for what we'll be using it for today and this is basically going to first of all be the glue that sticks our sculpture together but it's also going to be used as a coating to give us that kind of flawless finish that we're looking for when we are building that structure to decorate again if you haven't used ganache before this makes a fantastic media for covering your cakes with before you cover them in sugar paste because it allows you to achieve a really really flawless finish giving you the perfect foundation to cover it's also a lot more heat stable than buttercream so if you're finding that you're struggling when working in heat with buttercream i would definitely recommend checking out ganache and don't forget the recipe for my ganache or my kind of technique is down in the video description okay so i'm going to be building my structure onto one of my plastic reusable cake boards from cake tools direct and again if you're interested i can put a link down in the video description the reason i like working on these is purely because they are reusable so i can create my cake topper on here and then when it's finished i can take it off put it onto my cake put the cake board in the dishwasher and it's ready to use next time now to stop my mini bus moving around i'm going to start just by putting a little bit of my ganache ganache even onto the cake board and then putting that kind of shoulders part of the bust straight on top what that would do is kind of almost glue it in place so that as i'm working with my structure or my sculpture it's not going to move around and then it's as simple as taking your spatula or your offset spatula as i'm using and covering your structure here in the same way that you would cover a cake kind of one of the biggest mistakes i see people making when they're using rice krispies for the first time is that they just go straight over them with the sugar paste and of course rice krispies are small round and knobbly so they don't give you that perfect flat finish and as we'll all know when you're covering cakes if the foundation isn't flawless the finish of the sugar paste won't be either it just highlights exactly what is underneath it so by covering this with ganache it will kind of slide into any of those cracks or grooves and give us that nice kind of finish over the top but once it's set we can then cover with sugar paste now don't worry about being too neat at this stage we literally just want to make sure we've filled all those holes and then we need to smooth this now as you'll have seen in most of my cake decorating videos i tend to usually go around my cakes with a very basic cake edge scraper like this one here i think this one's from pme and they cost literally about a pound but this isn't a round cake with straight sides so this isn't going to be useful to me today instead we're going to use one of these flexi smoothers that you've seen me use in videos before usually to do almost like the finishing touches when i'm covering my cakes and what i like about these for covering awkward shapes like this is they are flexible which means i can bend them to match the angle of the cake so i'm just going to go around the edge first of all just to smooth that bottom but when it comes to these curves that's when we're going to basically just hold the smoother with our thumb on one side fingers on the other side and we can bend it and we're just smoothing that ganache down getting rid of any excess to really help us achieve that perfectly neat smooth finish now don't panic that you can see the rice krispies through the ganache that's absolutely fine because of course we are going to carry it on to cover this with sugar paste it just means it will be smooth to the touch and then again don't forget we had that relatively flat top for the head so we want to make sure that's still there but to be honest it's as simple as that that's pretty much ready to go now of course these are really simple structures for really simple sculptures so if you wanted to do anything more complex with this bit here for example having some definition between the arm and the chest you really needed to have done that before you go in with your ganache and then you need to make sure that you use your scraper to keep that definition as you're working you don't want to fill that with ganache because then it will be gone because what you'll find will happen is if you leave this to dry and set that ganache will set nice and hard like it had done in the bowl and then you will have to almost carve in again moving on to the head what i'll do in exactly the same way i did to glue the base to the board is i'll put some ganache on top take the head and place it on top of that ganache and that will just glue it in place now it's not solid yet don't forget you still want to be quite careful at this point or you could leave it for a while and then come back to it before you carry on but then it's exactly the same as we did before we're just going to cover the head with the ganache and then use the flexi smoother to smooth everything down but yeah essentially once you get to this stage you are done that just needs to be satisfied to firm up probably ideally overnight if you can and then it will be ready to cover in your choice of sugar paste or fondant or modelling paste or what have you what you also didn't see is that sneakily off camera i finished off the one with the snout as well so if i put them kind of next to each other you can hopefully see the difference between the two and as i said earlier on in the video this one here is what i use when i'm making things like my pugs or my teddies for my gift of a hug cake in fact why don't i bring them down into shots so you can see this one here is what i use when i'm making things like this teddy here and this one here is what i use when i'm making things like my little schnauzer now of course i'm not going to be decorating these today this was very much to show you how to work with the rice krispie treats but in exciting news i will actually be filming a live tutorial to show you how to go from my chocolate covered rice crispy structure that i've made here today the one with the snail to my miniature schnauzer head over on facebook later this morning so if you're watching this video as soon as it's gone up in about an hour's time i will be in the incredible india cake magazine facebook group demonstrating how to make this adorable miniature schnauzer cake bust so if you fancy checking that out you can of course come and join us live and i will put the link to the facebook group in the video description but once it is finished once the video is done of course it will remain available so i will then pop back and change it to the perma link i think is the term so that you can go and watch it as and when you are ready now just before i go i did also want to add almost like a bit of a ps where i show you that when you are working with rice krispie treats like these it's not only about creating kind of organic shapes like these ones they are also absolutely brilliant for carving as well so if you need to do something that's quite defined um a car cake or a car cake topper are probably the best examples of something that you might need to be really really square and accurate rice krispies treats are absolutely brilliant for carving so if you have a really sharp knife and i tend to prefer one with a thin blade and serrations you can saw through your rice crispy mixture and can you see it gives you a perfectly flat surface that again you can go on to cover with your ganache and that will help you making things like cars or even buildings anything really that you can think of that needs to be really perfectly geometric that's probably the best word to use but anyway guys that is how i make my rice cereal mixture when i am using it to create my miniature sculpted cake toppers i do hope that some of you found this useful and as i said earlier on in the video if you have any questions about working with rice cereal mixture or rice krispie treats or rkt or whatever you prefer to call it then please do head down to the comments and ask away because i will be only too happy to help and of course if i can't answer

have any way of controlling where the chocolate goes when you do that or just kind of goes everywhere and hope for the best I am controlling yeah yeah doing that like do you can you predict like where it's gonna go yeah do you have to practice there like does it yeah it takes practice yeah took in the beginning when you first did it just kind of went everywhere and you like no no now over there over here is just kind of like depend on where how you like angle it when you're banging it on the table yes you got it Wow genius yeah crack the code how many other ways can you say that you done did it Wow it just keeps coming mm-hmm look this warm-up the chocolate it's on the table that'll loosen that up a little bit we'll add some nice crispy hmm good one dad here comes your mom got an intruder intruder intruder let's get a pretty new alarm system you can see me mm-hmm our alarm system is only 60 something years old what what how much cream does it take to make a batch of truffles do use a whole carton or a half a curtain four flavors so you're gonna need two more I must ask you but then I went to bj's and didn't ask you it slipped my mind I don't have a flip phone I have an iPhone ste yeah I have the lowest edition of an iPhone you can get the flip phone so do you know how to you dead walked into my room the other day and was like what what's the button to turn this on again let's go actually it's the red button but on the right yeah but here's a con what thought was the green wanna thing yeah I did do when I first well it makes sense yeah this is still 97 degrees I'm out of here it's getting very close to the lip here it is it's to the lip it will tip have a drip I should take a sit now I'm very pretty giving it up for a lot I have more packages to open I'll do that oh that's why I'm gonna make a trip I'm gonna try not to trip upstairs I mean yes gonna flip down we are really good with it if rhymes aren't we better zip okay right here Steve just so you know I'm cooked out I got you know these rugs that curl that we don't like so when they curl we chop them off ya know what happened here see ya [Laughter] uline and it's supposed to be nine curling so we'll see nine curl and rugs I mean these whatever these are made all over not curly we're about to enter the 22nd century no they don't fly mm-hm you just don't curl but if we do get these bigger boat tank it is bigger right yeah hey hurry back Matt oh god I'm just kiddin see this no she won't oh wow you know I didn't think about that way she won't care I don't know she might she might decrease your beer rations for the week [Laughter] so when you're cleaning off your hand with a knife do you have to do any differently when you have clusters of anything in the chocolate like these Rice Krispies or knots or anything when I clean off my hand it's so that chocolate won't crystallize on my hand because it's warm otherwise I guess definitely glove no just the warm-up it'll warm up the chocolate we don't want to watch chakra to get one don't we wanted to cool off [Music] yeah yeah then that's awful what if it crystalizes we can sell crystals I know genius huh yeah chocolate crystal oh well that's all that work India's it's chocolate crystals all together okay ready mm-hmm welcome when you I bring it over to the candy bar you're like still moving up and down even on the way over a pad cuz I want to get it going early okay and so why do you why do you have to do that when you're putting it in the bar otherwise I'll stick to my hand so cold outside by moving your hand up and down it drops out easier doing it in the refrigerator for about a half-hour and they're all set yeah trying to explain to everybody why you say while on to the wha cuz that's why I'm mom said the you said that it just sounds better that's the way I've always said it how you say it and I think it's French and useful save voila wah-wah-wah-wah I thought I was funny that mom's like yeah he knows that supposed to be viola he just like wow a lot better yeah I like it yeah so that's what I say we should have a shirt a dead thing Wawa wal lah or wo ila because kind of wah but just W the last candy bar just enough yep Wow no you bento be nice I've been doing this a while so today we are doing the milk Rice Krispies bars and they look like an ordinary milk drop the bar from this angle but wait huh there's more that's a lot of rice krispies there's a lot of days I know well you know we don't like to squander on the goods here you got to give the people what they want so we're gonna lay it down just so and because this isn't the perfect size square that we need we got to make it pretty so I usually pull just a little bit there and fold it over and it's it's bumpy because of the rice crisps but that's okay that's a good thing Oh see and I didn't like Estimator gonna make it pretty and then because we don't want the white inside to show you know so what I like to do is fold it over kinda like you're folding a present and then fold it in and then it's all a golden a pretty yeah so I'm gonna do the same thing to the other side like is that see yeah this stuff looks kind of messy but I'm gonna do another one and then I'll show you what we do after okay all right so turquoise isn't this just the most beautiful ever love it it's very shiny and bright and it makes me happy anytime that sounds happy I know and it makes me think spring which is coming soon yeah I'm excited for that I'm excited for just in that winter oh I hate layers hate winter okay mm-hmm so we got that that's gonna call pretty weird to the other side and fold it like this so now once we get those all done I'll do a bun we take our handy-dandy cloth and we just smooth out the edges so you do like the outside first I do the outside first I don't know how other people do it this is what I do because that way we get the bubbles out at the top and the sides and then we just smooth fabulous so now we have this beauteous shiny turquoise milk chocolate rice krispies donner nice it's got like a little breaking points I know so you know just in case any of you felt compelled to share your chocolate that's good for that mm-hmm we had a couple in here yesterday who got the candy bar and they were like oh look it's in Breaking Point we could share it and then the wife put it in her pocket yeah and I said she might not share it with you yeah probably pretty accurate well you know it's hard to tear a woman away from her chocolate I'm just saying I have to remember that isn't that gorgeous yes so then we're gonna weigh them and see how much they weigh and we're gonna pull a little sticker on the back with how much they weigh we need the new one hah I'm gonna use the new one yeah the new scale which is behind you yeah so let's go check it out so anything that doesn't have to be doesn't have to like stay completely upright can be used on this one right I can use stuff that stays completely upright cuz yesterday I did but I did I did not Club I did vegan pecan Buster's so you get the bag to stand up on here it's fabulous and when you're doing stuff like this it's awesome because I'm gonna put it on bounces mmm just put it on see that it's one point four so that's one point two five ounces and you can slide that baby off and do the next one and this one is one point two ounces and so you just slide it off scale throw the next one slide it off so it's a lot faster it's a lot like it I can tell so we need put a label on this and I probably should've got those out before we started um I'm gonna go ask because I've never actually wrapped these before we found okay so the blue one was 1.25 ounces one point two fat and the gold was cuz it's one point two we're usually round to like one ounce because it's kind of like halfway in between so we had to be careful to put this on because sometimes it's a little wide mm-hmm so we're gonna put that right in the middle get that on there real careful because of all the rice krispies and we don't want to rip the foil because I might have to start all over again yeah can't have that I got too many things to do is coming keep it real all right so there we have rice krispies and if you want a little demonstration of the new barcode I do I know about these people that I do this is awesome it is really really nice because you can adjust the size of the barcode if you need it um doo-doo-doo-doo rice krispies I'm just gonna do rice krispies yeah oh look at that came right to what I need milk rice krispies bar zero zero two three men so we're gonna bring up our label zero zero two three nine yes please and I'm just gonna print a couple for demonstration purposes only mm-hmm and hit print no that's good I know he's beautiful and because they're nice and narrow they scan really really nice yeah but it's getting better too yeah it's just all around better view all around better we love it so we're gonna put that over here because it's a smaller bar where we got to make sure everything fits mm-hmm this one over here on this side and the last thing we'll do is the best by date yeah Hercules candies Ramon you really want to talk to me yeah all right so these are what month are we in I almost tricked myself which means after today there's only 13 days before Valentine's Day so guys you need to get in here and get your ladies some goodies yeah it's usually the guys that are super last-minute and the women are the ones who are getting stuff now yes yes all right so these because they're solid chocolate these are good for oh I forgot to change the year no good for a year oh wait that is a nine it didn't look like a nine all right it is a nightmare yeah it's 2019 right yes so right put that right there and that one right there and here we have these gorgeous Rice Krispies milk chocolate bars that are waiting for you to try them if you yeah can we show them where they'll be in store if they think you are close

which are awesome if you like Oreos I am a peanutbutter person so I prefer the peanut versa but here we go Rice Krispies just like that [Music]", "JVJrDb2ulUE": "[Music] hi and welcome to being a British chef and beyond I am Amrita Wrightson and it gives me great pleasure to create a recipe for a guru yesterday is teachers day and I think it's just imperative that we create something wonderful that befits our teacher so I thought when we are making something for teachers day let's give the teachers the strength that they need to handle so many students right of course it takes a lot of energy a lot of patience to be able to teach so today's recipe is going to help our teachers with just that let's begin making some yummy granola bars so let's begin now this recipe I have created with keeping children in mind I mean if it's teachers they technically should not the children cook for their teachers right so this is a very very easy recipe all that has to be done is take all these healthy nuts and seeds and toast them okay so I've got some walnuts in a pan and then I'm going to add some seeds which are pumpkin and sesame and some muskmelon seeds in it I've got some cut almonds as well now these nuts are going to take a little while to toast but mind you they have to be toasted on very very low temperature obviously as a parent you're going to help the child do this I don't advise children go near the fire so I'm going to allow this to toast then I'm going to add another ingredient to it but that doesn't take too long to get toasted so that we go after about four to five minutes in the meantime I will show you how you can melt chocolate through the help of a double boiler method so you have a bowl you have a saucepan like this what you're going to do is you're going to pour some water in the saucepan first and you have to make sure that it is not very high the water should not touch the base of this bowl so I can go a little and then we're gonna add the chopped chocolate to this always chopped you're cooking chocolate because then the melting happens evenly okay now I'm gonna pick up this entire setup and I'm gonna place it on another flame again on low flame so what's gonna happen the chocolate is going to melt with the heat of the steam that comes out of the water that we have added into the pan now I better often use the microwave also to melt chocolate it's a little quicker and you don't have to keep paying attention to it but people who don't have a microwave at home this is the best method this is actually the correct method we just take the easier way out all right so now let's look at our nuts they seem like they are toasted and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add some oats so I use gluten free oats and what they're gonna do is they're going to add the much-needed fiber to a granola bus all right so let's check the status of our chocolate here chocolate has started melting right now here my chocolate is done as you can see it's beautifully melted you have to be careful while melting chocolate you should constantly keep stirring it because at no point do you want it to get burnt or seized right and then here I have turned my other pan as well off my nuts are nicely toasted and I can get a nice nutty flavor you can see that the oats are cooked as well they've changed their color from white they have become a nice golden brown color this is done again how do you check if the chocolate is of the correct temperature you just touch it to your lower lip like this still a little hot mmm it's also a good way of licking the chocolate away so I'm just gonna bring it down to room temperature the moment you don't feel the heat on your lower lip because that's a very sensitive part of your body you know that the chocolate is at the right temperature all right so come on now it's time to do the mix mix mix so I'm going to add the nuts and the seeds and oats to this mixture alright so the nuts in the seeds and the oats have been added now let's make it even healthier and a little more Gruyere by adding some chopped dates to this okay now what the dates will also do along with the chocolate is bring the entire granola bar together and keep it together well alright now this is done and now we are going to put this inner platter like this or you can set it on an aluminum tray as well but this is a pretty platter so I chose to use this now we need to flatten this whole mixture out right till the edges and the small crevices that may be left behind try and cover that with the help of your spatula or you can use a you know flat spoon as well seems like this is done just now a little while in the fridge for it to get set properly and then you're gonna start slicing them so one hour or two are it should be ready to cut right now this is set I am going to take the cling wrap out that is why putting a cling wrap on the base is very very important and helpful because you can take it out very easily too alright so now we're gonna place this on our chopping board and with the help of a knife we are going to cut this all right now I am going to place the ones that have not broken neatly on a plate but I will advise you if children are going to make this and present it to the teachers I would like them to cover it in colorful cellophane papers wrap it and give it so that they can carry it to school and when the children are driving the mat they bite into one of these and they're going to be done for the moment so on that happy note and a healthy note very happy teachers day please do respect your teachers because we all are what we are today thanks to Uncle rules thanks to our teachers also don't forget to subscribe to being a Maratha Shep and beyond after all like I mentioned earlier I'm also your teacher right so I hope you continue watching my youtube channel and keep sharing the love and sharing the joy with all your friends and family I will see you very soon [Music]",

mixing bowl this recipe is stupid simple guys it's about as simple as getting your personal training certificate laughably easy and you're in no way qualified first thing we do set our mixing bowl on our food scale and grab a container of fat-free plain greek yogurt we need 112 grams and make sure when you're buying greek yogurt that you're buying the plain unflavored next up we need 13 grams of jet puffed marshmallow cream this is really going to help give it that marshmallow flavor that we all know and love she's a little sticky though next up we need 112 grams of fat-free cream cheese this will mix better if you let it get to room temperature but it ain't a necessity but don't overthink it man just make the recipe build muscle burn fat grow beer live anabolic [Music] now we just need 77 grams of a vanilla based whey protein powder as always i'm using that final boss baby which is now actually back in stock so you better get it for a sold out bud i don't need any more angry dms available at bobas horns.com.com two days shipping rgf10 you know it now we just need 10 grams of a zero calorie sweetener zero calories no side effects except for ab veins that's the only one and i really think that's a side effect we can all live with [Music] now we just want to go in with a spoon and slowly mix all this together and once you're done mixing our batter should be creamy smooth and look like this at this point we're practically done we just got a couple more steps it wouldn't be rice krispie treats without some crispy rice cereal you don't need no name brand i just got the most generic cheapest box i can find i mean it's all the same really i don't feel like the list of directions on making crispy rice cereals a very long one could be wrong though so in our mixing bowl we're just going to weigh out 70 grams telling you man this stuff's light too you get a lot of rice krispies for not a lot of weight and once again we're going to grab our spoon get down in here and start mixing everything together and the goal here we want every single rice krispie to be coated in our little batter i'm telling you guys just wait till you try these man it's going to bring you all the way back to dexter's lab in dragon ball z or maybe hey arnold if you had a bad childhood [Music] and now that our rice krispies are all mixed up we're just gonna grab a small square cake pan hit it with some nonstick and then spoon our mixture right down in here and now you'll just take your spoon and flatten it out until it molds into this pan depending on the size of pan you use they could be bigger they could be smaller a little thinner a little wider doesn't really matter at the end of the day though bud they're all going to eat the same and once you got them all spread out it should fit in your pan perfectly and look like this [Music] now i'm just to wrap it in plastic wrap boom boom boom boom and now we just want to put it in the fridge to chill for two three hours let it firm up a little bit it's a little sticky right now we need to firm so i'll just put it right in here boom but don't you worry man i'm not gonna make you wait i got one right here that i prepped in advance let's finish up so all i want to do is cut this into four different treats let's go right down the middle boom then we'll go down the middle again now we just go back in our mixing bowl and weigh out 30 more grams of rice krispies cereal and then just take your rice krispie treat put it down in here move it around a little bit hey look at that man those rice krispies stick right to it gorgeous baby and rinse and repeat for the rest of your rice krispies [Music] so [Music] and boom guys our anabolic rice krispie treats are done you might notice i got two out now because i'm gonna eat them

are banging bub oh my gosh and if they're this good like this imagine them frozen oh i think this is better than the rice krispies i used to keep but the adventist disease though is that there's no sugar almost zero fat in their anabolic they're gonna help us towards our goals man when people ask you what you eat on your diet i want you to say rice krispies i want you to say cheesecake i want you to say pizza and i want their jaws to hit the floor all these cases right now with this pandemic i want to see cases of people's jaws dislocating and hitting the floor because people still don't think you can eat like this and see results man but we're here to prove them wrong this is way better than it has any right to be you got to make this you got chad on instagram let me know what you think man this is just absolutely incredible and when i tell you the macros you might just call me crazy because this shouldn't be possible for what we're doing here that is just picturesque bud

is way better than that bud i give this one an a plus hands down a plus 100 you're going to college not that goofy community one either bud we're getting you into harvard so in this entire recipe if you make it exactly how i did it exact same measurements everything what you end up with the whole thing is 2 grams of fat 90 grams of protein 132 grams of carbs zero fiber so if you do what i did you split it into four different treats you could obviously make a you can make 16 however you want to do it bud but if you do what i did each of these big rice krispies is half a gram of fat 23 grams of protein 33 grams of carbs not too shabby man i mean that's legit better macros than a protein bar so you can either go buy a box of protein bars you can whip these guys up at home enjoy them cover

you how to make chocolate dipped strawberry rice krispies treats and because it's almost Valentine's Day of course I have to make them in the shape of hearts but first a little fact did you know that the chocolate dipped shari was actually invented by a woman working in chicago in 1960 who knew all right first up you're gonna need 10 cups or 280 grams or Wrights Krispies cereal you want to avoid using the cheaper low end brands because that will actually make your rice krispies treats come out still tasting I don't know what it is why it does it but it just does next you're gonna need 20 ounces or 570 grams of mini marshmallows I prefer the mini marshmallows because it doesn't take us long to melt but you can use whatever marshmallows you want as long as it's 20 ounces next you're gonna need one stick or 113 grams of salted butter the butter can be at room temperature or cold it doesn't really matter and lastly you're gonna need a three ounce packet of strawberry jell-o mix you don't have to use the whole packet but I prefer two now I did forget to show the 9 by 13 pan lined with parchment paper so don't forget to do that go ahead and grab your giant pot out and start melting your butter and while that melts did you know that Cadbury branch Auklet started the trend of chocolates for Valentine's Day in 1861 by adding chocolate to decorated heart-shaped boxes once the butter is all melted go ahead and pour in the marshmallows and stir them up to get the marshmallows coated with that butter and as you melt the marshmallows make sure that you keep stirring and scraping the bottom of that pot otherwise the marshmallow is gonna start sticking to the bottom and possibly burn and you don't want burnt marshmallows now once that all those marshmallows are pretty much melted you're gonna go ahead and add in your strawberry jell-o mix and make sure you get that stirred up really good so that way you don't have clumps of strawberry mix somewhere might make the rice krispies taste weird next you're gonna go ahead and pour your marshmallow strawberry mix and to a bowl make sure the bowl is really large and already has your Rice Krispies in there and then make sure you scrape the bottom of that bowl really good so that way you don't leave any marshmallow bits behind now get your parchment lined pan out and go ahead and dump the rice krispies mix in there and then you're gonna take the spatula or your hand and press down on the rice krispies and make sure you smooth it all out if you use your hand make sure you wet your hand down just a little tip and then you're gonna go ahead and let that sit for a little while but maybe about an hour once the rice krispies treats are ready go ahead and pull the whole parchment sheet out of the pan and get your heart shaped cookie cutter out and then just cut away now I got nine hearts but how many you gets gonna depend on the size of your cookie cutter once you run out of space go ahead and pull all the hearts out and all those scraps and bits you have leftover don't worry I'll show you here in just a little bit what to do with them okay now for the scraps lay out some parchment paper don't use a bowl like me I learned too late to not usable you're gonna cut the scraps into small bite-sized pieces if the chunk you're cutting is a little too wonky shape go ahead and like squish it into a more manageable shape to cut and then just chop all the scraps up and then lay all the pieces out on the parchment paper again don't use a bowl like I did all right chocolate time admittedly I am terrible about measuring out chocolate when it's for dipping so with that said just try melting about a cup or 170 grams of milk chocolate if you need more you can always melt more easily now you're gonna take each heart and then dip it into the chocolate if it's not smooth on the top like how mine weren't you can just take a spatula and then just kind of smooth it all out this is why I said to put it on parchment paper and not in a bowl because then you're gonna have to like yank it out of the bowl and it just doesn't work very well it's all stuck together so go ahead and get those pieces out any leftover chocolate you have you're gonna grab a fork and you're just gonna like drizzle it flick it fling it whatever all over your chocolate pieces and then there you go chocolate drizzled strawberry right crispy treat bite-sized pieces you can just let that sit somewhere and let the chocolate set there you go chocolate dipped strawberry rice crispy treats perfect treat for Valentine's Day whether you give it to friends family loved ones yourself whatever now one last fun fact during World War two chocolate was provided as rations for soldiers and some of those chocolate bars have actually been found in recent years in the belongings of the soldiers after they've passed away now that's some old chocolate not sure I'd really want to eat that all right I hope you all have a happy Valentine's Day and stay sweet always remember to celebrate food see you next week but in 1960 the strawberry dipped in", "qvFZl-td4AA": "hello ellos neighbor watch another round of cooking of gravy adjacent

it's kelsey your program coordinator today we're going to be making a snack we're going to be making cereal treat bars um but before we do any cooking activities we're going to wash our hands i'm going to sing the happy birthday song two times through while washing my hands now that we've washed our hands let's go over what we're going to need for today's activity we're going to need a microwave safe bowl a one cup measuring cup if you have another measuring cup you can go ahead and grab that just so you have two a knife to cut the butter wax paper for later on when you line your pan cooking spray for when you put the crispy treats on the pan a cookie sheet that you will put the rice krispie treats on we have a spoon that we'll use to mix our rice krispie treats a spatula that we'll use to help flatten it if we need to and then we have our food items we have our favorite cereal here i chose cocoa crispy rice cereal we have a stick of butter and i chose to use mini marshmallows to begin we're gonna measure our marshmallows and our butter to put them in the microwave so for this recipe you're going to need 4 cups of miniature marshmallows or about a whole bag of regular size marshmallows so i have my marshmallows we're going to use this measuring cup here and if you see right on the side we're going to fill it up to this four cups line right there all right so we have four cups of marshmallows we're gonna pour it in our big bowl this is our microwave safe bowl and then we need three tablespoons of butter right on the side of your butter packaging there should be little lines that tell you how many tablespoons so we're gonna use three tablespoons of butter one two and three and these just go right into your marshmallows all right so now that we've measured our marshmallows and our butter we're going to take it to the microwave we're going to take our microwave safe bowl with the marshmallows and the butter and we're going to put it in the microwave and we are going to add one minute to the clock on the microwave and then after that minute i'm going to take the marshmallows out and mix them we'll see you guys back in a minute okay we have a couple seconds left so as soon as this goes off we're going to bring out the bowl be very careful the bowl may be hot and you also don't want to spill anything that has melted all right so our bowl is not too hot all right we're going to give it a mix to see how well everything is melting this is looking pretty good all right so it does look like it could use a little bit more time in the microwave so we're going to take our marshmallows and our butter and put it in the microwave for another one minute all right we'll see you back in another minute all right so we microwaved our marshmallows and butter for about two minutes in total um so it didn't take the full three minutes so just make sure you're paying attention and make sure you don't overheat the marshmallows so as you can see here we have a nice not too liquidy um mix of the marshmallow and the butter so that's nice and mixed we are going to now measure out our cereal so you're going to need six cups of cereal i chose cocoa crispy rice and if you're paying attention to the july virtual programming calendar you can save your cereal box for an activity coming later this month so i'm going to set mine right aside here and then we're going to measure out our cereal i'm going to use a one cup measuring cup and i'm just going to add two cups of cereal at a time just to make sure everything gets evenly coated by the marshmallow we'll start with one cup and two cups i'm gonna set my measuring cup and my cereal aside and i'm gonna stir this up a little bit looks like i can add some more cereal i'm gonna get my one cup measuring cup again i'm going to add two more cups of cereal one and two all right let's give this another mix we just want to make sure everything is evenly coated by the marshmallow all right so i think we can go ahead and add about one more cup of cereal i don't think that i'm going to use the full six cups because i don't want my cereal bars to be dry i like them a little bit more marshmallowy so i'm just going to add one more cup but if you like yours not as marshmallowy you can do two more cups all right so that's my last cup of cereal added and i'm going to give it a good stir i'm gonna make sure all of this is evenly coated and then i will meet you guys back to put the cereal bars on the tray all right our cereal bars are all mixed the marshmallow the butter and the cereal now we're going to line our sheet pan you can use a cake pan you can use muffin tins if you want to make little circles any type of pan you want to use you can go ahead and throw the rice cereal in there and i'll show you how to do that i'm going to line our pan with wax paper we're gonna measure that out and then i'm also gonna give it a little spray of olive oil just to make extra sure that it doesn't stick now we're going to scoop our cereal bars onto the pan make sure you get everything out of the bowl make sure we don't waste any cereal all right all right so now that we have it on the pan you can use your spoon you can use a spatula if you want i did grab a spatula just in case so you can flatten out the cereal make sure you cover the pan as much as you can make it in any shape that you want all right and then whenever you have it all flattened out on the pan you're gonna put the pan in the refrigerator or just let it sit on the counter you're gonna let it cool off for a while and then whenever it's cold and you're ready to have a snack you can cut them up and eat your cereal bars we left our rice krispie treats in the refrigerator for about 20 to 30 minutes and now they are cooled down a little bit more hard and ready to cut i'm going to cut this first row cut them as big or as small as you want and then once you're done cutting your treats will be ready to eat alright so once you're done cutting up your snack once you eat your snack make sure that you put away all of your supplies wash any dishes that need washed make sure you put anything that needs refrigerated back into your refrigerator and i hope you guys enjoy the rest of your day we'll see you next time", "8MuAV38S3U4": "it's Jennifer and it is time for me to make more food to make you guys hungry so this week we are making cheerio treats this is one of my mom's recipes that I don't know where she got it but she makes it all the time I love it and now my son just devours it it's a great snack for the kids it's similar to Rice Krispies bars but just a little bit more ingredients so what you guys would need is you need butter marshmallows peanut butter Cheerios and raisins and then you guys would need a 13 by 9 inch pan so what we're gonna do right now is we're gonna need four tablespoons of butter and a 16 ounce bag of marshmallows so what I'm gonna do right now is melt the butter and then add the marshmallows okay so I got the four tablespoons of butter so you're just gonna let that melt completely and then once it's melted completely we will add the marshmallows we will add the whole bag of marshmallows and mix those in together so let me just mix this up first and then we'll see what takes us from there okay so the butter is completely melted I put some marshmallows in there I don't like putting all the marshmallows in at once because I wanted to try to get them all buttery so they don't like stick everywhere and you can use a smaller batch of butter and you can use a smaller batch of everything else but I like to go big you know these my son loves them and this is a great snack for him it might not be the healthiest but it's a good snack for him so you guys are gonna let this melt completely where it's nice and smooth and then we add 1/2 a cup of peanut butter and 1 cup of raisins so I'm gonna get that prepared while this is melted marshmallows that all are the there's one in there okay okay so the marshmallows are almost all the way completely melted you want to have this low so it doesn't really burn to the bottom of the pan and then so you don't burn your marshmallows I've actually done that in the past where I've burned the marshmallows and then you got a nice burnt taste which is not very appetizing but you want to make sure that the marshmallows are all the way completely melted there are some lumps in here so just stir it up you know you want to make it nice and smooth look at that okay so it looks like we almost got just a couple more marshmallows left to melt and yeah so you're just gonna make sure this is that low and then what you guys need is a half a cup of peanut butter now I use smooth it doesn't matter I don't know if you could use chunky if you wanted to but smooth might be a little bit better unless you want to take taste chunks of peanut butter but yeah and then what we're gonna do is this mix this in a little bit and then we're gonna add a cup of raisins so okay so we're gonna mix up it's all peanut buttery if you guys ever made something like this you know it's cool I don't know where she found this recipe yet I will put the recipe down below unless I can find it on Pinterest then I can just add a link but yes you guys want to make sure that the peanut butter is all the way completely blended so you want to have a nice brown look and still continue to have this low the heat on low and then when we add the marshmallows you want to take it off the heat completely so and my son's playing with my phone okay so this is pretty much really blended together there is a chunk of marshmallows still but that's okay it was on the bottom of this spoon so now what we're gonna add is a whole cup of raisins if you like a lot of raisins you can add more I added just a little bit more than a cup but that's okay so what you're gonna do is just mix in the raisins and you want to kind of get them all spread apart you don't have like chunks of raisins so when you break them when you put them like when you measure them just kind of spread them apart so they're not like all sticking to once and they will spread apart a little bit as you add the Cheerios but it's good so we got that all mixed up and then now we're gonna add six cups of Cheerios so I haven't gotten those ready but um I'll get those ready right now okay so you're gonna take this completely off the heat after B right before you add the peanut butter so what you guys will need is six cups of regular Cheerios this is two cups right here so I'm just gonna kind of stir it and pre-prepared your hand you will have to use your hands and a little bit so you will get Ziggy the best thing I've learned is get your hands full of butter sorry if he is shaking it so there's six cups so then you're gonna just completely stir and stir and stir until all the Cheerios it's covered with marshmallows and peanut butter and raisins and then what your guys are gonna do is get your pan ready and butter it you can butter it um I used to use margarine and butter it but I think I'm just gonna spray it or I'll take some butter just completely line it up because then it doesn't stick to the pan when you're taking them out so we're gonna just keep stirring and stirring and stirring this looks so good and it's so easy to make you know this is like taking me maybe ten minutes to make you know I keep trying not I don't like making this but yeah so okay so what I did is I just ended up just spraying the pan cuz I don't hit kid margarine on me and then what you guys are gonna do is you can either just pour or scoop it right on there and then you want to let this kind of cool off as much as you can before you serve it it is hot right now so my son has just discovered the pots and pans cabinet Thank You Ben thank you thank you for your help so yeah and then we'll do is let this I'll put this all in the pan and then show you guys what to do next okay so what I did is I ended up just taking some butter and getting my hands all buttery because what you guys want to do is you're gonna want to press down on the pan and make it all nice and even you don't have to use the butter on your hands if you don't want to but your hands are gonna be a lot more stickier so you're just gonna kind of just press down and try to get all the corners filled my mom does this so much better than I do thank you okay so that's pretty much that you know that's what it looks like so we're gonna do is just let this out and then we'll dig in okay so they've been sitting around for a while my son had to eat some so just cut them in whatever besides you guys want to cut them I kind of small because on my son he needs they're good little finger foods for him but yeah these are awesome they turned out perfect and I like I said I'll put the recipe down below if you guys did enjoy this video give it a thumbs up if you

another edition of foodie friday with the cocoa queen thanks so much for joining me today so our white chocolate peppermint bars have been extremely popular very tasty and i wanted to do something fun with today to show that you can eat them of course straight out of the box but lots of other fun things you can do with them so any guess what we're making today i bet you can guess you see the classic ingredients for marshmallow treats aka rice rice krispie treats don't sue me um and so that is what we're going to be making today kicking up a notch with some white chocolate peppermint bars mixed in yes who is ready for holiday flavors so before we get started let me introduce myself so i am jen pierce better known as the cocoa queen not just because i wear a crown but because i'm absolutely obsessed with everything chocolate and cocoa and thank goodness for me i found this company called the cocoa exchange that is just as obsessed as i am literally all of their products contain either chocolate or cocoa it's fantastic and so i come to you every friday usually at five o'clock i'm early today um with a new recipe using these products from the cocoa exchange so thanks so much for joining me all right so i already found going on the stove by three tablespoons of butter so those are nice and melted now so i'm gonna throw in my bag of mini marshmallows i like to do the minis because they um i feel like they cook down faster and so i just like that so we're gonna throw those in there and then i've got about five of my white chocolate peppermint bars come in nice pretty box and i've broken those up a little bit i'm gonna throw them in the microwave you find the button for 30 seconds to get those going you'll probably need to be in for longer than that but always when you are microwaving your chocolate you want to do it in 30 second intervals or less so you don't burn it okay and we don't want to burn our marshmallows either so you want to keep an eye on them and keep mixing there so let me know do you love marshmallow treats my husband does he is an absolute freak anytime i make these i have to get the family size box so that i can make gigantic marshmallow treats um because he will eat them in about a day all right so we are not melted at all here we gotta keep going longer keep stirring our marshmallows so you can make this recipe in one of two different ways so you can do it the way we're doing which is i'm gonna incorporate the white chocolate right into our rice krispie treats or you could do it where you melt your chocolate and kind of layer it on top kind of as an icing so either way works equally well and of course you can do this not only with these white chocolate bars but also with really any chocolate any good melting chocolate so our dark chocolate so we're starting to get melting there our dark chocolate chef series bars would be excellent for this what do you think you would like what would go good um in some marshmallow treats what kind of chocolate do you think you would put in there we're getting our marshmallow going has anybody not made rice krispie treats before that would be interesting i probably haven't made them in a year because my husband has been gone so it's probably been quite a while since i've made them so i've also prepped my pan that i'm going to put into and um so i am just like parchment paper in the pan you can um just coat it with any kind of butter or or um oil or shortening or anything uh because obviously we're using marshmallow and this is going to get very sticky okay so i've got my white chocolate peppermint here and it smells so good you guys smell so good i think my marshmallow is almost ready so close and we're gonna pull this all together and you're gonna see how quick and easy this was as well super quick and easy i'm a little bit of a perfectionist i don't like any lumps in my marshmallows not that i have ever gotten any complaints so i normally go live at 5 00 p.m today i'm a little bit early because i need to meet a friend for her birthday in a bit so uh hi kimba if you are out there we've got our marshmallow here i'm gonna pour it into our rice krispie treats okay all has to be done pretty quick at this point before anything starts melting so i've also got my white chocolate i'm gonna add right in there with the rest yep yum yum yum [Music] and now i have two spatulas that i don't know what to do with oh this is always such a mess right rice krispie treats so of course you want to try to fold them in there so it's to not break all of your cereal treat if you guys could smell the peppermint and you want to do it quickly [Music] try to get all your marshmallow it always wants to stick to the bowl everything else there we go i'm seeing my peppermint in there a little peppermint chunks oh boy do i smell it just smells so good all right let's get them all all right when you think you are pretty good and mixed then we are going to transfer to our pan but definitely make sure you've got it coded in some way shape or form or you will regret it and this is just a fun way to elevate your rice krispie treats to another level so if you're having any kind of holiday party this would definitely be fun for that i don't want to leave all that behind in the bowl didn't want to come out this is the kind of thing you shouldn't mess with while you're live on tv you should mess with after the camera goes off again all right and i'm just gonna press it down a little trick here i like to use a silicone spatula because that works the best i've found for non-sticking yes i would say i'm a rice krispie treat expert but if you are using a different spatula um you can also butter the spatula rub some butter along it and that will help with the not sticking as well and there are our rice krispies treats a little trick you can use that you do today is to use marshmallow to make spider webs if you melt some marshmallow then you can string it out and make marshmallow spider webs on something so if i was on my game today i would have done that melted some marshmallow with some black food coloring and you can make this a spooky halloween treat it's also great to um use cookie cutters and make shapes so i can tell you from the pieces i'm tasting that it is tasty and i'm getting just a hint of the peppermint and it's just really refreshing and um all the goodness of the rice krispie treats with just a little extra like mmm what was that that's not a normal rice krispie treat so hope you guys enjoy let me know what are your favorite marshmallow treat recipes and be sure to tune back in next friday at 5 p.m for another edition of foodie friday with the cocoa queen that's me have a great weekend", "hmdrLHs0i_c": "hey guys today we're making white chocolate marshmallow bars and if you know me and you've been following what's got be cooking for a while you know I have the dessert palate of like a ten-year-old and I'm not ashamed of it bars cookies brownies all day long these are one of my favorite recipes to make it's just really simple to whip up so here we go look at my new pots and pans they're very shiny from my favorite place on earth William Sonoma we just have a little bit of vegetable oil in here so we're gonna put this over high heat and we're gonna pour some kernels right into the cot put the lid on and then we're gonna give it a little bit of a shake and then it's just gonna kind of do its thing we'll continue to shake it so it's evenly popped and perfect which I have to tell you it's one of my favorite thing about these pots there are no hot spots so making all right that is just gonna do its thing and we'll start hearing it meanwhile I'm gonna melt a little bit of white chocolate okay so here's the thing about melting chocolate it needs to be melted in intervals so I just melt white chocolate at 30-second intervals take it out of the microwave give it a little stir so it's gonna evenly melt down and this probably just needs I don't know 30 seconds more all right this is perfect look it's a perfectly smooth and we're from let this sit here for a couple of seconds until our popcorns done popping popcorn is literally one of my favorite sounds in the kitchen like some people like to fall asleep when it's raining I think I would like to fall asleep too popcorn popping it's just like very soothing okay moment of truth oh I'm alright so our white chocolate is just gonna get drizzled right on top of the popcorn and we're just gonna toss it up while it's still in the pot give it all a mix to combine all right all the chocolate is combined so let's go over here I have to tell you guys by the way like finding a non-stick pan has been the bane of my existence for the past couple years this is the only one I love it's so incredible alright so turn that on we're gonna throw a couple tablespoons of butter right into the pan just melt it down [Music] all right that's mostly melted and we're just gonna dump 16 ounces of marshmallows into this pan and while the butter finishes finishes melting these are gonna melt down and we want it to be super smooth just give them a stir you're gonna have it's not like as complicated as risotto but you want to keep your eyes on this so nothing burns and it all evenly melts [Music] alright so while those marshmallows are just finishing up I'm gonna pour a ton of sprinkles on top of the popcorn now that the white chocolate is cooled a little bit you can see the marshmallows are perfectly smooth I turn the heat all the way off and we're just gonna take this and pour these into the marshmallow mixture everything gets stirred until it's evenly coated with all the marshmallows all right and then I just have like an 8 by 8 or a 9 by 9 a little baking pan and we are going to just pour this whole mixture into here I sprayed it already with nonstick spray which is muy importante because marshmallow stick look at that it just glides right out I may or may not like that clean later let me just flatten all this out and kind of press it down as you're flattening it out so you have a really nice dense marshmallow bar when we cut these open and then the last thing we're just gonna sprinkle a couple sprinkles on top because more is more all right these have chilled for a couple seconds you want to chill them too much because of having that nice warm marshmallows so good I'm just gonna sprinkle them with a little bit of Maldon sea salt on top or any flaky sea salt you can get your hands on to give it an extra punch of flavor and that's it I'm gonna cut these up the full recipe is on watch Bobby cooking calm and I can guarantee you you're gonna be obsessed you", "v32J-JhwZdA": "I need 10,000 quest bars

let's do this thing you make the recipe I'll film the episode on my camera welcome to the Penske kitchen I mean good book dudes kitchen today we're gonna be making peanut butter protein rice krispie treats employees at a treat for this recipe we're going to be needing Rice Krispies vanilla protein agave woof peanut butter dark chocolate starting this recipe off we're going to be going with the three cups of the crispy cereal we're going to be putting them right into a larger bowl and letting them sit hold them right there immediately gonna take half a cup of agave and half a cup of peanut butter and we're going to be putting them into a medium-sized bowl microwave-safe so go ahead and pour the agave right in to the microwave safe medium sized bowl I'm sure it get all out of there and they're going to take half a cup of Superchunk peanut butter candy scraping that into the bowl here that's done we're just gonna kind of mix this in together here a little bit now that we got the peanut butter and agave and mixed up we're going to be putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds so I'll heat it up make sure it makes it in good nice warm hot all smooth now we're going to take the two scoops of vanilla protein powder mix it in a little bit I got one scoop in there gonna get the second one delicious protein in it now that we got the agave in the peanut butter and the protein all mixed in here as you can see a nice thick consistency we're gonna clean it in with the crispy cereal here so go ahead and scrape all out of this bowl right into the serial number in RAM now you're going to taking a spatula here or something similar just we mix in that cereal in with the agave peanut butter and protein mix here making sure it's nice and sticky it makes really well now you might notice the peanut butter agave in the protein mixture is gonna be pretty thick and it's gonna be hard to mix so what you want to do is just take your hands if you get patience like I do and just mix it up nice and well and once that's all done we taking a cooking sheet here get some cooking spray get a nice light spray there make sure your rice krispies treats aren't sticking to the pan after pulled out of fridge so once that's done you're just going to dump it into the pan or get it kind of lay it nice and flat squish it down make sure it's all together and bind it together here I think we got it now we're ready for the dark chocolate topping which is optional of course so we're going to be making a little bit of a half-and-half tree here after our chocolate on the top and half without so what you want to do is just take six little chunks of dark chocolate put it in a microwave-safe Bowl we're going to head over the microwave and cook it up to make sure it liquefies Oh perfect completely melted through nice and liquidy sometimes these bowls get a little hopping in the microwave so you want to be careful now but we're good to go especially because we're buff dudes all right so rich and take this chocolate we're gonna slowly pour it over the rice krispies treats right on top yeah we made this recipe half with chocolate on top half without and we use a little bit smaller of a pan so if you increase the pan size you're just going to want to add a little bit more chocolate we use six bars of chocolate so you could use eight to ten if you want to cover the whole thing you just increase it a little bit more so that way you cover the whole recipe with chocolate that being said we're gonna put this in the refrigerator for 30 minutes all right now that the 30 minutes are up we're pulling the rest Kristy treats out of the refrigerator and we're ready to cut it up all right we're done with the buff dudes protein peanut butter rice today you're not plumbers you're those pesky buff dudes oh no Brahmas yeah yeah Mike it's give me some of that hey sink sludge is pretty good thanks guys I guess you could say the food's approved", "WnVGAVZd1fc": "hey everyone welcome back to our kitchen my name is Emily and this is Lauren and we're two of Festival's mealtime mentors so we recognize that more and more people are becoming diagnosed with either food allergies and intolerances and we're really here to help tailor our resources and recipes to meet your needs yes so today we're excited to share an allergen friendly sweet treat that is really great for anybody um so today we're making peanut butter crispy treats and we're super excited about this recipe for lots of different reasons yeah so this recipe is not only yummy super delicious but it's also only three ingredients you know doesn't love that let's just jump right in we'll start talking about some where different greens that were using so the first ingredient of those three is Sun butter or sunflower seed butter you can find it in our natural and organic compartment and we really like this because it's free from the top eight allergens so if you don't need to eat allergen friendly you could also use peanut butter or some other nut butter but this is a really great option for a lot of different people so I'm just going to go ahead I have a pan or a pot here and I'm just going to melt our Sun butter and some butter it sounds a little different but it's actually really delicious and it has a very similar texture it has a lot of the same nutritional properties as well as a lot of the other nut butters I would just come from sunflower seeds so it's really just using a seed instead of a nut which makes it not free and peanut free and this is really thank you it really melts down pretty quickly and we're using the natural variety today which simply means that there's no added ingredients so if you were using maybe an almond butter a peanut butter we recommend using a natural variety that has less ingredients it's just going to melt actually a little bit better and we're adding an other ingredients that are going to help sweeten it up a little bit so it really doesn't need any more sweetness right and that's a great point because some of those natural nut butters or Sun butter will have some separation in the container and that's completely normal it just means that there aren't any stabilizers or other ingredients that keep it together so all you need to do is stir it up and stick it in the refrigerator upside down and you'll it'll be one solid piece just like a typical peanut butter or a nut butter some butter and so that works for your natural peanut butter is your Sun butter really anything it's an awesome trick coursing charm so the next ingredient are some puffed rice cereal and this is typical to your rice cereal but this is special because it's brown rice so it's a whole grain which we love and it's also gluten free so you can find this in our natural department and the usually comes in bags and what you want to do is make sure that if you do in fact need to eat gluten-free maybe for celiac disease that you look for the gluten-free yep the certified lizard by clean debris either verbage or a logo on there so all we need to do is just stir this up until it's nice and coated really doesn't take any time at all and this is great because this is literally our base two ingredients really simple and actually really holds them as well well emily is doing that I'm just going to start to coat our non-stick pan well it's not nonstick that's why I'm spraying it but we're using a it's a glass dish you could use an 8 by 8 pan you can use a 9 by 9 we're using a 9 by 13 really the only difference is how how deep your bars are going to be it really doesn't matter we've used a couple different ones and they work every time alright so I am just going to put these mitts on side I'll let you tell them where you're going to this dump this in here all smells so good it does gosh so just need to get it all in our pan and then we can kind of spread it out from there I got a little bit more at the top this is definitely a two-person job so get the kids involved yes definitely fun but is just a lot faster than having to microwave yeah oh definitely that should be good so from here all I'm doing is just kind of pushing it in there evening about because we have chocolate to put over the top you want to progress so today we are using enjoy life another really great allergen friendly brand it's also free from the top eight allergens and all we did was stuff in the microwave for first 30 against to get it started to melt and then we did it in 15 second increments until it was completely melted perfect so you I can pour this over the top now these remind me of like scotch aru's or really easy bars to make they're really great for a lot of those warm weather gatherings that are going to be coming up soon they're also great for school treats yes if you're allowed to make those a lot of schools are becoming not free or peanut free but these might work within your specific needs um with that I do want to make the little disclaimer that you know even though we're calling these allergen friendly we we recognize that this may not work for everyone so we always encourage you to check the ingredients and make sure that the ingredients are the products that we're recommending fit within your specific needs yeah because everybody is very different so this looks pretty good so from here what we would do is just put this in the refrigerator for about two hours so I'm just going to bring this back have some that are already done and light enough you can see here we actually use an 8x8 inch pan for this one so just to kind of give you a little bit of different these are a lot thicker but they still taste just delicious of course should give it a try and I just kind of like emember feels that you can't just like fit it right in your mouth mm-hmm I love the fun butter in here they're definitely a little bit more dense too because of the puffed rice mm-hmm but also a little bit better for you as well well whether you need to eat allergen semele or not we hope you give this yummy three ingredient treat a try and for more recipes and resources from your mealtime mentors visit best foods calm",

similar to rice krispies treats you can use any cereal that you'd like and I have these marshmallows debts semi switch it on the car ride home with butter and I will show you the fourth ingredients once we get to that step so moving along to step 1 what I'm going to do is just place some of the cereal whatever it is for your choice into a separate bag I bought this part so I've made these to taste and I'm just going to there goes my sweaty marshmallows that's exactly why I made these because I had these sweaty marshmallows but they were still good so I'm just gonna crush this cereal not too small but small enough to be edible I don't know about you guys but I did not want my cereal bars cereal marshmallow treat to be you know super duper clumpy now what we're going to do is place these stove on medium low so on 4 but don't go up to 5 and I'm just going to add three tablespoons of butter if you want to measure based off the stick of butter there are lines on the side of it if you just want to be super precise but I was also eyeballing this part and now we're just going to let them butter melt down all the way now step 3 add the marshmallows in and if your marshmallows were sticky icky like mine then just use some water on your hands - yeah take them out and they will stick to your hands now I'm just mixing it up make sure that you stay by your part at this time so that the marshmallows do not stick to the bottom because then that will be super tragic but with all this butter I seriously doubt that they would stick so step four this is where you add the cereal and your fourth ingredient which can be vanilla chocolate chips peanut or you could also use sprinkles and for this fifth step you're going to want to make sure that your pan is buttered at the bottom will on the bottom and I did not make enough treat to fill up the pan but that's okay I didn't want them to be too thick and you're just gonna let this sit and cool this one is cooled for one hour since they are thinner but if you want yours to be thicker then I would advise letting it sit and cool at room temperature for two hours mmm do you see that gooey gooey and they were good thank you guys for watching", "yBnbzpmPkiE": "today kevin and i are going to be trying the new rice crispy treats these are home style i have the original i have chocolate these were 250 each at meijer uh that is for six bars so if you want to know what makes these home style it says we've folded extra marshmallows into our thickest gooiest home home style treats with home style flavor they're made 50 bigger with pockets of melted marshmallow throughout so they know that when you make them at home you probably use more than what they use normally although the size of that does not look is that really 50 bigger it did it just well typically thicker it is more calories so the the there's a difference in calorie between the two the the original is 130 calories i think a traditional rice krispie treat is only 90 calories so uh that's uh so this is more definitely has more marshmallows and it is thicker oh yeah a lot of marshmallow i never really liked marshmallow i'd rather make it myself because i always flip the other ones they never had enough marshmallow in them so they're more stickier [Applause] it's very sweet i and prefer the traditional rice crispy tray i like the ones you get for 90 calories you because that one is um because it does have so much marshmallow it's really really sticky on your fingers but it's also a lot chewier chewier yes it's it's very chewy and you know they're putting in the extra marshmallow but so they took out having so much cereal in there and that cereal as much as we probably thought we would have liked to have more marshmallow it's really better just the traditional one yeah i don't know i mean homemade ones are the best that's what i'm saying i'd rather have a homemade one even more once [Music] and i know they do not sell these as rice krispie treats as a low calorie snack however i have bought especially when you can go like during halloween and probably for valentine's day and all the holidays probably they sell them in little miniatures and for i think they were only 40 calories [Music] it's just a little square and so i have been known to buy a box of those to keep for myself not to give away you know because they're just low calorie just you know just something uh a sweet jolt and and i've been known to buy the 90 calorie one too so yeah so these are 10 additional calories for the chocolate and you can see the white marshmallow yes how chewy they are i just i don't like that texture these are even denser than the regular ones it says it's 33 grams the regular bar is 22 grams um that is a uh like a it's chocolate but i mean it's more like a a coco yeah it's not like it's a milk chocolate or something like that it doesn't come across that way um very dense and chewy though it's very very chewy yeah um i think for kids the original or easy to eat i i really do uh these i think are you know you saw me how i had to put it you had a tug on it like a dog treat you know a dog toy um i just for these are not for me um as much as i i wanted to really like them and like i said the idea of more marshmallow you know that's very appealing because like in cereal that's you want more marshmallow right and it's terrific in this it just doesn't um it doesn't work unless you really really want something chewy yeah because they they put the whatever marshmallow they're using is a really chewy dense dry marshmallow not like a marshmallow cream which most people use a lot of people use marshmallows marshmallows what we use yeah or you can use regular marshmallows but they're still softer than those yeah they're not chewy like these and these are these are really just chewy but if you had to choose between the two the vanilla the original the original that's the ones i would choose too because the cocoa ones are okay with their they're and they're still super sweet i just don't like that cocoa flavor that's what i was gonna say the original are sweeter they seem sweeter than the chocolate yeah but yeah so i'll have a picture for you at the end if you've tried these let us know what you thought and thanks for watching [Music] you", "xdJN8pmroU8": "hello I am Seth walk today I quote so you have to be super awesome we also need marshmallows butter and vanilla and five cups of cereal now putting order cup of butter and a pot on the stove and see this army of you do it's

and please subscribe", "m3dRU46IfpU": "hi guys it's Joanne from fifteen spatulas today we are going to make some chocolate chip granola bars this is a recipe for my friend Katherine's new cookbook called delicious lunches and what I love about Katherine's book is it's full of ideas to make your lunchbox more exciting and this recipe in particular caught my eye because I ate granola bars all the time and I was a kid and this recipe is a better tasting and cheaper version of the store-bought granola bars so I'm just going to finish up adding 4 cups of old-fashioned rolled oats to a bowl here to this I'm also going to add a quarter cup of whole wheat flour 1/2 cup of toasted shredded unsweetened coconut 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and half a teaspoon of kosher salt and we're just going to toss this all around with a spatula to combine to get our wet ingredients going and measuring out 1/2 cup of grapeseed oil you can do any kind of neutral oil here like canola oil or vegetable oil and to that same measuring cup I'm going to add 1/2 cup of honey we're also going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract just for a little extra flavor and pour this into my bowl and whisk it to combine okay so we're just going to pour this all over our dry ingredients this is going to bind our bars together we're just going to stir this around until it's combined once your ingredients are combined you're just going to dump the mixture out onto a Silpat or parchment lined baking sheet and you want this to be about an inch thick so I like to take a flat spatula like this and kind of press it down into a compacted rectangle and you can use the flat edge to square off the edges this is going to go into 325 degree oven for about 40 minutes once the bars have finished baking you want to let them cool completely and then you can take a really sharp knife and cut them into individual bars I'm actually going to go in for a taste hmm these are so much better than the store bought version and it's all-natural so you can pick up a copy of Katherine's book wherever books are sold I put Amazon link in the description box below thanks so much for watching I'll see you guys next Thursday [Music]", "m18jrJyOhRI": "[Music]", "5wvqkWZ0XrI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "0AxQ7yaLfHw": "I will be doing a double recipe but I'm going to give you the single recipe so first you want to start off with 1 10.5 ounce package of mini marshmallows 6 cups of rice cereal 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter 1/2 teaspoon of salt I'm using sea salt and a couple of tablespoons of colorful sprinkles so what I'm going to do is in a large pot on a low heat I am going to melt down a stick of butter again I am doubling the recipe for all of the ingredients and measurements please look to the description box below this video again I just want to mention that you need to work with a low heat because eventually once the butter melts I'm going to add my mini marshmallows if the pan is too hot your marshmallows will scorch and burn and you don't want that ok so my butter is now melted down I'm going to add my salt and if you are using salted butter just keep the salt out you don't want to add any extra salt but I like to use unsalted butter to control the amount of salt I like in my recipes now I'm just going to add my mini marshmallows and ultimately I am just going to slowly allow them to melt down and mix with the butter and the salt because I'm working with a stainless steel pot I am going to constantly stir and coat my mini marshmallows in the melted butter below you want to constantly start now if you're using a nonstick pot or pan you might get away with just letting the marshmallows sit there and not stirring constantly but since this is a stainless steel pan I don't want to walk away and just let it melt because then I run the risk of burning my marshmallows now that my marshmallows are melted down with the butter and the salt I am going to turn off the heat and at this point I am just going to add my rice cereal my colorful sprinkles and then I am just going to combine all of the ingredients together and mix well okay so now that everything is combined at this point you can take a 9 by 13 baking dish make sure you lightly oil it and just compact all of your rice marshmallow mixture into it and allow it to set and cool but I am going to be making a birthday cake for my son today and because he has allergies to egg I thought this was the perfect way to create a birthday cake that was egg free and he loves rice krispie treats so what I have here is just a small Corningware dish that's round I did not even measure it but I'm going to be making a two-tier birthday cake I guess I should say a mock birthday cake with rice krispies treats so I have oiled the inside of this dish I have added extra sprinkles to the bottom and now I am just going to fill it with all of the rice krispies mixture I am going to repeat this exact same process with an 8 by 3 inch cake pan round cake pan and I'm going to allow them to set and then I'll show you how I put them together [Music] okay so now that I have pressed down and compacted all of the Rice Krispies mixture into my cake pan I am going to allow it to set for at least two hours in the fridge okay so now what I'm going to do is just turn out both of my cake pan and other round container onto my cake platter and just set them up and they're going to look exactly like a cake I'd also like to mention that I did double the recipe and I did end up with extra rice cereal mixture so I went ahead and put that just in a small square baking dish and I cut those into squares so again the single recipe fits perfectly in a nine by thirteen inch baking dish and you can most definitely just cut them into squares after allowing it to set but today I wanted to do something a little special for my little guy I'm going to flip this out onto the bottom layer I'm going to add a candle a little bit of decoration and it's ready to celebrate my little ones birthday so it's a birthday tradition in our house for the boys we like to set up the table at night when they are asleep and then in the morning when they come downstairs they have their nice little birthday surprise so this is how we set it up it's very simple but we love it and they love it too [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] I hope you give this recipe a try I hope you like it and thanks for watching hey guys you can click on the video icons

it's 5:40 and even if you know the Monday and I haven't made a video yet this week professional but I decided that I wanted to cook something for today's video and I wanted to make a snack and I want to do something easy because it's already 5:40 and I haven't even started editing or filming or anything so we have these tricks cereal here and I went on Pinterest and I found the recipe for tricks cereal bars they're kind of like rice krispies but with drinks and so I thought I'd go ahead and try that and sort of follow the directions so the directions first of all have you move using ten cups of Trix cereal but the box only has nine in it so I decided to do a half recipe so I'll put the link to the recipe in the description but I cut everything in half also the recipe says to do it in the microwave but I don't like to melt marshmallows in the microwave because I end up burning my hands on the bowl and all that stuff so I figured let me do it and even harder way and make it in a giant pot on the stove so here we go let's do this first you're supposed to melt the butter and the marshmallows together so I've got two tablespoons of butter and one bag of mini marshmallows I'm going to turn the stove to a setting above low and I'm going to put the butter in and let that melt a minute I just realized I was supposed to grease my pan with butter first hold on come back okay the actual step one greasing the pan with the butter okay it's getting all over my fingers okay that's greased enough actually I'll use this to raise my boom it's nice to use a greased there's food on the spoon I won't be using a spoon well our only other option has holes in it so hopefully that works okay LuAnn has been greased I'm going to go ahead and have oh those good to grease your spoon handle too I'm gonna stir this until it's all melted okay little boy I might come back when it's okay it's starting to look very melty and I'm feeling very short and it's very sticky I don't remember it ever get quite so sticky when I've done it before well the marshmallows are all just staying in a blob and they're not melting okay now we're getting somewhere it's looking much more melty okay it's mostly melted now so we're going to go ahead and add in the Trix cereal I'm doing five cups of cereal but I'm going to do it like one cup at a time and so that I can mix it all in there's one how much when they eat object [Music] this seems like a lot of marshmallows for this amount of treats a little more cereal what in the world why isn't so stringy I'm gonna add some more cereal cuz it seems like too much marshmallow then the recipe doesn't say to add this but we have some white chocolate chips and I thought that might taste good in with this I'm going to put some messages it please don't ruin my recipe now I'm going to take all of this and put it in this baking pan thing how we're going to do this working maybe make this without someones help this is not as easy if anything oh the GoPro sticky now that's most of it and then you're supposed to smush it down into the pan with a greasy spoon I don't have a greased to spoon my greasy spoon is covered in stuff so I'm going to use my very non greased hands they're clean hands though then it says to go ahead and cut it but I feel like it should cool for like a minute before I cut it so I'm gonna let it cool I'm gonna get this off my hands okay we're back I have obtained about a knife it's been like 10 minutes maybe I definitely did not just eat a bunch of the white chocolate marshmallow stuff out of the bottom of the pan and discover that it is delicious that didn't just happen but now we're here and I'm going to go ahead and dig into the bars because I want to finish the video so here they argue what they will look like they look great they smell fantastic so I'm going to cut into them oh they're still sticky that's what probably should have waited a little bit longer here is a sticky sticky corner we're gonna go in try these not then it definitely just tastes like I put white chocolate chips and marshmallows in trick cereal that is a delicious flavor combination and I like them I definitely recommend making these maybe they make them with some help if you're short and not terribly strong like I am but they're delicious and yeah I recommend anyway thank you for watching and I will see you next week

them in your lengths we do this in 30 second intervals stirring between each one so that it doesn't overheat and burn your chocolate after you're done melting your chocolate you're going to watch to know your caramel now you don't have to know your criminal if you want to skip that step and make a little easier you can just take their caramel as they are and cut them in half so they're a little bit thinner so cut them in half horizontally so you get like a thinner piece so that they stay this nice square shape but are a little thinner and fit really nicely it right on top of your rights could be treat bite if you want a little premiere thermal barrier your bite you're going to take your caramel you're gonna unwrap 25 with them pour in two tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and

things y'all to do with my boys homemade granola bars oh my gosh you can teach so many different lessons just by making granola bars so today on divas can cook that's what we're making let's go okay to start we gonna add our cream a creamy peanut butter into a large bowl and next we're gonna add in our honey I like using the raw honey that's kind of like in solid form it really helps to hold these granola bars together next we're gonna add in some brown sugar because yeah I like it then we're gonna add in some vanilla extract this is such an easy peasy recipe no baking cooking required which I think okay these boys I don't know why they're stirring it like that I told them to stir it up and actually we are missing an ingredient which is why it's so hard to stir I was like some man right what's going on but Oh we'll get to that in a minute here are our dry ingredients some oats some crisp it some coconut and some chocolate chips I'm gonna just dump all of this into a large bowl and you can add in like nuts and stuff you don't have to add in what word you know you can switch up the measurements if you like coconut just add more Krispies and you know what is now we're gonna mix this out up and you can also end in some chia seeds hemp seeds all that kind of good stuff now we're gonna mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and that was like that was like hot on something is just not right why are we having such a hard time you know stirring these granolas up you know it's not usually like this and then I'm like oh Lord we don't forgot the butter we forgot the butter so we ended up throwing the butter in last but you really relay should have put that butter in with the peanut butter so yeah don't forget that okay because a man it took us a long time to really stir that butter in but we worked it out okay we worked it out so go ahead and just stir this all together into you until it's nice and thick and really holding its shape and when you can form a little ball a nice tight ball it's ready to go so we're gonna dump this into for parrot pan I kind of lined it with some parchment make sure you line up my parchment or it won't come out it'll be very very hard to come out so I dumped that right on in and now here's the most important part we're gonna press as hard as you can kids press press press and you know it's so funny anytime post a video with my boys people are always like oh my gosh your kids work so well together they're so you know this and that and I'm like okay but let me just turn this volume up on this clip so you guys can give what really goes on okay all right switch off let's take turns with it sooo yeah I got normal kids all right normal kids they argued with every single step okay we're gonna refrigerate for 30 minutes just until it gets all nice and firm and stuff and then once it comes out of the fridge go ahead look how it just pops right out it's why I love this parchment paper love it love it love it okay so now we're gonna cut it into bars and they're really these are really sweet okay they're sweet so normally I don't do these bars I do little fun size bite-sized granola bars but you know for the video I'm gonna do that regular sized bars and stuff I have my little almond bark right here I just melted it and now we're just gonna just dip it into the chocolate just like that just like that kind of help it out a little bit spread it on and then we'll just pull it back out in wallah it is okay pull it back out girl there it is see very very easy and you can add in like some mint extract if you want to you can use candy melts and have like colorful granola bars just you know have fun with it you can sprinkle cookies on top you can put cookies inside of it you can just it's so versatile like really you can do what you want to do and um usually the boys like to add things like you know sprinkles or nuts or cookies and things on top but yeah just go ahead and place it on the parchment paper and it really sets up really really quickly so yeah that's it you guys dip lenola bars so easy make your kids no baking require just something fun to do you know I hope you guys

making cereal bar treats using today we're going to do a fun video for st. Patrick's Day today we're going to be making cereal bar treats using Lucky Charms and I thought it would just be the perfect opportunity to use one of my favorite cereals in a cereal bar because almost st. Patrick's Day today we're going to do a very simple recipe you've got three ingredients plus some if you wish and that's about it so we're gonna get started I'm still here I have a I call it a stuck pot or saucepan you're gonna put a saucepan on the stove you want one to be deep enough to put all your ingredients in but it doesn't have to be massive you're gonna put it on the burner and turn it on to medium about medium heat next you're gonna take I have three tablespoons of shortening you can also use real butter you can use margarine or anything a butter substitute three tablespoons of shortening we're gonna let that melt and then once it starts fully melting then we will add in our marshmallows okay now that our shortening has melted I'm gonna go ahead and add in two and a half cups of marshmallows I just use playing jet puff marshmallows I like to sit to name brand because I feel like jet puff tastes much better than store-bought so I'm gonna go ahead and stir that in and allow it to melt completely before I add in the cereal okay now that the marshmallows have melted I'm going to go ahead and turn off the heat and I'm gonna add in five cups of cereal so what's great about this recipe is that you can add any kind of cereal or things I say in honor of lucky himself I'm going to be adding I'm gonna just make this up with a silicon spatula until it's well combined now that everything's that all mixed up I'm going I've prepped a nine by nine glass dish and sprayed it with cooking spray and I'm gonna go ahead and pour in just enough I'm gonna see how deep this gets I don't have a nine by thirteen but I think that would make a pretty thin stereo bar this one's probably gonna make it pretty thick cereal bar like height-wise actually yeah and what you want to do is you want to press it in don't press too hard you don't want this to be super compact otherwise people can't eat it but I'm gonna take the back of my spatula and it's pretty oily from the shortening and I'm going to just press into all right well these are setting up and what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna melt some white chocolate what I have here is a small saucepan full of water and a glass bowl full of white chocolate chips and you want to fill up the stockpot to have enough water to boil well but you don't want the water touching the bowl so I'm gonna put this on medium-high and will not allow this to start boiling and melting the chocolate okay what I have here is a bowl of melted white chocolate and it has been boiling for just a little bit as you can see the steam coming off of it I've gone ahead and turn off the burner because I don't want this to burn burnt my chocolate is the worst so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this spoon and I'm gonna drizzle this white chocolate over the top of my cereal bars and this could get messy another option is to cut the bars and then dip them in chocolate but I feel like that might be just too much for me so I'm just drizzling the melted chocolate in a crisscross pattern now that I have all the white chocolate drizzle on top I'm actually going to take a mixture of sprinkles most of these are gold sprinkles that you can buy at Michels and probably Hobby Lobby found these sprinkles in the like single serving packs at Michael's I think they're like a dollar for a packet of sprinkles and I thought the gold sequins and star sequins would fit perfectly because of st. Patrick's Day so I'm going to sprinkle these on top you can sprinkle any kind of sprinkle you would like I have used st. Patrick's Day with ones before that have little clovers in them but I thought this would be really cute alright now that we have all of the sprinkles on top that I'd like I'm going to leave these set for a little bit so the chocolate dries will be lagging a little bit I'll cut them up into bars and present them to you okay guys my stereo bars have set and the white chocolate has set so I'm gonna just cut these up into pretty small slices and I'm using a relatively short knife and just [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "YI85KFFUuHg": "hey everyone welcome back to sick sister stuff today I am making chewy checks bars so my name is Kristen and this is she is my special helper in the kitchen today now we've teamed up with Czechs to bring you these chewy Czechs bars these are so easy to make you don't even need a pan to put them together all you need is the microwave and about five ingredients all right yeah let's head on to the kitchen and make these delicious chewy Czechs bars so the five ingredients you need are rice Chex cereal marshmallows butter chocolate chips and candy coated chocolate now we're gonna start with the four tablespoons of butter we're gonna put it in a microwave safe Bowl and microwave it until it is about halfway melted now once it's a little bit melted we're going to add in our marshmallows this is about 4 cups of mini marshmallows you could also use the big marshmallows too I would add about 4 and 1/2 or 5 cups of those so now you're just going to stir and mix the butter in with the marshmallows and microwave it again now you're gonna microwave just until the marshmallows are melted then you're gonna add about 6 cups of Chex cereal now just mix it until it's well combined now after I'm done mixing it pretty well I let it cool for just a minute or two before adding my candy because if it's really hot it will melt my candy and I don't want to melt all of the candy I want it to still stay in its shape so very gently mixing your candy so if you don't crush your candy and so you don't crush the chick cereal now once you're done mixing you're gonna pour it into a 9 by 13 pan and now we sprayed this pan with nonstick cooking spray so it'll be easy to pull off the cereal bars when they're done cooling okay spread it out and here is my trick I like to spray Pam or a nonstick cooking spray onto her hands so she'll be able to press it down without it sticking so I just sprinkled on a few more candy and then press them down so it can add a little more color now for the topping we're gonna melt the chocolate chips in the microwave if it's not melted enough you could add a little bit of oil and melt it more in the microwave but you want it pretty I like mine thick instead of really thin so a little bit thick so you can actually taste the chocolate as you drizzle it on now once the chocolate is hardened go ahead and cut it up and let your kids taste it now I just have to say I think my kids really enjoyed this recipe now a special thanks to Chex cereal and General Mills for sponsoring this post all right you guys that's all I have for you today I hope you have a wonderful weekend

"how to make your own little forest of rice krispy Christmas trees [Music] hello everyone starting off with a large bowl and ten ounces of marshmallows and three tablespoons of butter put this in the microwave on HIGH and cook it for about a minute to two minutes depending on the strength in your microwave until the marshmallows are puffed up and melted and then stir the butter and the marshmallows together this is a super easy way of making these but if you don't want to use the microwave you can put the ingredients in a pot on the stove on low and melt it that way once you've stirred the marshmallows and the butter together add some green food coloring and continue to stir it to get a nice green color then add your cereal 6 cups of rice krispies cereal or rice bubbles if you live in Australia you can also use special case cereal for this as well so once you start it up in a cereal as well coated you're gonna remove small portions I'm using a 1/3 cup measuring cup for this that I've greased a little bit of butter and I've also put butter on my hands just to make sure that cereal doesn't stick to them to make it easier to handle then I take the little portion I kind of compact it together a bit and then form it into a Christmas tree shape I put a little bit of ax paper down in the counter just so that it wouldn't stick and then I put the little tree down flat so you get a nice flat base to it and I formed it into the shape of a Christmas tree now I had these little these little candies I put them on the wax paper and I just rolled the Christmas tree in right in them but you can also take individual little candies and stick them on in if you'd like as well now for the top of the tree if you have star candies a little yellow star candies you can add those to the top of the tree I just put a little yellow M&M now for the trunk of the tree I'm using these Reese Reese's Peanut Butter Cup miniatures I left the paper on because I liked the way it looked like a trunk of a tree just tell people that there's paper on it before you serve them and just stick it to the bottom of the tree and then I put them on a plate and put them in the refrigerator just to hasten the cooling process a bit to solidify them a bit and they are done they are so cute if you put them in little individual treat bags you can give them out as little presents thanks for

anything else how little yeah you can eat it super sweet its Golden Grahams cereal chocolate chips mini marshmallows and go around zero so now they're saying you can make many s'mores a shoe bar yeah let me get right to this there's a trick to it you know cover up much the other screen happened let's hit chocolate on the bottom we were trying to do they they've had golden gram bars before and these are called s'mores and we're didn't know if these were different or what we couldn't find the other one so we couldn't tell yeah very chewy super sweet though mm-hmm these are 130 calories per bar low well please no take you maintain you yeah yeah you work your duels done we'll be honest I think they're great yeah I think they're great no do you think it fits like it's more of them yes there they remote maybe things like a s'more but that golden gram flavor each is so good don't rub Cyril's any good um great marshmallow flavor great chocolate flavor the golden grain flavors they're the only downside is it's very very chewy but it's also a small bar that's our 30 calories so it's gonna take a minute to eat it I mean he's not bad oh she's a bad thing I think it's a good thing it makes you work out a little bit longer those are excellent that's of morality yeah these are in Android on my bar so this is of course it's not healthy bar this is just uh pure sugar bar by hunters

really enjoy them especially if you like that golden Ram flavor cereal that you don't have golden they don't have graham crackers over in England so they didn't know what they taste like even so for those across the pond there are its hardness properties gut rot so any what you do to be a unique experience it's definitely definitely unique so I hope you enjoyed this video and thanks for watching", "HYQEG7McBfM": "[Music]", "HHraQKyeP_U": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make peanut butter rice krispies treats and this is what they look like this is like the classic treat wonderfully sweet but it also has a flavor of peanut butter and it has a wonderful crispy texture so what I love about these treats as they're so easy to make they're no bake use everyday ingredients and they taste wonderful so you will need a 9-inch square pan which is 23 centimeters and the thing about when you make rice krispies treats is the batter is quite sticky so we have to make sure we either butter or you can use one of those nonstick sprays and we have to butter our pan so what I did is I just melted a little bit of butter and then I'm using the pastry brush okay said you could just use a nonstick spray and just spray everything and then the bowl that I'm going to mix everything together I'm also going to butter that okay I'm even I'm going to butter my spatula I'm going to use and then you will we have to melt our marshmallows so I'm also going to butter that because why not add a little more buttery flavor to our treats okay that looks good so the first thing we have to do is take four tablespoons that's 55 grams butter and we're going to melt that just over medium heat I'm going to start to melt that a little and then we're going to add a half a cup 125 grams of peanut butter your favorite brand is now I'm using the smooth and creamy because I that's what I prefer I mean if you want to add like a little bit of crunch of peanuts you could use the chunky your choice here it's starting to melt so I'm going to add my peanut butter and then I'm just adding a pinch of salt like an eighth of a teaspoon to that yeah we're just gonna melt that so that's almost melted so in our Bowl we are going to put six cups which I've already measured out which is a hundred and sixty grams I'm actually using Rice Krispies cereal but you could use any other type of a crispy rice cereal if you have another brand you like and just have that ready and then I'm going to add our marshmallows now you will need if you're buying your marshmallows you will need one 10 ounce bag which is about a hundred and eighty-five no 285 grams I'm using the mini marshmallows because they melt faster you could use the full size and if you're really ambitious you could go to the joy baking com website and you could make your own homemade marshmallows for this but I'm gonna be a little lazy here today and I'm just using the commercial brand always check the expiry date on your marshmallows when you buy them because you want them nice and fresh they melt a lot better if they're stale I'm also going to add a half a teaspoon two grams of pure vanilla extract just bump up that vanilla flavor you want to stir this a lot as those marshmallows melt down okay that looks good like that and then we're gonna just pour it over I find this mixture because we've added the peanut butter is not quite as sticky as the classic original rice krispies treat okay my pots a little dirty so what you do is run some hot water in there that will really loosen up that marshmallow the same with your bowl and just let the you know the hot water sit in your pot a little bit and it will just you know melt all that marshmallow mixture and then we're just gonna toss it all could you add things to this yes you could add you know you want peanut butter and chocolate go very well together you could add some chocolate chips you could add some chopped peanuts but you know what I just like the classic don't mess with it I don't like any added anything added to it you know if they say this is a kid's treat but I don't know adults like it - okay this one makes sure all that the cereal is coated and then we just I mean how long does that take under ten minutes okay right here that off again I'm just gonna put some hot water to clean my bowl and then I'm just using my hands I mean you can use back of the spoon press it out and the hardest part is we got to let these cool down and then they'll crisp up and they sleep so there we have it peanut butter rice krispies treats so I'm just gonna let those cool down and then when we come back we will try one so now we're ready to cut them now you can really any size that you want I'm just gonna take a little bit here still a little warm I like them that way to Baxter once one to that wonderful crispy texture I just love that and like the classic nice and sweet but I liked a little bit of the peanut butter flavor to them it's really good it's hard to stop at one so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski jory baking calm [Music] you [Music]", "UXsPuxM1xaA": "hi I'm

spread them out in I'm gonna put a stick of butter in my skinny yeah whole stick of butter I know so good it is so good okay I'm gonna pour a box and I got our open these and she decided you know I don't want Rice Krispies for breakfast oh nice crispy treats y'all we'll be right back with you I'm gonna grab a bigger boat alright does someone have to dig for this although that ain't much bigger is it whoa oh well hopefully okay so I'm gonna move my stick of butter into my pan stick so bad I'm using this pan one of these days I'll throw it away I'm gonna scoot down here beside my pretty cameras are awesome reach I don't want to turn it up too high I don't want to scorch my marshmallows because this pan sticks too bad now if you're doing a whole box of rice krispies crispy rice whatever kind of Syria that I would recommend two little bags of mini marshmallows or one giant bag you can use the bigger marshmallows I mean he's just melt a little faster okay these are melting to each other called Texas it's hot a gooey mess look at that I'll be alright I'm gonna be sticky I just got out of shower to make a nice fresh shower wash your hair playing goo oh my gosh they're so stuck to the package 105 and their laundry room with these four man hopefully your marshmallows will come out better than mine I mean we're gonna melt them anyway but still this makes it really difficult to get another package I don't want to burn some while I'm getting the others out but a mess like any dream mess but I love my daughter and she want it my sophisticates so eat a marshmallow for Commission we melt this down running Mississippi y'all see the sleepiness on me okay let me get this down here get everything ready so I'm gonna do is knock this down really melty not gooey melted but melted melted and stir why you don't sit down a stick all right y'all I'm gonna get back to you soon as I get this more melting okay I just turned my burner off if you have electric you can do that cuz it'll be hot for a minute if you have gas on the way to stick it it's about melted as you see you're gonna stir out the last of the club you can do this with other cereals let's tell my daughter I've seen people do it with food pebbles when she was little sometimes I would do this with them like Lucky Charms or so much just makes it more marshmallowy you can even do it Cheerios if you just want okay but it's best with rice krispies that's why it's called rice krispies treats and these are generic glass crispy so this is super cheap okay so you get your dunk on melting down and bloody now you want to take your bowl of cereal and you do not want to get this on you it is hot this gonna be hard Duke is really fool once you get it mixed in good you're gonna transfer it to a bigger pan where you can let it sit and you gotta stir really careful I needed a bigger bowl or less cereal I'm gonna just forgotten how much cereal I used to use these to make this one I have daycare license and so I'd make a lot of it at a time and then I try to cut my recipe down I might not cut it far enough on my cereal we'll see make it yourself all right so we're gonna try to get this mixed in and transfer it over you could do it in that bow but I didn't want to mess up the butter that I put in the bottom to keep it from sticking so slowly but surely mix it turn it all right I'm gonna get this mixed up and put it into the other pan hopefully not spill it hopefully and I'll get back with you in just a minute okay so couldn't figure out how come I've made this immediate on some toys just the right ratio of marshmallow to Rice Krispies and I couldn't figure out how the box was so cool but yet open in my daughter's brilliance we love her so much she's not as reported the old rice krispies in with the new your eyes Christmas ID bill to make more rice krispie treats she forgot to tell me since I didn't plan enough marshmallow so I put a little marshmallow fluff over the top hopefully they'll stay together or my kitchen looks like a disaster and I had just cleaned it and took a shower but I'll bet they taste good anyway now we're gonna hope they sit up cuz I really think you're gonna add some chocolate chips you really want to add them what's kind of hot some stay and that's it so we're no stood up we'll have chocolate chip rice krispies treats and the cabinet got

something edible kids come home from school you know and the first things out of their mouth isn't like Oh mom Oh dad I missed you you know school was so long it's usually I'm hungry what's for what's for snack what's for dinner you know that sort of thing so you know you got a kids come home you got to feed them and one of the best things that I know as far as snacks go is to give them these cereal bars that my son actually found in one of his magazines he comes to me with the recipe and says hey can we make this and turns out that it's a real hit here so what we're talking about is a snack mix like those old trail mixes that you used to have as a kid that had the peanuts and the raisins and the M&Ms in them you know all that good stuff that made your trail mix a trail mix and we're putting that into a cereal bar and you can serve these stimuli of ours at snack or breakfast or whatever they're really versatile so I'm going to show you how to make these Trail Mix snack bars today and we're going to begin by getting some stuff together for the microwave two tablespoons of butter into a microwave-safe container this two cup one is actually a pretty good size and then we're going to add 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter to that and you could use crunchy here too but we'll get to the peanuts proper here in a second you'll see why I used creamy so we've got our peanut butter and our butter and now we're going to put this in the nuclear about 30 seconds or so we're also going to add honey but we're not going to do that yet because because the honey kind of loses stuff as you microwave it so you know we're going to add it last so 30 seconds tops I mean I got it I got a heck of a microwave so you know know your microwave if it takes a minute it takes a minute if it takes 15 seconds it takes 15 seconds we just want to make sure that everything is melted enough so that we can whisk in honey and keep it smooth so that honey we just added to this slurry this is a quarter cup of honey you can use raw honey if you like or you know just plain old clover honey's good too I'm gonna whisk this and get it nice and smooth okay now that that's together I'm going to get before I even add this I'm going to get a pan together so that because this comes together really quick once you add the cereal I've got like an eighth inch or a nine inch square pan and I've got this sling of parchment here this is going to help you pull it in and out to cut into bars in order to keep that in place we're going to use a little bit of cooking spray and so just as it just an exit cooking spray on there and then we press this back in and it'll stay put now and I'm going to take my scissors and not because I just don't like to see the excess I got a use for this little piece of parchment right here we're going to save this so with our parchment sling in set this aside time to bring out the mixing bowl and now starting with 2 cups of crisp rice cereal rice krispies whatever you want to call them we're also going to add our hot sticky peanut buttery mess there we go normally I would add salt to something like this but there's salt in the peanut butter there's going to be salt in the peanuts that we add it just it doesn't need it so stir this together and once you get this start to get this coated then we're going to add all the stuff that makes this trail mix okay that's pretty good right there so I'm going to add now I'm going to add 1/3 of a cup of chopped cocktail peanuts my kids especially like these because they don't get peanuts at school I mean that's pretty common now and so you know they come home they're like craving peanut butter so you know this is a good way to good peanut butter delivery vehicle and then we're going to also add 1/3 cup of raisins to that don't like raisins use cranberries whatever this is just you know this is that traditional trail mix vibe going on here all right this is looking pretty good everything's nice and integrated and we are ready to put it into the pan notice I didn't add the M&Ms yet we'll get to that so into this into this pan try not to really beat these up I mean those are rice krispies and they will get scratched so I'm pressing this down in here and really you can't do your best pressing until you've used that reserved piece of parchment that we've got here you'll still get messy but you know it's better off than you would be and also not so much sticks to it so you'll be able to really press this stuff where it needs to go just even it out it doesn't have to be perfect trust me the kids aren't going to care they just going to want to eat these okay that's pretty good now see not much stuck to there that's good so now we've got I think two tablespoons and many M&Ms and maybe a few more kids like M&Ms with a so we'll just sprinkle those on top the nice thing about doing it this way is everybody sees the M&Ms nobody complains about you got more mms than I did so everybody sees them we can press these down in here if you want to it's pretty sticky though they might you might be okay so really that's it you don't really need to do anything else here except wait I'm going to put a lid on these and we're going to stick them in the freezer to set up about 10 15 minutes or so and I'm going to take these to the freezer for 15 minutes if there's any room here we go 15 all right it's been about 15 minutes and I think we're going to check in the freezer to see if our stuff is set so far so good okay now you're going to see the benefit of this sling right here if I did this right there we go so now you can use pizza cutter or big honkin knife like what I got and we can cut these into bars and you're going to want to keep these in the fridge when you're done I'm going to cut these I think you could cut these in halfsies I'm going to cut these into thirds because my kids got little mitts there we go and now we can just take this sling and they're back in there so anytime we want one we just go to the fridge and pull one out I'm going to take one out now so crunchy peanut buttery M&Ms raisins tastes just like trail mix they're really good and I know the kids are going to love these too so if you want to make these trail mix cereal snack bars for your kids you can log on to HD news net and get the recipe there or you can check out the details on my website

A fun fact about me that you might not know,\nI am an impulse eater, which means when I get hungry I will eat anything around me. So I have to have good food choices close\nby, just like my homemade granola bars. They are made with ingredients that that are\ngood quality and they're good for you. As always the recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nand make sure you check out my website for all of my other recipes. Okay, let's get started. So this recipe is an all in one kind of a\ndealio, we have a nice big saucepan, we're gonna mix it up in here, and then we're gonna\nput it into our baking tray. Very little fuss. So into my pot, I'm going to put in my butter. So all of you know I love to use Irish butter,\nbut you can also replace this with a healthy fat like coconut oil. Next ingredient is some honey for sweetness. These guys need to be sticky so that they\nkinda firm up. Adding another sugar in here with a little\nbit of a different flavor, maple syrup. Followed by a little bit of brown sugar which\ngives it kind of a caramel flavor. And then last but not least, some cinnamon. Not only does the little bit of cinnamon make\nthese taste really good, it's also actually really good for you too. Okay so then over a medium-low heat, let all\nof these ingredients melt together. So if you want to use just all honey or even\nall maple syrup in this recipe, feel free to do that, I just like how the two of them\ngive a little bit of a different flavor. Okay this is looking good, it's melty. Smells really good. This is like a tasty glue that holds your\noats together. One your butter is melted and your mix comes\nto a simmer, you can turn off the heat. So let's talk oats, these are rolled oats\nand they work best for your granola bars. You don't want to use steel-cut oats and you\ndon't want to use 1-minute quick oats. These are the best ones. Now, oats are fantastic because they are full\nof minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and what I love about them is especially if you have\nthem in the morning, they keep you fuller, longer. So they kind of slowly release their energy\nand they kind of fight that hunger so they're a really, really great way to start your day. So this is the fun part, this is where you\nget to add in whatever you like into your granola bars. Well, whatever you like within reason, to\nyour granola bars. Nuts, seeds, dried fruit, whatever you like. So here I have some dried coconut, I adore\ndried coconut, and the best thing about it is that it's full of healthy fats. So in you go. Next up I have some chopped almonds, add in\nwhatever nuts you like, pecans, cashews, what have you. These are full of antioxidants so they're\nreally good for you too. I don't know about you but I'm already feeling\neven healthier just looking at this. Next up I have some dried cranberries, I love\nthese little guys, I always have them to hand to put into salads and different recipes. These are full of vitamin C, put in raisins,\napricots, or leave them out and double up on the nuts. That's up to you. And then last but not least, a little bit\nof salt, because you know what I'm gonna say, all baking needs salt. It just enhances the flavors of everything\nelse. And then with your spatula just mix these\nall together until it's really well coated. Just keep on stirring until you've coated\nall of your ingredients really well. This is looking really good, now here I have\nin front of me a 12x9 tray. You can use a little bit smaller if you want\nyour granola bars to be that bit thicker, I like this size. I've lined it with some parchment, got my\nbig pot of granola, and then into my tray. Oh my gosh, that smells really good. So all you want to do is just spread them\nout with your spatula and press them into your tray. When you're making this, if you're thinking\nyou're not a huge cinnamon fan, honestly, the tiniest bit in there, it adds warmth and\nkind of a depth to these granola bars, it's really, really yummy. So now like I said, get creative, if you don't\nlike dried fruit add in more nuts, add in different seeds, just follow the quantities\nthat I give on the website, all a cup of each, because you don't want to add in too much\nstuff or your granola bars will be kind of dry. This is important because it just makes sure\nthat your granola bars are nice and compact. See honestly how long did that take us? Like less than 10 minutes, and our granola\nbars are all ready to go into the oven. Bake your granola bars off at 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C\nfor roughly 25-30 minutes or until they're a lovely golden brown on top. So while they're in the oven let me just tell\nyou if you want to make a no-bake style granola bar, that's totally fine, I've got lots of\ndifferent recipes on my website, all you have to do is mix them up and pop them into the\nfridge. So here's our granola bars, out of the oven,\nthey smell amazing, and they look perfect, I can tell that they're done because they're\na lovely golden brown on top, and they look like they're nice and sticky, so we're gonna\nset these aside and let them cool down for a few minutes. Once your granola bars have cooled down you\ncan remove them from the tray. So my granola bars are nice and firm because\nthey've cooled down, so now I'm just going to cut them around 1x4, now theirs is totally\nup to you, you can cut them any size you like. I just think that it's a good portion size. So I've got my bars cut up into 18 pieces\nand here I have a bowl of bittersweet melted chocolate. Now, we're not finished here, I've got some\nreally exciting news for you. Did you know that bittersweet chocolate is\nactually good for you? It is. It's good for you and it's delicious. It is full of antioxidants and it helps you\nto release endorphins which makes you happy, and who doesn't want that? So we're gonna dip our little granola bars\nin some chocolate. Then lay them on a tray and obviously leave\ntheir chocolate side facing up. I like to dip them in chocolate until it's\naround halfway up the bar. Lovely. So once you've dipped all your bars, you want\nthese guys to set nice and fast, so what you can do is pop them into the fridge or even\nthe freezer, for around 5-10 minutes or so and let the chocolate firm up. So I took my bars out of the fridge, as you\ncan see the chocolate is nice and set, so what you want to do is flip them over, and\nhave his naked side facing up. Now I've got a little bit of reserved chocolate\nhere and I'm just gonna drizzle it over the top. You don't have to be fancy here, this is pretty\nrustic. Just drizzle over and create nice little lines. This is just a little bit of an extra kick\nof chocolate, you don't have to do this if you don't want to. But if you ask me, the reason I like to do\nis because it makes them look really professional. Check that out. Beautiful. If you want to use a darker chocolate, that's\ntotally fine, if you want to use white chocolate, that's up to you. Gorgeous. So these granola bars will keep in an airtight\ncontainer at room temperature for up to 2 weeks and if you want to freeze them, pop\nthem into the freezer and then you can take them out whenever you want them. They are great to go in lunch boxes, to have\nat your desk, or even to snack on after a cooking show. Oh my gosh. It's one of my New Year's resolutions to eat\nfood that benefits me more. Not only are these made with good quality\ningredients, they're good for you too, and they make me very happy, so it's a win-win-win. Right now what I want you to do is head over\nto my website, I've got 500 more recipes and tons of videos that you might not have even\nseen before. I'll see you back here really soon, for more\nBigger Bolder Baking.", "hyYaEW5qUzM": "time for a kid's party classic that the whole family will love it's so simple to put together it's even so easy

puffed rice cereal whatever you call it in your neck of the woods we're just mixing those dry ingredients together until they're nicely combined and we're going to pop this aside while we deal with our last ingredient our final ingredient is Kofa now if you've never used Kofa before it's a basically a solidified vegetable shortening and we're going to use this to bind everything together now all we have to do is put it into the saucepan and we're going to melt it over a low heat and that's our Cofer melter now as you can see the copra doesn't actually have any color and it doesn't actually have any flavor what it does do is when we added into our dry ingredients it will combine with the cocoa and the icing sugar and it will create this incredible chocolate which will bind everything together so what we're going to do is take that off the heat we're going to allow it to cool for a few minutes and then add it into our dry ingredients time to add in the cocoa so it's going to gently pull that through lovely lovely lovely and just stir that through it's beautiful chocolate mixture emerging that's looking sensational now that beautiful wet chocolate bubble mix is ready to go into

you just want to eat all of that right now and they look delicious kind of it reminds me a little bit of an episode of How It's Made that's what chicken nuggets insides that like all good I mean that might be there actually what do you reckon Josh you reckon that looks good all right let's do it then so what I'm going to do so you need eight cups of dry ingredients okay so I'm going to stick in about seven and a half cups of you maybe I think those bags a little light so maybe go for six or seven cups of dry berries six to seven cups of dry ingredients depending on what your Josh says josh is certainly a cereal bar expert doesn't it look lovely could you keep mixing that for me Charlie yes of course don't worry if you crush them up a bit I think that'll be too quite tasty I've got here a chocolate orange so I'm gonna grate in some real-life actual chocolate chocolate oranges are the best link I don't know if you get them in other parts of the world but there are they're a UK classic and the way you open them is by tapping to unwrap so you go maybe on that so long and it should just all fall apart in a beautiful orange e-type fashion it's not worse oh no there we go are you segments this is going to be good I think I'm tempted to give it another couple of seconds in the microwave to melt the chocolate oh now I wish for Carrie's going yeah it's not that a bit crazy okay now we're gonna put some real orange zest in there I'm just gonna have to grate this over the bowl it's like a it's made of spider webs or something Isis really aunt it is I have put some spider webs in there that's the secret ingredient it's quite the workout guys if you wonder in how you get arms like Jimmy all this stirring I think this could we might have to use separate trays actually let's let's have a look do you just you just do what you need to do Jimmy that's not so good yeah it does smell delicious actually oh my word so you can wait for these to set or you could just sort of eat it right now if you wanted to yeah probably be pretty good too you're taking up the whole tree aren't you I'm nervous we might have to do separate trays Charlie I'm really sorry that's fine I think you know put this much effort in we deserve a space it's time okay well maybe Jimmy wants to try his own wager maybe that's part of fun maybe experiment in is why we have done this I mean I am in a massive mess well there we go guys that's the uncle Jimmy's chocolate orange cereal bar so they're gonna go in the fridge now for a little bit and we're gonna try them later on uncle Jimmy's Apple Cinnamon Cheerios bars didn't sanction this recipe I mean if we check if it works then yeah sure or I can come into the umbrella brand I'm a Peter MacKay just that confidence so I've got my Amy butter and Mimi marshmallow mix right here tell us about the back story charlie cuz I like the thought process behind you oh yeah so if you've never been to if you've never been outside of the United Kingdom I think these are just available in her in like in North America I had them in Canada Apple Cinnamon Cheerios undoubtably the best Cheerios you can possibly care don't have them here I'm gonna try and recreate that vibe first by adding some Cheerios which I have here we've got multigrain Oh your seems to be stirring together quite nicely actually thank you I think it's a by virtue of having kinda like a firmer cereal yes maybe you melted your marshmallow slightly more as well maybe who's to say hey maybe em just say look I know maybe I'm just a naturally talented when it comes to Syria but I'm not a cereal bar expert like Josh over there yeah so I'm just gonna grate some Apple directly into this let's go big Oh God see this is the stage where it starts of easy yet really quickly it's already saying oh ya know it would have been good to add in all the dry stuff at once wouldn't let me yeah yeah I've been really smart let's put some cinnamon in right now actually if I'm doing the staring right as well oh sure Oh cinnamon challenge mark to sound like the color that's coming out of that that's that's what chefs talk about all the time I like how that looks with your eyes yeah exactly high is a phrase that people say is it yeah I mean not literally spent figuratively don't try and eat with your eyes guys if you've got a bowl of cereal now don't just be going like that because that's definitely dangerous get them penny with it then and then and then some like that and then just plop in like all the Cheerios I've ended up on there what's that called on the fork the run wrong oh yeah yeah wrong you've ever played a tiny game of Queens with Cheerios laughs with the coins reference in Java what was I supposed to do Josh you doesn't know no spatula stuff well no that would work much better wouldn't it look a look at that perfect that's not ly all right well I'm gonna let that sit and then once it's refrigerated I'm gonna put some icing sugar on it - because I'm fancy well let's get tasting shall we so we're gonna start off with a bit of the old Alpen cereal bar yeah this is a curveball we prepared this earlier obviously Alpen is my favorite cereal so we thought is it cereal bar herbal know if there is an album bar so Josh made this one himself I'm gonna use a fork just because the texture of that is same it's not really a bar so much as like a reset it stays in some sort isn't it let's give it a go obviously health ALPA normally the healthy choice I don't know if it is when it's covered in marshmallow that's all I mm-hmm not good never made my favourite bit I don't even taste Anthony just taste like marshmallow with bits in the margin not always the perspective that ya know fail okay alright we're gonna look at mine next so here we go come out too bad charlie a bit of icing on top okay let's see how way they've set okay not sort of okay I'm gonna give it a 3 out of 5 on the crunch factor mm-hmm okey I'm yeah the cardboard II that's a shame they've been really stale hmm weird mm-hmm all right good tip watch out for using Cheerios there's no crunch there I really like the flavor the cinnamon is coming through I'm not getting much Apple it's very sweet no go I like that I think it's a shame that that one didn't work as well as I was hoping I've spoken to the CEO uncle Jimmy and he says with a bit of development that could work okay you think it could work I'll take it home all right let's have a look at the final one came out right yeah no presentation I think I've tried harder on this than anything else in my life everyone do you eat these so no that's just a decoration is decoration Charlie all right okay good crunch look at that look how well that is holding together I mean we went and maybe went a bit thick I sure could have probably laid a bit thinner but maybe that's the making your own cereal bars guys do it in whatever shape you want let's go hmm hmm yeah yeah mm-hmm could be a bit chocolatier yeah but the chocolate orange combination and then really makes that special he might be used to the cocoa pop you know thing but yeah this is ready really that's really nice that's a real bomb is what cereal in it does in a bar shake I think that's all you need to hear this oh I can't wait to finish all of that that's just so good great job cereal news broadcasting pop them together and what do you get I want like a metal version of that jingle to listen to whoa is that metal our first story this morning cereal is spiced and easy at the Kellogg's cafe this autumn so the callous Cafe in New York's Adair is get in the mood for autumn slash fall depending on your preference with a special pumpkin spice latte Bowl the custom cereal is made from frosted mini-wheats pumpkin spice cereal with

First, we want\u00a0\nto grease the 13 by 9 inch pan with coconut oil.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm using unrefined coconut oil so it\u00a0\nwill give it a slight coconut taste.\u00a0\u00a0 If you don't want that try using refined coconut\u00a0\noil. Cover your hand with a sandwich baggie,\u00a0\u00a0 dip your hand into the coconut oil and\u00a0\ngrab a little bit, and grease the pan. Set the baggie aside for use later. To a deep pot add 4 tablespoons of coconut oil and 10 ounces of mini marshmallows. Then\u00a0\nturn on your stove to low-medium heat.\u00a0\u00a0 Now to avoid everything sticking to the pan it's\u00a0\nprobably better to use a non-stick pan um, which\u00a0\u00a0 I don't own. The other option is to melt the\u00a0\ncoconut oil first and then add the marshmallows.\u00a0\u00a0 Here I'm being a little bit lazy and\u00a0\nI just add both at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0 Once the marshmallows start to melt\u00a0\nyou want to mix it pretty continuously. When they're all melted turn off your stove\u00a0\nand add five and a half cups of rice krispies. Using a wooden spoon mix\u00a0\nuntil everything is combined.\u00a0\u00a0 As the marshmallow cools you might\u00a0\nhave to strong-arm it a little bit but you should be able to get\u00a0\neverything mixed together. Then transfer everything to your greased 13x9\u00a0\npan and using your sandwich baggie from earlier\u00a0\u00a0 press the rice krispies down into the pan.\u00a0\nIf you notice that there's some missing\u00a0\u00a0 around the edges you want to grab it from\u00a0\nthe middle and push it to the perimeter. To finish I like to add some\u00a0\nChristmas-themed sprinkles. So just kind of sprinkle those\u00a0\nalong the length of the pan. And then using your sandwich baggie lightly\u00a0\npress them down into the rice krispies treats. And there you go. Cut the rice krispies treats\u00a0\nwhile they're still warm and then store them in\u00a0\u00a0 an airtight container for up to five days. They\u00a0\nalso store really well in the freezer.

taste memory not all first step this process is melting the butter and the marshmallows and the vanilla inside the pen throated burner to medium heat and drop your butter in the pen once the butter is completely melted you want to add a capful of vanilla at all your marshmallows and then you want to stir the marshmallows around until there's no more lumps and it's completed once the marshmallows are completely melted you see no lumps turn off the heat and add all of your rice puff cereal through the pen now you want to mix it all together until every single piece of the cereal is covered in the marshmallow mix okay well we've reached the perfect consistency and you know how I know that blend up with like spider web looking marshmallow threads like this that's when you know it's fully mix lay down a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper on the counter top and then you want to take all of your rice krispies mix and pour it on top try and spread it out as best you can now grab some more parchment paper or wax paper if that's what you're using and lay out another sheet over this sheet now using your hands at first spread the mixture to about an inch thick grab yourself a rolling pin it doesn't have to be a rolling pin it could be a bottle of liquor a wine bottle anything that's able to be rolled and smoothed out that's what you want to use and proceed to smooth out the mixture to a quarter of an inch thick all right well I think we've achieved about a quarter of an inch something like that now throw it in the fridge for about 20 minutes all right well this is our cold rice krispies treat now we're gonna take it to the next level I'm gonna show you how to make it cereal take off the first layer of parchment paper now what you want to do is cut it into small squares this is the bag that the cereal came in we're gonna repurpose it break up all your rice krispie treats and throw them into this back now you're probably thinking yourself all right [Music] this is a cup of powdered sugar you want to add it to the bag and then toss it all together and what that's going to do it's going to separate and keep them separated [Music] see they're all separated they're all covered in powdered sugar and you know time it is time to add this to a bowl mr. milk well that's it we snack back all the way to the rice krispies treats cereal and the best part is they still snap crackle and pop leave a comment in the section below if you want me to visit something that you can get in the grocery store and we can snack back to that together [Music]", "OOIgp2K2msA": "let's face

noticed that this box did not look exactly like this box and even if I didn't notice that box and this box were not the same I would have noticed that the cereal itself is very very very different now this cereal for frame of reference had giant clusters a rice krispies treats held together by marshmallow my goodness and this cereal had those ingredients like separated and that's not the same I'm really glad you threw the marshmallows in there because marshmallows are such an integral part of rice krispies treats but when they're not mixed with the rice krispies treats and like the rice krispies holding them together it doesn't really make sense it's just like rice krispies with marshmallows so Colin rice krispies sweets I don't think it's fair I think putting the same exact box in the same exact place where I got the old one at the same store uh isn't right I think you deceived us and it's okay and I want you to know that you made a mistake and I'm telling you this because I love you I love you and it's okay to make mistakes like look I make mistakes I made a mistake by buying this shirt it looks like I support you guys for making decisions like this but I don't you know I do support I support you guys for having a really great cereal and making really great decisions when you do but you know sometimes you change cereal formulas sometimes you discontinued cereals like s'mores when they're amazing when you could have just put them in bigger boxes and I would have bought it more but you decided like you know a nine point two or ten point two minus box was big enough that's what it wasn't mistake made that's discontinued but you know it one of these days I know you'll address that mistake again and it will come back hopefully in bigger boxes and I'm trying to give you the same opportunity to change rice krispies treats for cereal back to the older formula that way me and the rest of cereal community that fell in love with this cereal can fall in love with it all over again now whether you know this or not and I'm sure you do but I'd like to highlight it right now post change honeycomb cereal formula back in 2017 because I think honey was getting just a little too expensive for them to use it in that formula so like you know what we'll redo it we'll put a little less honey a little more sugar and no one will notice but guess what everyone noticed everyone complained No happy about it particularly the honeycomb elite right the people who would love honeycomb the most oh we did not like that change so after a lot of complaining on Twitter a petition on change.org that had around 4,000 signatures in a year after this decision Post decided to correct their mistake you know what they were greeted with they were greeted with such a warm reception we're like you know what post you did make a mistake but we love you and we care and we love our cereal so just I'm so glad you gave it back in Kellogg's do you have the same exact opportunity to change this bad boy and I mean bad and like nasty not bad in life good too this bad boy which clearly means good this is the best this sucks like please just please fix it it will appreciate you so much and if you could bring s'mores back in a bigger box I'd appreciate that you know it's the long shot doesn't really matter this is about rice krispies treats but I have a change.org petition that has over 2200 signatures and it's growing by day now this is just in three months I haven't even made a video about it so this I would imagine Garner's a lot more signatures a lot more attention towards a mistake that you guys made now if addressing your mistake in us having buying or us buying your cereal once again isn't enough for you then you know it might be enough having some stiff competition because General Mills is deciding to weaponize Lucky Charms with this bad boy and it's gotten hard but that exact same market because General Mills knows that if you're not paying attention to the people that actually talking care about your cereal then how are you relevant at all how are you gonna stay alive you can't so they didn't released this and it would be really great if they had this to compete with but they don't have this they have this yeah so I wanna let you guys know I love you it's the reason why I'm telling you this we love you we care and the offers on the table all you gotta do is just correct that mistake and we'll be here waiting hoping to buy the new cereal if we don't I'm sorry sake that just uh they'll be think be something we really don't like for a really long time okay so I appreciate your time thank you for listening and I really hope to hear from you very soon and I'll welcome you with just a open arms go on here get legs I mean you're here right my heart already just although we hug you but correct that mistake pretty pretty please and thank you sincerely cereal snob and the rest of serial community goodbye", "LxwAnAQyGkc": "time for a sweet treat the entire family will adore not only is it loved by kids it's probably loved more by their parents it's ridiculously simple to put together with only three ingredients and they're absolutely adorable it's time for some rice krispie squares on the one pot chef in a large heavy-based saucepan I've got 50 grams of unsalted butter you can use regular butter if you prefer I just prefer to use unsalted butter and sweet things just going to melt this over low heat until it's completely melted and the butters melted so into that I'm going to toss 300 grams of mini marshmallows just toss them straight in there's the rest of them and all we've got to do is stir them around get more slick tin that lovely butter and constantly stir it just keep them moving until they've melted and combined okay that's finished melting that's all smooth and combined now working quickly we're going to turn off the heat and we're going to pour in 200 grams of rice krispies or rice footballs or puffed rice cereal whatever you call it in your into the world and then just quickly stir it together I've got a large shallow baking tray here which I've just lined with some greaseproof baking paper and we're just going to quickly move this into the tray right I've spread that out into the tray so all we need to do is pop this into the fridge to set probably a couple of hours of most and then you'll be able to cut it up into squares and here we have our finished rice krispie squares they are absolutely gorgeous looking very pink but of course that's because I use both white and pink marshmallows if you want them to be white colored just use white marshmallows so let's have a taste mmm oh my god sweet and crunchy very strong vanilla flavor so nice YUM takes me back to my childhood well I hope you've enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one point chef show calm and until next time see you later you", "XrXgIaWvNO8": "all right today we are making healthy cereal bars for up fun New Year's Eve snack we are not making rice krispies treats good for you with all those marshmallows no no no no instead we are making a simple easy quiz delightful three ingredient healthier than rice krispies treat snack so we're starting with 2 cups of Cheerios in oco-2 that we will simply be adding half a cup of peanut butter and half a cup of honey that I'm going to microwave first so they get hot and running I can stir them together and then pour them into the cereal but let me show you this first now let me just say we know this is a super frugal treat because I got the Cheerios free couponing I got the peanut butter free from daddy's dumpster-diving I know you all love to hear that you think it's gross but it's not gross I just opened this new peanut butter today because I finished a jar with the peanut butter over here and I needed some more so I opened this one up peeled off the top and this is all the brand organic simply nature peanut butter the ingredients are just peanuts and some salt there's no sugar in here no corn syrup no nothing and it's organic and it was free from the dumpster yay so you know when you get your all-natural peanut butter you have that oil in the top and you're supposed to stir the oil back in okay well I don't do this I don't stir the oil back in what I do is and I think this is so clever of me and so frugal I pour the oil off into another little container so now I have some peanut oil and I can use that for anything that I might use peanut oil for like if I wanted to stir-fry some vegetables and the wok or if I want to pop up some popcorn in peanut oil then I have this peanut butter left - some of the oil now it makes this peanut butter drier and thicker but I'm ok with that because in my mind this now has become peanut-butter it's like all-natural peanuts - some of the fat it's a lower fat peanut butter isn't that cool clever and fantastic oh yes it is now this honey also was out of the Aldi dumpster and as you can see the lid is sort of broken but the little safety seal thing is still there so I think they threw it away because this probably fell and cracked off some of the plastic lid there's obviously nothing wrong with this honey I can't even get it open here we go opening it and of course honey is very very good for you in the realm of sweeteners certainly a lot better than refined sugar or corn syrup or marshmallows or whatever else you're gonna put in your cereal bars so so we'll pour some honey in here too up to the one cup mark and then I'm gonna microwave this so it's all hot and runny and stir ball and then we'll be able to pour it over the Cheerios mix it all together all right so I'm gonna pop this into the microwave for about 30 seconds we'll see if that's enough all righty there we are I put it in for 30 seconds and didn't feel like it was enough so I put it in for another 30 seconds at which point it was kind of foaming up and boiling in a scary sort of manner but I'll try to stir the peanut butter and the honey together when I've done this before I've heated them up together on the stove but I just thought the microwave is easier if you can do something in the microwave I just feel like that's easier and I think it uses less energy than turning the stove on and it seems to have done the trick because that's pretty runny now the honey and peanut butter mixed together so we're going to pour it in the cheerio Bowl and then we're going to mix all that together and then we're just going to press it into our little glass pyrex ditch there that I've sprayed some cooking oil in so that all this won't stick and we'll press it down in to that pan and we'll refrigerate it for a while and then later when we feel deserving of a snack we will cut it and give it a try just Pat it down in the pan obviously you could add anything you want to this to doll it up a little bit like you could put in some peanuts and you could I suppose put in raisins maybe chocolate chips or some M&Ms of course that wouldn't be as healthy but it would certainly be yummy I think this is a really nice treat for oh I don't know if you have some kids over for a playdate or you're having a slumber party or you just want something a little bit healthier in your kids lunchbox I mean obviously not healthier then I don't know an apple but healthier than a rice krispies treat or probably a commercially purchased granola bar so we're just gonna pop this in the fridge for a little while and let it firm up that was easy yeah I Damon let me try this cereal bar both girls found it a little bit too peanut buttery so I one could of course adjust the recipe to make a little less peanut buttery I thought it was too sweet so but there's a lot of honey in it but it's a more frugal and more healthy version of the rice krispies treat cereal bar type situation oh they're needy you like it peanut buttery so Navy you thought it was too peanut buttery yeah if you don't like peanut butter it's not gonna be your favorite thing daddy loves peanut butter so much he likes it yeah I liked it to it so you'll eat the whole pan of yeah I think they're really good too all right so if you have kids who like peanut butter obviously these are gonna taste peanut buttery they're not gonna taste like rice krispies treats because they're not marshmallow me they're peanut buttery we can have all of them you can have a whole ding-dong pan smile then", "kc6Rxp2YLcg": "serial-killer sweets is a rice-cereal marshmallow treat company created by

day of my 12 days of Christmas baking series in today's video we'll be making these reindeer rice krispies treats they're super delicious and super easy to make so let's get started so here I have a 9 by 13 inch baking pan and I'm just gonna spray that with some cooking spray and using a pastry brush I'm just going to distribute that evenly around the whole pan don't forget to do the sides in a large pot you're going to place that over medium-low heat and melt down 1/4 cup of unsalted butter once that is completely melted you can add 10 ounces or a wonderful bag of marshmallows and you want to use your spatula to just kind of toss these around so that they do not burn just continue tossing these around so soon enough it just start to melt down completely and once there are no chunks of marshmallows left we can go ahead and add our rice krispies cereal so you want to add 6 cups of that and you want to take it off the heat and then you want to stir this around try to distribute the marshmallow butter mixture as evenly as you can and try to do this pretty fast because the marshmallow will start to set once the marshmallows are able to hold their shape when you press them down you know they are ready so you can go ahead and place them into your baking dish I found the best way to do this was to grease your hands with some cooking spray and just press them into your baking dish [Music] so actually pushed my rice crispies more to one side because I wanted them to be a little bit more thicker but that's personal preference of course so here I have some semi-sweet chocolate I'm just gonna melt this down in the microwave at 30-second intervals until it is completely smooth and I transferred the chocolate into a pastry bag and I'm just gonna cut off a small corner I also greased the knife so that it won't get sickie when I'm cutting the Rice Krispies so now you want to cut your Rice Krispies I did about four rows by four columns but you can make them any size you want you should probably take this out of the pan before you cut it so you don't scratch your pan but let's just pretend that I didn't make this mistake so now I transfer these onto this really cute parchment paper that's very festive and just place that on there and this is what the finished product should look like but now we got it decorate so I'm using the melted chocolate and I'm just gonna pipe out little antlers I guess and you're gonna make three dots for the eyes and nose so I'm using these white eyeball candies I got from Michaels this is what they look like here you can also use white chocolate and use dark chocolate to make the little pupils so just place that on to your rice krispies and then for the nose I used a red M&M for a Rudolph of course and this is the finished product just repeat these with all of your rice krispies and that's it these are the perfect treats for this holiday season or if you just want to stuff your face with rice krispies I hope you guys have a happy holiday season and I'll see you guys in my next video bye everyone [Music]", "L52YFvL2EVY": "hello and welcome to easy gluten free today i'll be showing faith healthy recipes com how to make these chocolate cinnamon czech streets now most people know how simple it is to make rice krispies treats but they can be a little run of the mill so today I thought I'd use that same basic technique with both chocolate and cinnamon chex to bring new life to this classic treat the whole thing is done in just a few minutes using only five ingredients and these are perfect to make in the summer when you don't want to heat up the whole kitchen just to make a sweet treat all right to make these you're going to need three cups of chocolate chex three cups of cinnamon chex or you could just use six cups of whichever flavor you like better 1 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows if you wanted to use the larger ones they'll work but it'll just take a little longer 4 tablespoons of butter and 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips okay now to make these first you'll need to start to gather the chocolate and cinnamon chex so they'll be ready when you need them and have a 9 by 13 inch pan sprayed with nonstick spray now unlined my pan with parchment paper instead since I wanted to be able to lift them out and not cut them in the pan all right now in a large nonstick skillet over a medium heat add the butter and once it's melted add the mini marshmallows to the pan stir until the marshmallows are completely melted and well incorporated with the butter in this picture they're just about ready but there's still a few more that need to melt once everything's melted add the cereal to the pan and stir until the checks are nicely coated now pour the mixture into the prepared pan and using a buttered spatula press it down into a flat even layer at this point you really could just allow them to cool and eat them as they are but I took it one step further by melting six ounces of chocolate chips according to the microwave instructions on the package that I put them out the chocolate into a ziplock baggie sealed it up with a twist tie and snipped off a corner drizzle the chocolate over the top then once I had pretty even distribution of the chocolate i covered the surface with a sheet of plastic wrap and used the palm of my hand to press the chocolate into a more flattened layer a few hours later when the chocolate was set I removed the whole thing from the pan and cut it up to serve now this is a quick easy treat that's sure to be a big hit with kids of all ages so the next time you want an easy snack and don't want to heat up the kitchen why don't you throw together a quick batch of these there's just not that many desserts that are as simple as this one so I hope you'll give them a try and if you'd like to see the recipe in print you could always visit my blog and for additional recipes and tips to fit in with your healthy lifestyle visit my

the marshmallows butter fruit loops of course here you just see me adding butter to a saucepan on low heat and then I go ahead and add the marshmallows and then you just started up ah damn it Stanley any time you just keep stirring until it gets like super soft now I did make a mistake in the video we're using the adding the serial make sure you take the saucepan off of the heat because if not your microphones are gonna continue to no and you're not gonna have those marshmallow chunks like I want it to so just add your cereal in there you want more cereal than you want marshmallow well not too much I don't really not explain that I'm really measuring everything I tried to but I got aggravated and just threw everything in the pot so just mix everything together until it's well combined and then you're gonna see me put it all in a pan with parchment paper after that you're gonna then see me Pat it all down together [Music] you know just mold it into the shape as you wanted to and then let it set now marshmallows take these likely retreats take forever to settle I recommend leaving them overnight or at least 24 hours that way you know they're not so sticky to the touch and then you just cut it up into however small squares you want to and enjoy guys I mean that's pretty much it I'll have a video at the end of the final product [Music] [Music] [Music]", "77AJtOpZt54": "hi I'm Jenny Keller welcome to the Keller farmers kitchen today I'm going to show you how to make rice krispies treats on a stick dipped in chocolate this has been the number one request via blog post emails even friends saying how do I do that and well I feel like it's super simple it must not be so I'm going to show you guys how to do it and then you'll all think it's super simple too so the first thing you're going to need are the ingredients to make your rice krispies treats you probably already made these before but if you haven't you're going to need a bag of mini marshmallows I believe a deck of 10 ounce ten point six ounce bag and then six cups of rice krispies um half a stick of butter and a casserole pan and then either maybe some pan or I'm a huge fan of this bake easy spray from Wilton I use it all the time and then you're going to need candy melts which you can get just about anywhere in any color um we're gonna dip ours in pink I'll get to that a little bit later but you may need the candy color sorry I'm looking at the wrong one this is food coloring and this is candy coloring and then spatulas and sprinkles and all that but we'll get to that then so the first thing is to make the rice krispies treats now if you read a box rice krispies treats or even of agri marshmallows they always suggest that you put it in a saucepan but um I like fast simple quick easy and so I microwave mine so in a microwave-safe Bowl you're going to put your marshmallows in and your butter and if you're subscribed from my website I'm going to email you this recipe in any directions and tips that you need to make this at home if you are not subscribed you should go there now to go to the bottom of the page there's a little box that says stay in the note and you're gonna put your email in there and that way you will stay in the know with all my new recipes videos parties DIYs whatever so go there now and do this and I'm going to microwave this for about 40 seconds and I'm going to stir it in between and then maybe put it in for another 30 seconds and we'll meet back here so I microwave some marshmallows and the butter for about a minute and you can see that it's nice and runny it was so simple way easier than trying to do it on a stove and now I'm gonna add a little bit of my food coloring I love a mayor color I love Wilton whatever you on hand you're just gonna put a couple drops in remember pink though is one of those colors that you should probably use sparingly unless you want neon pink because I you know a couple right that is and it was just like the tiniest little dot whereas if you're making bread or brown you're going to use actually half a bottle so our marshmallows are covered in the pink and now you're going to add your rice krispies this is the point where if you have a husband or a dad or brother that's strong you should ask them to come out so that your arm doesn't fall off this won't work to mix all these hats but you have to mix it really good so that all the rice krispies treats get coated in the marshmallows sometimes using a bigger bowl was nice too because you know you don't have to worry about it falling out so while you're watching me mix and get tired um subscribe to my youtube channel so that you can be the first one to know when our next video comes out um another thing I have in my kitchen I have tons of in my kitchen or spatulas I believe that you never can have enough especially like when I'm decorating cookies for making different colors of icing it's nice to have um lots of spatula so that you have one for each bowl um I baked in other people's kitchens before and you know they like to spatulas and so I'm literally at the sink like rinsing them out between using each one so I have three spatulas today and I'm going to show you my trick for putting the rice krispies treats in your 9 by 13 pan okay my breath but my rice krispies are mixed now this is just a bowl of water breaker um them and show you how to use but I have this sprayed with the baby pea so nothing sticks now you're going to dump your rice krispies treats or your mixture into your pan and it's just such a pain to get this out so sticky so that's where the water comes in normally I will do this over at the sink but I just get my spatula I just drip it tiny bit and like look comes right off so you're not really getting your rice krispies wet you're just barely dipping your spatula and then um patting them down into your pan I like my rice krispies treats really back down um you know some people like there's a little bit more fluffy they may even use marshmallow cream in their rice krispie treats instead of marshmallows but since we're dipping our setae we want them to be pack down really firm so that they don't fall off the stick when we're dipping them in the chocolate but anyway this is a process you don't even have to work out if you do this because this is like a workout okay so they're in oh now you're gonna let this dry you don't want to cut into this right away let the marshmallow um cool off and then Harden and then you're going to cut it in two I think you can get about 16 rectangles out of this so we're gonna let this harden and then I'm going to show you how to dip it in add sprinkles alright so our rice krispies treats have hardened and they are ready to be dipped now am i I microwaved my candy mouths in a microwave-safe bowl look how nice and drippy they are I said this before in other videos I've done if your candy melts are really clumpy you can add a little bit of vegetable oil until you get a nice smooth runny candy mouth but just start teaspoon at a time just adding it in you don't want too much now I'm going to make mine pink I didn't have any pink candy melts on hand so I have candy color this is not food colorings don't put food coloring in your candy melts all your ruin all your chocolate but you just dip this in and I'm going to have all the you know resources where to get candy oil where to get the bake it easy spray lollipop sticks whatever you might need um on my blog but if you're subscribed to my website I will also send this recipe out and all those links to get any of the products so now we have a really pretty pink and I thought she'd have watch paper here um and I creat I'd my little bows on my sticks so you're just going to dip the tiniest bit into the chocolate and then it kind of just secures it so it's I do this when I do my cake pops ooh it just helps um the stick to adhere to the rice krispies treats now you don't have to tie bows on your sticks if you're running low on time or you don't like bows um but people make your life a lot easier if you tie the bows on to the sticks before you do this or else you'll be like trying to tie a bow around force krispie treats and remember when you guys are watching this that even though I'm making pink rice krispies treats with pink bows you can always swap out the colors on this I mean you may even want to just keep your rest crispy treats the natural color in my book eat more dessert I have really really cute rice krispies treat ice cream bars that I made um very similar to this but instead of a lollipop stick I have a popsicle stick and I give them in sprinkles and cut out kind of the corner to UM kind of make it look like there was a bite taken out of it I've also done these in like green with black for a Ghostbusters party I did one year so anyway um you know remember that it's very versatile and the one thing I love about having it on a stick is this it's so great for little kids you know their hands are getting messy okay couple more so I think I said that last little segment that we need 16 and I was right you're going to get 16 rice krispies treats out of this batch now this feels too big you can always have these and get 32 okay done so by the time you got all of those dipped into its crispy treat this first one is probably dry so you're just going to take your little rice krispies treat and you're going to dip it down into the candy melt about halfway and then you're just going to want to let that excess kind of drip off and then I kind of just use this out of the bowl to get rid of any drips and then I'm just going to sprinkle with sanding sugar over the chocolate and let it stand to dry and I have two different kinds of sprinkles here don't want to go down all the way come on to let that drip off hit the excess and then you could do a brighter this is kind of fun because it looks like kind of ombre you like that trends over but still cute in rice krispie treats another thing that's really cute to do with the same idea um is to make these look like a paintbrush if you were having like an art party or you know something with kids and paint um maybe you're having a tangled party she liked to paint you could make little paintbrush rice krispie treats with different colors of candy mel thought you might be a little bit more work to melt different colors but anyway okay I definitely like the brighter color pink butter but this is how it's done so again subscribe to my youtube channel if you're not already a subscriber to

didn't think that i [ __ ] [ __ ] he's waving his plate oh my god bro i took it to the ah [ __ ] bro that's not i don't even want to talk about it no more let's continue on but i like to prep my [ __ ] first so i'm uh which i know everything i'm gonna show you everything i'm doing down here yeah but uh measure up five cups of this [ __ ] for me i did not get the large size but that's why i'm [ __ ] instacart man [ __ ] i said the family should they get well i'll be one punch i've been wanting to punch so what i like to do is pre-measure my [ __ ] i got a ziploc bag for me i'm gonna put the um damn cereal and give me five cups sorry if you could hear the um if you can hear or see anything i'm doing in the background with cannon butter and [ __ ] like that my [ __ ] hey mind your business yeah we gonna do it like that one cup do that five times all right so this is five cups of pure [ __ ] [ __ ] um fruity pebbles oh [ __ ] but then there's enough for me why the [ __ ] do i keep saying

gay man if you gay do you man i really don't give a [ __ ] for me yeah now we gotta get to the melting for me but uh i need three teaspoons of this [ __ ] well tablespoons tablespoons don't let me [ __ ] you up three tablespoons of that [ __ ] yeah i'm gonna take y'all over to the pot right now it might be a little less light but yeah we bout to go over it i got the i got the oven on six right now i mean oven i'm bugging out today bro what the [ __ ] i got the skillet on on uh six today you feel me we need three teaspoons three tablespoons of this coconut oil one huh you still got some more to spare make some hot cheetos with this later if you want me to show you how to make edible hot cheetos just let me know in the comments okay now take your marshmallows that big ass panda mellows throw that [ __ ] on there throw that [ __ ] on oh yeah that's all in there all the good [ __ ] now you want to get you a spoon for me start mixing start mixing even before this [ __ ] hot because these shits melt fast and uh you don't want to get the can of butter i mean uh the coconut oil is too hot you for me so have it on a low heat i put it down to four at this point one again i have a low heat it's already starting to melt it's already starting to melt together [Music] [Music] all right let's get in there we on the way this is not melted enough i wish i could see the [ __ ] green and [ __ ] in here some people do this [ __ ] with their hands i don't know how my [ __ ] yeah get this [ __ ] to basically consistency like that or you can't see like the solidness of the marshmallows anymore i'm gonna take that [ __ ] off the heat yeah yeah i see that see that [ __ ] all right you get that for me put that right here real quick i hope you can see me put that right there real quick get you a bowl all i got is this [ __ ] this [ __ ] i finally got at least one one guy give me this it's something for me they get cereal for that [ __ ] in there now put all of this [ __ ] in there all that i see all of this [ __ ] is infused marshmallow so i would get all of this [ __ ] you don't want to waste none of that chicken here all right that's about all i can get out that [ __ ] that's all infusion you get us into your dog or something if you like getting your pets off and now most people do this [ __ ] with their hands bro i'm not about to do this [ __ ] with my hands so just get a spoon start mixing start mixing all right at this point you're basically done my guy but now this all depends if you like it gooey or not i like it a little less gooey so i'm gonna add a little more cereal just like that for me get back to stirring she's gonna get a little hard to stir when you get this [ __ ] all together real hard to [ __ ] stir all right i should be all right now pretty much the gist of it but now you gotta make them into bars if you want to eat this [ __ ] just by itself like this have fun you probably be high as [ __ ] get some wax paper look at the size of the pan [Music] through the pan out of here basically just line it on top before me want this [ __ ] in here oh actually just came out the bowl now smooth it out for me make it into bars this [ __ ] is sticky so it might be a little hard just take your time for me there's no rush that's on real quick cause this hand is biggest [ __ ] to add a wall right here yeah this pan a little too big so i basically made a little pan out of the big pan it's not like we're putting this [ __ ] in the oven but it's going in the fridge yeah see that it's not sticking as much you're good flat in it yeah i know it's been a damn i've been doing this [ __ ] for a minute yeah hey after you get this [ __ ] to the size you want it's pretty good that [ __ ] does take a minute because this [ __ ] is sticky as [ __ ] i don't really need this anymore the move just to make like this part flat as you can see the side yeah these shits are gonna be poking as [ __ ] like these are going to be small squares each square is going to be oh my god yeah now you just basically put it in the fridge until it hardens i'll cut it in uh which i see what it looks like at the end she gonna rap for [Music] but yeah that's pretty much the gist of how you make it yeah i hope you enjoyed the vid i hope y'all make this you know on your own if you want to know how to make coconut oil you feel me uh just let me know i can make a video on that it's a little different from butter but not much and um it actually takes less time to make it and it's actually more strong it's actually stronger not more stronger it's actually stronger because it has more saturated fat money i can go into that science [ __ ] all day or whatever the [ __ ] it's called but you pull me but yeah you got more [ __ ] and [ __ ] like that so if you want to learn how to make that uh just let me know if you want to know how to make hot cheetos let me know i'm about to make that in a second for me so yeah yeah [ __ ] with the kid before me [ __ ] with my second channel my main channel all of that if you want to um if you want to follow me on instagram all of that um all my stuff is gonna be in the description so just hang me up snap everything so yeah about to get up out of here we here", "ki7V1boxoDI": "yo what up everybody its peace I today we're going to be making some rice krispie treats kind of thing I have some cinnamon pebbles here I thought they were chocolate but their cinnamon so what we're going to do it anyway I bought two marshmallows so this should be good and some cookie butter I'm going to put this in there we're going to see how it tastes okay so come on let's go oh ok next we're going to melt a stick of butter which is a half cup of butter with about a half a cup of the cookie butter and this is going to be the base of what we're going to be melting our marshmallows in and this is just a medium pan over medium heat we like things medium around here yeah just stir that all and make sure that butter is completely melted and that cookie butter as well all right after it's been melted we're going it to add about 10 ounces of marshmallows you want to have the same amount of marshmallows as you have cereal in the box of cereal is about time i believe it was 11 ounces so yeah you want to have about the same amount of marshmallows as cereal for this type of treat oh yeah you just basically want to get this all melted and mixed together and once you have that done we're going to pour our cereal in so yeah alright so this is the type of consistency we want see very smooth almost creamy so we're going to do now is we're going to pour in all of our cereal oh wow very cinnamony certainly be interesting all right full box so make sure your pan is big enough their bowl or whatever or what's this thing called pop pop all right and you know you just got to get in there and hold it in at this point it's on a very low key we just want to heat it up a little bit more make sure that the marshals are still running I will need to answer this and finally we're going to take all of this mixture and put it into a lightly greased pan lined with foil or parchment paper all right after we put in the pan we pressed it down a little bit and what we're going to do is just let this cool at room temperature for a while probably about an hour and then we're going to cut into it and cut it into squares

bars but I opted out the Rice Krispies because I don't have rice krispies I decided to show you guys how I make it because I'm gonna be making some for my co-workers and hope you guys try it out so far the ingredients you will need miniature marshmallows and you touch bottom work bag of cornflakes pure vanilla extract and unsalted butter very simple for dreams so the first thing you want to do is just heat um some water if you have to it is a little smile so the water is spoiled and I just have all my ingredients out and ready we're gonna be putting the marshmallows in with the butter I'm just gonna put the metal part of this book I'm gonna using this bunch of marshmallows I'm making a lot I actually use half the bay so with that I'm going to put about four tablespoons of unmelted butter I also turn the heat to low to medium low so that I'll melt the butter slowly so once the butter is all melted I'm going to be adding the marshmallows so I just laid a strip of parchment paper on the side to prepare it's all melted so I'm just going to add my mushrooms these can't pour it in and fix it so you know when it's ready when all the marshmallow is melted and gooey so once it's like this I usually add the vanilla extract so I don't really measure I'll just put like maybe a teaspoon bless you so I added in the vanilla extract yep it's done shut this off you take this out so while it's still really hot you just pour you're poor flakes in it so give it a really good stir so they definitely add more cornflakes to this so basically I really just eyeball everything it sounds really simple so you don't really need to make there any things that's your preference if you want more marshmallow just add less more flakes but if you want more cornflakes and more of the crunch keep adding more you already see that it's kind of like getting really sticky so that's when you know that everything's coated especially when you see all the corn flakes covered with the gooey goodness so next make sure your parchment area is clean which mine is on is kind of wet but anyways good I'm pouring the delicious - delicious mixture onto my parchment paper and voila it's done you could actually just use it right now the next thing that you want to do to saran wrap this so no dust and everything will get on it so now that goes down could either use up parchment paper and roll it up or if you use ceramic so I'm going to use irreverent No let's go back all this up hope you guys enjoy this video anyway I'll show you by little cute apron cuz my sister got it for me as a little bow isn't it cute my sister got it for me for I guess a housewarming or wedding day gift I don't really know but thank you is from Anthropologie it's a super cure I rarely even use it because I know it's super expensive and I don't want to get dirty it's kind of like too cute so decided to wear it and show you guys and what else has a cute red waste line with polka dotted features okay gang angry alright this is his anger tone Isaac", "Am1dsu5zfCg": "hi guys so today I'm going to show you how to make these delicious chocolate caramels rice krispies treats rice krispies treats are one of my absolute favorite desserts and I actually just recently baked for a friend's wedding and I wanted to kind of jazz me up a little bit because it was one of the things that we had on the dessert bar so I thought adding the caramel and chocolate kind of gives it that extra kind of special touch to it to kind of have it as a fun dessert so let me show you how I made them so in order to get started I'm just going to take my 9 by 13 pan and I'm going to line it with some parchment paper alright so now we're going to start it and make the rice krispies treats so you're going to have a big pot and we are going to put it on low heat and then to this we are going to add our three tablespoons of butter now we're going to add 10 ounces of marshmallows which is usually one of the standard small size bags I've got a big bag here so I'm just going to use half of this right up throw these in here okay so we're going to let this um kind of all melt together you can start on low heat and then sometimes if I'm carefully watching it I will bump it up a little bit to low to medium heat we're just going to let this sit so now that the butter and the marshmallows have melted together I am going to turn off the heat and then we're going to add seven cups of rice krispies cereal to this the original recipe usually asks for six cups but I like seven cups I just like the ratio of the rice krispies treat some marshmallow better in that scenario so so it's all mixed together so now I'm going to kind of dump this into my pan with the parchment paper so you're gonna let it cool for a second and while that's sitting you are going to take a little bit of butter and actually a better your hands so you can press down the rice krispies treats so it's a little bit of a messy dessert to prepare but fun at the same time so that it doesn't stick to you so now it's pretty not too hot to touch so now you're just going to spread it all out evenly so now the rice krispies used to ready to go I'm going to pop it in the fridge and then we're going to move on to melting the caramel so while your rice krispies treats are in the fridge kind of chilling off I'm going to get started and it smelt the caramel so in another pot or pan you are going to set this one also to a low heat so then you're going to add up 14 ounces of caramel which is about one bag full so I'm just going to put these in my pan so then to your caramel you're going to add two tablespoons of water it's just going to help kind of smooth out the caramel wallet melts and then you are you're going to let that go and melt over a low heat until it's all nice and smooth and creamy so the caramels all melted I'm going to grab my rice krispies treats out of the fridge and we're going to pour that on top so you're going to pour on the caramel and then you're just going to kind of smooth it out with your spatula to the edges and get an even coat all over the top of the rice krispies treats so your caramel is all good to go we're going to pop this back in the fridge and while that's chilling a little bit we're going to melt the chocolate for the top so next we're going to melt one bag of chocolate chips I like to use semi-sweet you can use dark chocolate if you like a fat version better but you're just going to need one bag which is about 12 ounces and then again in another saucepan you're just going to heat it to a low to medium heat and then you're just going to want to constantly watch it and stir it as the chocolate melt so now I just pulled the caramel layer out of the fridge and I'm going to add our last and final layer which is the chocolate to get a really smooth layer on top I'll pour all the chocolate out use the spatula to get to the edges and then I just like to tap it out and it helps to kind of really get that even coat so now we are going to pop this back into the fridge and let it chill completely so that we can cut into it so I just took it out of the fridge now that the chocolate has completely chilled and I'm actually just going to kind of pop it out of this pan that's why I like using the parchment paper because it's kind of really easy to to take it out just gonna kind unwrap it and then you can kind of see our little bit of our our layers that are in there so now I'm just going to cut this into squares the best time to do this is right where you take it out of the fridge you can also pop it into the freezer for a couple minutes and then take it out just so it helps to make sure that the bar is really solid while you're cutting into it so my friends and family are big fans of this desert and hopefully yours will be too and if you want to see more recipes make sure you subscribe to the channel and follow me on I am light-hearted calm", "DrSRyvCfUlo": "peanut butter cup rice krispies treats hello everyone first thing you're gonna do is open or MRAP 24 Reese's peanut butter cups and make sure you remove the little paper liners now at the store that I bought these out it was cheaper actually to get them in stock sizes that day so that's why they're all individually wrapped set those aside and move on to the next part of the recipe that's 7 cups of miniature marshmallows into that we're gonna add 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I'm using creamy but you could use chunky as well now I put this in the microwave for about 2 minutes until the marshmallows are nice and puffy and melted and the butter and peanut butter have also melted and you're gonna stir that together until it's nice and smooth if you don't want to use a microwave you can do this in a large pot over low heat on the stove as well now add in 7 cups of rice krispies cereal and stir it until the cereal is completely coated and then you're gonna take half of that cereal and put it in the bottom of a 9 by 13 inch greased baking dish and then spread it out using a buttered spatula or your fingers that have been lightly dampened with water and they won't stick at all spread that out and quickly add your peanut butter cups you're gonna spread them out evenly over the surface of that first half of the rice krispies treats work fairly quickly because the rice krispies treats set up pretty fast now take the second portion of the mixture and place it on top of the peanut butter cups and gently spread it out and Pat it down until it's nice and smooth using your fingers or a buttered spatula now we're gonna make a great topping that is a 1 and a half cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and an additional 2 tablespoons of peanut butter I put this in the microwave for about a minute to a minute and a half until it was melted stirred it all together and then you're gonna spread it on top of your cereal bars then put it in the refrigerator and allow it to set completely before you cut it into squares and if you love peanut butter and chocolate as much as I do you will love these rice krispies treats they are delicious lots of great peanut butter

Krispies candy I'm just doing Cocoa Krispies because I like the Cocoa Krispies better and what I've got is I've got 40 marshmallows here I've counted them out you got to make sure that you do a good marshmallow too right I always like the crap jet puffed marshmallows and I've got a stick of margarine in here and it's melting and I'm gonna go on and put the marshmallows in and I've cut my heat down on here now to 230 which would be like between your medium and your medium-low and I'm gonna melt these marshmallows enough so it's I said 40 marshmallows the jet puffed kind and I've got 4 cups of Cocoa Krispies and if you're gonna make Rice Krispies candy or Cocoa Krispies candy get good kinds of of the Rice Krispies or the Cocoa Krispies I mean I've used some of the store brands and they're not a lot of times you can get store brands that taste like the item that you want but you I can't find any store-brand rice krispies that tastes like rice krispies or Cocoa Krispies so I've got Kellogg's Coco rice Cocoa Krispies and I'm melting my marshmallows you can do this on your stove I'm just doing it in my using my induction my NuWave induction cooktop and I want all of my marshmallows to melt into like a cream a marshmallow cream and that's what's going to hold this out together is melting these and you need to do this kind of bit of slow so I've got it down to 210 now which is almost at a medium low and I want these to melt into to make sure that there's nothing left nope no big chunks like that I want it to be totally melted all right so I'm gonna bring you back when this gets totally melted and I'll and show you what we're gonna do from here okay I'm back and the marshmallows of all mounted and I'm taking it off the heat because you don't want to keep it on the heat or it'll burn the marshmallows and I'm putting in 6 cups of cocoa krispies that was for now I've got to get 2 more cups you see Emmys in a wooden spatula alright there's the two other pups and now I'm just going to stir this all up and I've got my pan over here I've sprayed it with spray and you want to mix this all up so that this marshmallows and the rice krispies are all coated and all mixed together and my grandkids absolutely love Rice Krispies candy or the Cocoa Krispies candy and I do too and this is just an easy quick thing for you to make and it's not hard at all and your kids can help you or if you're a teenager or your mom will let you use your stubs you can do it yourself it's like I said you just got to make sure that it's all mixed together and mixed in good alright now the next thing I'm going to do is I've got I'm gonna move this back I move my tripod back because I want to get my pan over here like I said it's been sprayed just make sure that this is all mixed up together in here looks like it is this smells so good so now I'm just gonna pour it in my fan and if you don't have vegetable spray or whatever you can take a stick of margarine or butter I'm real picky about y'all know I don't like butter and the other day I went somewhere and they had rice krispie treats and I tasted them and they had used butter will that wind the whole thing for me the whole thing because butter in rice krispie treats to me is terrible and once your pan close off if there's rice krispies treats wept you can let your kids get in there and get the rest of the lick the pad the pan so to speak all right so what I'm doing is I'm gonna go on and get my vegetable spray and I'm just gonna spray my fingers with this so I can push this candy down because it's really sticky but I want it push down in here because once this cools you want to be able to eat it I mean to cut it so you can't eat it so push it down try to get it as even as you can my kids like it warm and so do I so this is so good if you've never tried the the crispy the Cocoa Krispies you've got to try this all right you can see this now I've got to let it cool off and then I'll cut it and I'll bring you back and show you what it looks like it already tastes amazing but I'll bring you back in a little while okay I'm back I've got a mild cut up and they're on a serving tray and what I do now is I just cover them up with some this is a glass serving tray so I've got them I'm covering up with some plastic wrap and you can either just sit them over to the side or you can put them in the

and they're frightfully fantastic they're so cute all right well you're a big sub-tree I'm ready let's get started first thing is going first thing you're gonna do is prepare your fan the first step the first step is going to be to prepare your pan we have a 9 by 13 dish right here that's right you can use your favorite casserole dish this is mine it could be glass it could be ceramic whenever you'd like to prepare it you're gonna spray line it and then spray again just to make sure because these are really sticky yeah I'm gonna spray this hold your breath and just line it with parchment paper I'm always placing it in there and I like to leave some sides up it makes it easier to take down we have the Krispies have hardened yeah if it's taller than the pan it makes it so much easier now spray it one more time and set it off to the side there we go oh boom before we start baking I just want to let you know that I'll be leaving all of the ingredients and the measurements in the description below so go check it out there and our next step isn't taking our marshmallows large saucepan and butter over the stove we're gonna melt them together delicious okay now we have our marshmallow butter mixture over here and we're gonna add our peppermint and green food coloring while it's still warm yeah and the pan is hot so just be careful don't touch it Molly porting here's some peppermint and then just a couple of drops of green food color till your desired color whatever color monster you'd like and then mix it around oh it looks so good and then once the color is mixed in we're gonna add our crispy cereal here we go coredegon ready I'm gonna make a rain cereal make it rain make your grace you did gently all together Molly this is good practice for we need have a kid because no longer used to make these all the time for us oh yeah so now you all know how to make him for baby mo has not told me what the name of the baby is yet I think I think she's know it though I think so she's I totally keeping it a secret from me her only sister her favorite sister in the whole world her best friend sister you know what I think you should do Instagram followers choose your baby name yes then once the cereal is combined with the marshmallows you're going to gently fold Ain the little mini chocolate chips okay this even looks creepy look at all these like little bite we just just do a little a taste just a little you just have to take so there's nothing peppermint in there oh my gosh Oh fresh meat rice krispies treats are we kidding this is so good I might have to make a second batch it's okay if the chocolate chips melt a little you're gonna decorate on top of it no you keep mixing I'll go get her a little casserole dish okay okay once it's mixed together you're going to scoop it into your casserole dish I'm gonna tell before you eat it all you call that I'll scoop it oh okay here we go here we go it's okay if it looks messy because we're gonna press it down oh my god you know we're not gonna have any monsters left Molly they're so good oh my goodness when baby mo is born can I make them just first birthday cake yeah don't love that I don't eat tell me what flavor he wants if he can't even talk do we do like hand signals like if you do this for vanilla this for chocolate this for mint chocolate chip this for funfetti you just have a lot of taste testing you do it them some things have a lot of research to do it with a baby I'm gonna be like baby what flavor do you want mo did a great job using a spoon or you can use a spatula to flatten the Krispies but a fun tip you can take a greased piece of parchment paper put ice on top of your Krispies and press flat to get them really fluffy this is really good if you're gonna decorate them later like we are putting the face on and then peel it off once it's flattened we're gonna set it aside and let it cool completely for about 25 minutes this is the hardest part of this recipe is not to eat them cuz you can smell them okay yeah oh whatever for the 25 now that our rice crispies have completely cooled we're going to take them out and then cut them into the little bars that are gonna do the whole face yeah little rectangles this recipe should make about 12 rectangle krispies I'm gonna be making two cuts down the long way right here and here and then three the short way one two three and the ones at the end I'm just gonna cut them to make them more square like you're probably I'm just gonna cut them okay cuz then I can eat the leaves oh it's making more sense now rectangles are cut and now it's time to decorate it it's my favorite time now we are ready to decorate so over here and a piping bag I have some royal icing dyed green with a number 3 tip at the end for a little bit more control we are going to pipe an outline all the way around the top of the crispy treat so relaxing to do this I love this once the outlined icing has hardened fill it in the outline has set we are gonna fill it in and blend them yeah this is called flooding flooding a cookie and in this case it's flooding a crispy then do this to all of your Krispies again we've let the icing set and now it's hardened and now it's time for the hair we have the melted chocolate in a bowl and we're gonna take our Krispies and dip them in about an inch to get the monsters hair line I really like this bowl because you can't go too deep so you just dip the crispy and let the excess chocolate drip off into the bowl doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo just give it a little shake and then just place it onto a piece of wax paper to dry and then do this to the rest of your treats we've left the chocolate hair set and now it's time for the monsters cute little face and you don't have to wait that long because chocolate sets very quickly so you can get on with your decorating and we just put some of the melted chocolate into a decorating bag with a number 2 tip on it so just take a little bit and put a DAB on the back of the candy eyeball and then place onto your crispy treat then use your melted chocolate to pipe on a little mouth and eyebrows to give these little monsters some expressions and you can do anything you want like this one he's more concerned Oh what's he worried about probably eating yeah yeah that's a valid concern it's like that can definitely happen within the next minute look at him oh he's like Oh rows behind me all day now be the final decoration step we are gonna put little marshmallows on the side of the Krispies to look like the bull his little bald cat cuter so we're just gonna take one of these mo and a small sharp cutting knife be careful don't get your fingers and cut a little marshmallow in half you want to make sure they don't fall off so just take a little bit of royal icing I like to use the world icing you could also use chocolate but I like it because it's also green so it blends in really well then just attach it on the side of the crispy treat near the bottom so it looks like it's coming out of his neck then do this to the rest of your monster tree oh my God he's so cute look he looks petrified that you're gonna do crispy treats that we've made today the recipe is from my new cookbook baking all year round and there are so many Halloween recipes on it but I'll put a link down below to where you can go find that and

here's the sad part about smelling this it smells just like every other like granola bar or a cereal bar or whatever those like one of those nature bellies does but it doesn't really smell like Reese's or pee it kind of smells like peanut butter my disappointment smells are highlighted my smells are disappointed is what I meant to say well obviously I had a stroke I mean I said the count oranges today so you what what what happened anyway Jeff you ready to take your first bite I took the rest for later okay I'm just gonna eat the whole thing right now do you ever put stuff in your pocket like thinking you'll remember them later and it just melts you get excited when you get them yeah I'm waiting for you yeah I don't know I'm late you gotta warn me that's terrible now we feel it you can sleep disappointed I'm getting the vibe of badness here I'm gonna try this it's bushed oh it's like this they came up with this because somebody at Reese's puffs factory accidentally put me look at a bunch of reasons buffs and it made it soggy I oh shoot what do we do with this now okay this is just like a crushed up soggy Breezies pump it's not good could be crunch here all right a little bit it's they won fair like chewy Nature Valley flavor when they should call it crunchy nature value right which are really different kinds of things this is kaya it's yeah it's mushy I feel like a hint of like British pop you know what this is got it okay crispy crispy what I call it crispy and you've tried those Reese's those Reese's Crunch Bars that they sell at like gas stations that are like like just Reese's but they're kind of like the Butterfinger like a butterfingers of his free C's no they're like Reese's crunch and they're like candy bars that's like the ins this is like the inside of that without the crunch this is Rice Krispies 100% I'm gonna say is Rice Krispies this is Rice Krispies there's a Reese's peanut butter on it yes and some chocolate on it too it's not good I've quite disappointed what do you get out of them I give it to what is it no like my roaches are a - let's put it this way I like last week's taco cheese it's better I see what you did there I give this a 3.5 out of time okay wait wait you put cockroaches at two and this is only a 1.75 five above it there's a clear line there's a clear line all right all right since you said that maybe a fork went by okay I stopped what's what's a base line five out of ten for you this was just across the board five out of ten for you like a regular good granola bar that's a five out of time to find your scale I mean I just like other things more like hot wings or hot wings there are ten good hot wings what about Chipotle it's like a nine out of ten oh my gosh what's a one out of ten for you cheese Jesus like I'm eating this Jeff and I feel like it's just a waste of calories what's why are you still eating I don't know are you a relative so what so one out of ten is cheese or bugs or buzz yeah same thing I put the Engel at equal value would you rather eat it enter a piece of cheese I'd rather eat a single ant I got enough same size ants as a cheese single I really eat a slice of cheese then slice the cheese has to be above a 1 all right fine it's at a 1.1 I think we guys thanks for watching time to taste I'm Dave Moore that's Jeff Daly if you guys enjoyed this if you guys want to try these they're and grocery stores I don't know why eat I wouldn't recommend them and if you love Reese's puffs you love what is very suppose you're under that level what's happening at my mouth you're not gonna be happy you're gonna be slightly disappointed I think thanks for watching guys hit that subscribe button if you guys like these thanks for watching t2t with JD and hey guys Johnny casino here and oh man uh I went out to dinner tonight I'm on the road so I went to a restaurant I sat by myself it's a really weird thing for me to go anywhere and sit by myself so I said at the bar also helped him plan on having a beer now looked at the menu and there's chicken and waffles and I have never had chicken and waffles and I've had a number of people recommend it to me from this specific restaurant so what did I try to do I tried to eat chicken and waffles this place doesn't a little bit different maybe I don't know how it is traditionally but they have kind of a sriracha sauce that goes in with the syrup if you've never had or seen chicken and waffles I put a picture of it up on Twitter here but they basically take a piece of fried chicken or in this case two pieces of fried chicken and put them on top of the like belgium waffles and then they put syrup on it holy crap guys it was so good it was so good um it was a lot I'm stuffed I can barely move I was gonna take this video while eating it while taking that first bite but this place is just I don't know I felt weird I kind of lost my nerve I chickened out if you will but oh my god it was so good so I took that first bite you know I cut into the chicken and made sure had some waffle had some chicken and the syrup on it and I tasted it and man that syrup just does something for that chicken now let's talk about the waffle part for a second do you really need a waffle to go with this I mean health-wise obviously not right this is maybe the most unhealthy meal I've ever eaten but to me do you need a waffle to go with your chicken if you had the chicken and the syrup in the sriracha sauce which give it that little bit of heat then you be said and I was thinking about this while I was eating and then I took a bite and I was kind of savoring it just a little bit and I realized if the waffle itself has just a little bit of sweetness to it and that little bit of sweetness was amazing so it's the whole thing it's the chicken the waffle the syrup this case the sriracha mixed in oh man it was amazing uh but like I said I'm hurting I am stuffed off this my other concern going into this was that I was gonna be having a beer with it and beer and sweet stuff beer and breakfast I mean for some people beer breakfast goes hand-in-hand for me mayera breakfasts not hand-in-hand so I was concerned but the beer I was drinking was a coffee milk stout and so it actually paired with it quite well I I didn't realize that when I ordered the beer they ordered before I decided what I was gonna eat but it paired well it worked great I had a great meal I wish I could have videoed the first thing of you know me taking the bite but nope not gonna do that not gonna shoot a video like this in the middle of a restaurant even though it's into the bar not gonna happen uh anyways if you haven't a chance fried chicken waffles try some chicken and waffles find a good place that does it if you've got a place there's a sriracha sauce with it do it it's the way to go thanks guys out some more great discussions hit that subscribe button or visit forget being cool calm", "xoMfT-LBDwI": "[Music] [Music]

butterscotch baking chips some semi-sweet chocolate chips and I picked up the mini a bag of the mini kind by mistake instead of the regular sized ones but it worked out just fine some vegetables cooking spray box of rice krispies cereal smooth or crunchy peanut butter white granulated sugar and some karo light corn syrup [Music] you need a large bowl mixing bowl to put the rice krispies in and a nine by 13 pan and so I'm just spraying both of these with vegetable cooking spray sprayed the ball and the nine by 13 pan [Music] measure out six cups of the Rice Krispies cereal into the mixing bowl and then next you're going to measure out one cup of peanut butter just into a measuring cup and you can use smooth or chunky peanut butter it's your preference next one cup of white sugar and one cup of light corn syrup goes into a pot a heavy pot [Music] mix the two ingredients well and put on a medium heat and bring it to a boil when it comes to a rolling boil then you need to pull it off the heat and we're going to add the peanut butter next the longer you boil this mixture the drier the bars will be [Music] [Music] I'm adding the peanut butter in and mixing it well I got this recipe years ago from my good friend Margie who's a really good cook so shout out to Margie next you poured the peanut butter mixture over the rice krispies and then mix that together well then it goes into the 9 by 13 pan that I sprayed with cooking spray and you try to put it evenly in the pan without packing it down too much as you don't want it to be too dense and hard to eat I sprayed the back of a spoon with some cooking spray to help me spread the mixture more easily I might have packed these in too tight but you'll do better than I did I left this out on the counter to cool I then measured out one cup of butterscotch chips and one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips into a glass bowl and I waited until the treats were cool before I started melting the chocolate i melted the chocolate on a low power in the microwave a minute at a time stirring after each minute until it was completely melted and stirred into nice creamy frosting it took about three to four minutes total time to do this use a low setting on the microwave because you don't want the chocolate chips to burn you mix the butterscotch chips and the chocolate chips together well and then spread them over the top of the cooled rice krispies and I put these in the freezer for about ten minutes so that it would set up quickly after the frosting or topping has set up he cut them into bars and voila you have peanut butter rice krispies treats it made enough that I was able to share them with our church missionaries and my daughter and her husband and we still have some for us these were delicious and I hope you try them press like if you like this video and be sure and subscribe to my channel I'll see you next time goodbye [Music]", "CFgBbfU89fc": "[Music] is that good is it delicious [Music] ah hey everyone i hope they had a happy holidays i think we all definitely needed to find some ways to bring cheer into our lives towards the end of this year i know one of the things i always used to look forward to when i would be able to go visit home for the holidays my friend eric's mother anytime i'd visit home during school or even now throughout the years she'd always make me up a batch of what we call bolster bars which is peanut butter rice krispie treats that have a layer of chocolate on the top and she'd always send me home with those and then i'd enjoy those for quite a while but since i don't get to go home this year to visit uh i sent her a little message and just asked if she could tell me how she made them so that's what i did last night i made up what we're going to call the control version the standard rice crispy cheese with some jiffy peanut butter and carrot syrup and white sugar but since a lot of people these days do a lot of their shopping primarily only at trader joe's and you're not going to find these name brand items there i thought for the video purposes i see if i could make a variation of this treat using items found at trader joe's so we're going to try it with some almond butter i'm going to try using agave syrup instead of corn syrup since the agave is sort of a darker sweetener i thought maybe brown sugar would be good instead of white refined sugar and then some of these extra dark trader joe's chocolate chips and we're going to see how that comes out hopefully it tastes just as good as the original because these are my favorite treat so good okay so to get started we're gonna head over to the stove we're gonna start combining the ingredients i'm going to do a little split screen with the original recipe and the trader joe's recipe but it's basically the same thing you're just replacing one of the ingredients with the other okay by the way before we get started remember in last week's cheese ball video when i took the end of those green onions and i put them in a glass of water and i told you we'd be able to grow some new green onions from that well look at this hey not bad huh they're already starting to sprout now i'm just going to give them a little bit more and then we can put these in some soil and start growing some onions [Music] all right so we start out with half a cup of agave or a half a cup of the corn syrup [Music] next we add in a half a cup of brown sugar or a half a cup of sugar now we mix this up until they're kind of melted together and then once that happens we're going to add in our peanut butter [Music] okay now comes the time to add in one cup of peanut butter or almond butter all right now we're just going to mix that in until this is all mixed into one consistent sort of peanut buttery sugary paste now let that's all mixed nicely if you're wondering why i was making this in such a big pot because then we got to mix in our three cups of rice krispie treats or organic crisp ripes cereal okay now i'm gonna make sure we're just gonna mix this until all the crispy treats are covered these trader joe's ones have a really nice consistency i like the texture of them they're really puffy it's gonna make for an interesting textured bar i think [Music] all right now once that's all mixed together we're going to transfer into a baking [Music] pan [Music] press this down flat [Music] once you got that all flat into a nice flat layer [Music] all right now comes the good part where we add in our dark chocolate and spread these chocolate chips out evenly over the surface just get spread all over just make sure there's roughly an even distribution so you'll get an even melt we'll spread it after but this will just help once it's melted now we're going to just pop this under the broiler for just about a minute just until the chocolate melts and then once it's starting to melt we're gonna spread it out over the top [Music] [Music] all right just let that go for a quick minute now that chocolate is all melted and just spread it out evenly on top spread that chocolate around nice little like swirly pattern [Music] okay well now that we have a nice even layer chocolate on the top we're gonna put this in the fridge maybe for about two hours to let this chocolate cool down and harden up then we can take it back out and take it out here and cut it into some nice little treats all right so we'll check back in on that later a little later all right so it's been about an hour and a half we're gonna pull these out of the fridge and hopefully we have some delicious treats to try [Music] oh yeah look at that all right now we're just gonna pry this on here and cut it up there we go [Music] phew [Music] okay let's cut these guys up [Music] [Music] so that's the trader joe's version and that is the rice crispy version obviously the trader joe's one's a little bit darker from the dark brown sugar and the agave and the um almond butter as opposed to the peanut butter and corn syrup so let's see how these compare this time go lighter and try the peanut butter rice krispie that's still really good it's so good the peanut butter rice crispy one has just got a more airiness to it mmm i don't know they're both delicious definitely chewier they're both winners so if you're shopping at your regular name brand grocery store i obviously highly recommend making the rice krispies and peanut butter if you like that sort of dark molasses flavor and a nice really chewy bar i recommend going to trader joe's and getting these ingredients and making this one too maybe try making them both and see which one you like better hmm man these came out so good so i'd be curious to hear your guys thoughts on what you thought of this trader joe's alternate universe version of a recipe um if you guys know of any other sort of classic recipes that are made with name brand products and you'd like me to experiment trying and making an alternate version of that with items from trader joe's i think this could be an interesting series let me hear your thoughts on that and if you have any ideas of some things i could try drop me a message all right again i hope everybody had a happy holidays and is looking forward to a good new year let's hope 2021 has a lot of positive things in store for us uh i'm hoping to just keep making these videos for you guys and i hope that you're watching i hope you're liking and i hope you're subscribing please leave me some comments i'd love to hear feedback or if you guys have any ideas for things you'd like me to try i'm

making our soft and chewy granola bars heat your oven to 350 degrees line the bottom and sides of an 8 inch or 9 inch square pan with foil then use a lightly oiled paper towel to oil the foil cooking spray will work as well measure out about a 1/2 cup of whole elements then give them a child it can be rough add them to a small baking sheet then add two and a half cups of old-fashioned rolled oats spread them out in the pan then bake for about five minutes stir then bake another three to five minutes until they are lightly toasted transfer them to a large bowl grab a small saucepan combine a quarter cup of butter 1/3 cup of honey by the way by lightly oiling the measuring cup the honey will easily come out add 1/4 cup of lightly packed brown sugar some vanilla extract and a little salt place over medium heat and cook stirring occasionally until butter melts and the sugar completely dissolves pour the butter mixture into the bowl with toasted oats and almonds mix well then let cool about 5 minutes add 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips stir to combine the chocolate will most likely melt a little this is fine they turn into glue for the bars transfer everything to the lined pan then use a rubber spatula or you can use damp fingers to firmly press the mixture into the pan press hard here this way the bars will stay together once cooled and cut scatter another 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips over the pressed granola mixture and use a rubber spatula to gently press them into the top cover then refrigerate for 2 hours after 2 hours remove the block of granola mixture from the pan and carefully peel away the aluminum cut into 12 bars and enjoy you can store the bars in an airtight container for up to one week", "s9gBEul3RA4": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to crumbs and doilies and today as an extra little treat I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite ever treats which is rice krispie squares so I use some of these when we made the fridge cake the other day which loads have you made and they looked awesome so thanks so much for baking along with me and I thought actually these are so simple to make you just need like three ingredients and they're delicious you can pretend that they're breakfast because they've got cereal in them and so we're gonna start by getting our tin ready I put a little tin I've got a seven by seven because I like these to be quite kind of tall and chunky but if you haven't got one of these just go for any size you've got or a ceramic dish or anything will work but we just need to line it with a bit of greaseproof first so I've got some melted butter here and we're just gonna spread that around the whole of the tin okay and then we'll take our grease proof paper which cut to size and we'll gently lay it in the tin making sure that all the sides are covered so that we can get out of the tin nice and easily it's not going to stick to the tin ruin our lovely square rice krispies treats so that's all ready and we'll just pop that to one side for now and we'll get on with making the treat so it starts with some melted butter and I like to do this with burnt butter because I think it adds they can cut a little richness a little nutty taste in there as well but you can just use melted butter if you wish but we're gonna burn this today so I've got 60 grams of butter in my saucepan and we're gonna heat it over a medium heat stirring it all the time until it turns nice and golden [Music] so you want to keep stirring this because it is going to catch on the bottom of the pan and once you've got it to a lovely amber color you'll smell it as well it smells incredible we're going to take it off the heat and we're going to add a pinch of salt and now we're going to add 150 grams of marshmallows I've got little white ones and but whatever marshmallows you can get hold up will do perfectly we're gonna add them into the pan and because the pan and the butter are hot that's going to melt this down so you don't need to kind of worry about putting it back on the heat and once it's all melted it will be all kind of stringy and looking like something out of ghostbusters we're gonna grab our rice krispies and I've got 125 grams of those and we're gonna tip the marshmallows straight into the bowl [Music] okay so you want to mix those until it's all nice and even and you can leave it like this but I'm gonna add a few sprinkles so I've got about two tablespoons of lovely bright sprinkles you can use whatever sprinkles you like or anything else you can put chocolate chips in pretzels anything you like so they're gonna go in and I'm gonna add a few extra marshmallows because I quite like it when you get the little chunks of them in the little treats here and then we'll quickly stir those in you want to make sure not to over stir if you've got sprinkles or chocolate chips because they'll start to melt because obviously the marshmallow is still a little bit warm but once you think you've got it as even as you can I'm going to tip it into our tin so this is setting really quickly and all the time as soon as we've taken it off the heat so we need to smush this down and I find the best way to do that it's with an extra bit of greaseproof paper so that I can put that on top and I'm just going to push down with my hands getting it into all the corners and making it nice and level on top [Music] so when you've got it nice and smooth and level and it's looking like this we just need to let it set before we can use it and it's not gonna take very long maybe another 10 minutes so we'll be back then to cut it and eat it and ten minutes later it's out of the fridge it's out of the tin and it's looking awesome I love it so now it's time to cut it so I've got my nice sharp knife and a ruler because guys we want these to look perfect we want them to look Instagram perfect and you know let's face it we've all got a little extra time on our hands so we're going to start by measuring it I'm going to divide it by three because I like that kind of size so I'm going to go for two and a quarter inches square [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there it is it's finished it's probably the easiest quickest thing ever to make looks great it's all kind of boingy mmm and it tastes great too mmm quite chewy hmm and you can really taste that kind of burnt butter this brings an extra flavor through and a little bit of salt pulling those flavors out as well it's perfect and it's delicious it will keep for ages as you it won't keep for ages because every time you walk past it you're gonna eat it honestly but we'll be back soon with another recipe in the meantime head over to cupcake Gemma calm to suit have a look at our kind of merchants our baking kits which you guys are loving keep posting your photos on Instagram as well use hashtag cupcake Gemma so we can all see them and we'll see you soon in the meantime

"r8UwV9dgyks": "hi everybody this is Shauna with Lemmy's cake ma'am sir you over there trying to keep it a secret but I know why you clicked on this video you know why you clicked on this video you try to save some money awesome treats in this video I'm gonna teach you how to make your own Rice Krispies pops these are so easy to do by me once I'll show you the technique you're gonna want to be treat master at all your parties so first let's pour in our royal blue candy melts into our Bowl we have our vegetable shortening in order to thin out our chocolate gold sprinkles for the decoration silicone molds of king crowns [Music] in a silicone mold of letters and for both of those moles I'm going to include the link in the description part of where you can find those online for the gold detailing we're going to use Kate highlighter dust and gold yellow candy melts or white candy melts is fine [Music] popsicle sticks [Music] and if you're going to individually wrap your rice krispies treats you'll want to [Music] okay so let's go ahead and spoon in two spoons of the vegetable shortening into our chocolate and we'll put it in the microwave and melt on 30-second increments until our chocolate is all the way melted and smooth [Music] next we're going to take our rice krispies treats put those on the popsicle sticks and dip dip in our chocolate shake off that excess chocolate and then lay down on the parchment paper the rice krispies treats you can make yours yourself and cut out rectangles or you can buy the pillows rice krispies treats [Music] next we are going to make sure that our rice krispies treats are all the way dry and we're going to take some chocolate and put in a ziplock baggie or a piping bag take some scissors and cut off just a little bit of the ends and we are going to drizzle on diagonal chocolate lines onto the rice krispies treats and then we're going to sprinkle on our gold sprinkles now just make sure before you drizzle this chocolate on make sure that your rice krispies treats are all the way dry otherwise when you sprinkle on your sprinkles they're gonna stick to the whole entire rice krispies treat and you do not want that [Music] next we are going to take our food brush and we're going to brush the rest recipe treat so we're getting off the extra sprinkles [Music] next we're going to take our yellow candy melts or our white candy melts either one and we're going to put into a bowl and microwave that until our chocolate is all the way melted and then we're going to pour that into a ziplock baggie or a piping bag take some scissors snip off the end and then we are going to squirt and chocolate into the mold so it fills the crown all the way and then whatever letter you're going to be using I'm using a K this time and then once that's filled pop that in the refrigerator for a few minutes so I can get nice and cold there and then you see me popping it out and it is a perfect little chocolate curl [Music] next one I'm doing is taking a little bit of chocolate putting it at the bottom of the letters in the bottom of the crown and sticking it to the popsicle sticking it to the Rice Krispies pop that way the cup key that is there's so many things you can do once you invest in silicone molds I have so many of them the only thing about this part is that if you have a lot of these Rice Krispies pops you're gonna have to spend a lot of time filling in your letters and your crowns and then putting them in the refrigerator and going back and forth with this if you have a lot of them this I have actually three dozen of these to do so it did take me about three hours to complete these [Music] [Music] next I'm going to take my golden highlighter dust and as you have seen me do in previous videos I'm mixing either a little bit of lemon extract or a little bit of alcohol into the dust so it turns into a paint now just an FYI the alcohol does evaporate out so this is totally safe for kids if you use alcohol but like I said an alternative is lemon extract I told y'all it was gonna be easy peasy look at the gloriousness y'all look at the glorious small job the glory of malls alright now that you guys know how to make rice krispies pops I command you to go forth into the world and make beautiful glorious rice krispies pops", "YnMl3h1GNP0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] so when we cook down our

dutch chocolate it's got some heat to it and the arm homie [Music]", "Phhx2xz03KE": "I want to I too but it is with us today wedding sick of our stage what is yes you will need any chocolate of your choice and using era some rice krispies you're going to start off by putting all the chocolate into a microwave-safe bowl and putting it in the microwave for 1 minute and 30 seconds then after that the balls going to be pretty hot so be careful but then after that it's going to look like this it's still going to look like that but all you have to do is poke it a little and you'll see the sliminess coming off on to your fingers so it's melted just take a fork or spoon and just mix it all up into a chocolaty texture like this after that I'm just taking a handful of rice krispies cereal and just pouring it in with this poured in we're going to mix it until all the chocolate mixes into the rice krispies cereal it's all covered you take a ziplock bag with the rice krispies mix into the ziplock bag I'm just going to do it and I'll be right back perhaps take what's in the ziplock bag and like just lightly flatten it over so it's flat like that after that we're going to take it and just put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes 10 to 12 minutes no longer I just wrap it up like this just stick it down all together you", "6429YP5FhwE": "hi guys it's me Janie Jean and welcome to my kitchen today I'm giving you three easy tips to improve your crisp rice cereal treats tip number one Brown your butter it's a simple tip all you do is melt stick of butter down and you're going to cook it over medium heat until it's a toasty golden brown color it's rich its nutty it's that x-factor flavor tip number two never ever underestimate the power of a pinch of salt you just take a pinch

i do food and product reviews and i also do recipe reviews and basically whatever else i want to review but today i am reviewing rice krispie treat recipe my cousin sent me this recipe on facebook i watched the video i messaged her back i said i don't think it's real i think i should try it and she said i think you should too so that's what i'm going to do um i will try to link that video below because i'm watching it and it drives me crazy a lot of these videos this this video in particular since last week got 5.3 million views i don't know how many people believe it maybe this is gonna work i don't know i could be totally wrong but there was so many flaws in this video that it was driving me crazy and so i just have to find out for myself i was on going around tick tock too so you may have seen it on tik tok so i know you can make rice krispie treats um with peeps melting them down but the way she did it i don't i don't think it worked um but we're going to find out all you need our peeps rice krispies whatever brand i i wasn't gonna buy real rice krispies because i'm not sure this is gonna work at all and they taste the same and you need some butter all right let's get started let's get started okay the first problem i saw in the video is that she did not spray the pan if you work with marshmallow at all you know marshmallow's gonna stick so i'm only gonna spray half the pan because i don't want to try to clean the whole pan when this doesn't work so i'm gonna spray only half maybe maybe not well i got a broken can that i got at aldi aldi i am not happy with you right now all right all right new plan i'm just i'm just gonna butter half the pan i'm very disappointed in that spray aldi you let me down so now i'm just gonna line them with the peeps just take cereal any brand you'd like save yourself some money get the store brand there's no measuring here you just cover it on that's covered then you put more peeps on top i don't put as many on top so there you have it okay now you slice really thin slices of butter like four tablespoons and you just put it over the top [Music] cover it with foil it's going to go into a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes all right 350. oven might be dirty don't look all right 10 minutes all right it's been 10 minutes i'm gonna pull it out and see let's find out together i wouldn't burn myself okay all right so i'm gonna let it go a little bit longer because the ones underneath are not even gonna mix up these might i'm gonna go another maybe six minutes all right it's been another six minutes so i'm gonna take it out and see what we got looks pretty melty if you watch nothing else go to the end of the video and watch when she took it out of the oven she didn't stir it she cut it right away so much wrong with it that's this might work i don't know but not the way it was shown in the video like i said she did not start at all it's pretty and to be honest this side is not sticking i know there's a lot of butter in here anyway but i could probably use more rice krispies so if you can see all the marshmallow that is in there all right another thing i didn't like about the video did not tell how much so i'm just gonna add some and the original recipe for rice krispie treats calls for six cups but only three tablespoons of butter and it's sad that i know that recipe but i love rice krispie treats i never make them because i eat them all but i'm not a big big peeps fan so i'm not think i'll like these i'm gonna let it cool and then i will cut it all right so it's cooled off i'm kind of still a little warm but and it's just not staying together though it's ah usually if i make a rice krispie treat it would stay together i'm gonna let them cool completely and see if they stay together any better all right we're gonna try this again let me try cutting it much better much better i don't know i would recommend spraying the heck out of it because i think it's just going to be easier much better much better i'll let it sit probably a couple hours seem to be sweeter really don't taste much different they just taste sweeter you know i actually tried to peep while i was waiting for these to cool you didn't realize peeps really don't taste like anything have they changed over the years because i remember them tasting like something i'm really not getting anything i'm just getting the sugary part on the outside it worked which let me say i can admit when i'm wrong and i was wrong about this not working but hopefully i can show this video clip here i'm going to show you oh my gosh oh my gosh this is amazing i can't yet i want you to see my finished product oh that's it that's what drove me crazy is how she just pulls it out of the oven and then starts cutting it she didn't mix it up you have to mix it up oh and i had gone back and watched the video again and she said you had to put the butter on each of the peeps you couldn't put it on the rice krispies because if you did that it would burn in the oven the crispies would burn in the oven what no that did not happen i put it on the crispies it didn't burn so because of all those things in the video with her pulling it out of the oven and being ready to cut and all that that's what made me so skeptical so it does work um would i recommend it i would recommend if you want a little coloring in it either put some food coloring in it or get colored these aren't colored marshmallows but colored marshmallows um because peeps you're gonna spend you know a pack of eight peeps at um walmart or a dollar 25 and you can get a whole bag of marshmallows for that so i would get just get the colored marshmallows do taste sweeter but i you would never know they were peeps so it's not really worth the extra money i guess if you want the extra sugar go up go for it but or if you have leftover peeps i could see using it but going out to buy peeps just to make this i would say don't waste your money always question always there's just so many out there trying to go viral that they do different things to try to be funny or make it seem better than it is so always question these videos so if you ever see any recipe videos like on tick tock or instagram facebook whatever and you're skeptical um send them to me and i'll see if i can do them if you like the video hit that thumbs up and if you haven't

you think also you're going to save a lot of money here's how to make them in a large bowl add old-fashioned or five and oats whole wheat flour unsweetened coconut salt chocolate chips you can use regular or mini and brown sugar whisk it up it's thoroughly combined then you need an oval for vegetable oil in that same cut that you have the canola or vegetable oils add your honey and you'll see that the honey is just going to slide right out send a little bit of vanilla extract with the liquid ingredients together and pour them into the oat mixture now this is a really important time make sure that you use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to thoroughly combine and coat the oats this is the trick to making perfect rinoa bars onto a Silpat or parchment lined baking machine you're going to pour the oat mixture spread it using a spatula or a bench scraper until it's about a half an inch to an inch thick you want it to be in a perfect rectangle they could 325 degrees for about 40 minutes or so just starting to get golden and another curious trick here let it cool completely before you cut it into bars when it's finished you're going to have granola bars that are so crispy and

bit different you troops an amazing place because our weight connected to people and cultures from all over the world and lots of different ways of doing things and one of the videos I watched recently which I thought was really interesting and I put a link to it in the information below was how to make rice krispies and in particular the video I was watching was a thing of baseness unlike India in like an auroral setting and they're making it the natural way so they weren't making it in a big factory and to do that they had their the rice and they sort of washed the rice and then they drive it out and they're putting some really boiling sand and it's all popped up it like popcorn I thought that's interesting well if I could do something like that now I don't have the sand I don't have the same road equipment they they use and I'm only barely understanding how it actually works but I'm gonna try and do a version of that but instead of using hot Sun because I don't have any hot sand I'm gonna use oil and I've got some plain whole-grain rice so I'm gonna have a goal to see if I can make Rice Krispies myself or home now not quite know how to do it in the Kellogg's Factory I'm gonna make some myself let's see what comes out like let's get started [Music] all right so as far as I can understand this is a procedure I think you do I'm not entirely sure why every stage is in there I'm just gonna copy what I've seen them do and I will see what kind of results we get so first thing that's that they seem to do and this is me watching them in a rural settings although I can't see clearly and up there is no description but I think first thing I do is they add water to the rice not much and then they spend their time mixing it through not entirely sure why my guess you can work it out too much food tech science point of view is that mixing the water a little bit of water gets in a little bit of water gets inside the Etra grain itself and somebody must soften or pretty do something so when it goes into the hot environment maybe the the sudden evaporation of the water on the inside makes it swell up and burst at all I'm not entirely sure a lot to this thing I thought maybe this agent necessary but and the balls clear - I saw them do as possible but add a little water and it's been about two or three minutes mixing all the way through don't know why I'm gonna do that myself so happens okay so mix it round for about two or three minutes Carl tell exactly where the receptors actually made its I think some of those starches time to be released I don't have the education or the water I'm nine tiny Shore what the station does maybe like to experiment to do with or without but for now I'm gonna try and copy what I think I saw them doing as best as possible and let's see what cameras also we get we get so nice thing I saw them do it which is interesting it's a bit of spent all the time because in a water or in this mixing round they spent about five minutes slowly drying back out again so so let's go over to the hop and did a drying out stage so well done I just dropped in the rice and on the video which I was watching they seemed to after live for the walk moisture in they seemed to have dried out the rice so I'm gonna try and do now I'm gonna try and dry it out on the stove like I said I'm not quite sure the set but with steaks does but I'm not quite sure if I'm gonna get rice crispies first time I'm doing it but we'll see so I'm gonna go ahead and dry these out for a good five minutes and then return back to see what we get okay I've been solved dry them out for about five minutes I think they're dry I think there's a street they're supposed to be dry so let's stop that now so far we've sort of half soaked or mixed in a few stable spoons of water into our rice grains and then we drown in my count again and I sure is that good because that's made the rice grains seem a little softer seem a little more translucent maybe still something the next days now well that's watching a video what they did they actually dropped they actually put the rice into hot Sun so they had sand unlike a a bowl thing that's heated with cold and soon as the Sun went in they mix the sand all around so he went all around the rice and they started to just pop up like popcorn Ike rice krispies and then they sift it out the sand and put the rice crisps as one sigh and the sand back in the heat now we don't have to sand maybe I'll try and I'll get some sand and clean it and try it another time so instead of using Sun I'm going to use oil because also seen a technique done using oil not quite as it's healthy because obviously we're using salt frying in a way but at least let's see by way of experiment if we get a similar kind of results and pouring some oil the cool thing about this is that I've never done this before so cool what I'm gonna get and I'm still thinking and I mean you might think well if a kid doesn't come out well I'm even gonna show you my aunt my failed attempt but maybe I will maybe once you see this may be running the seat because they had to worked we shall see anyway I'm gonna heat up the oil and then I drop one rice gradient to see what happens and if that appears to be a success they're not up a few more and then we'll see happens now fish them out with this let's on a green it must come out I've got a call popcorn come on I call rice krispies be quiet or [Music] working out yes nope this doesn't works as far as I'm concerned so that's why I cook more great temperature a little bit higher and then what do I do because it's not that's not work for not gonna dump all the grass in it I'm going to cook the rice then try it again so what comes out okay so I'll cook the rice now and it's just actually dry out a little bit on this sort of sieve and to make it dry out further I'm gonna put this in the oven just so it gets really really dry vibrates all the water out next step drop in the oil let's the wrappers let's see if we end up at some pilot process with anything looks like rice krispies some pops of the oven just to kind of dry this out a little bit maybe for half an hour an hour or so then return okay so our rice is out of the oven it's been kind of half cooked and then fully dried out dip into here all right okay oh we do now is drop it into it heat up our oil drop it in see what happens all right I've preheated it the oil is pretty hot and I'm throwing some rice that's just so happens whoa here we go this kind of works I'm gonna throw it all in [Applause] hit snap crackle crackle and pop in there we go pour it off some puffed rice there you go it's worked a little bit of a time-consuming process but I'm sure if you've ever had to can we find that now depending what kind of rice you use will depend on how fat it fluffed up this is just whole-grain rice maybe I'll try it give me different types of rice but that's not a bad result though we have it how to make rice crispies I think that's been a decently successful experiment I think looking at better even better results if we use the same kind of rice that is actually using rice krispies and but for this particular whole grain variety I think we can at least see that it has popped up it's crispy okay quite nice I think we'll call that success we do now put in the container and we've got a nice taste

Kitchen and I want to make something today that we would never make on good eats because it would depend upon on a brand name cereal and we can't use brand names so we are going to make rice Creek Rice Krispies my quarantine mask rice krispies treats come on over we're gonna make them let's do it here's the simple truth ladies and gentlemen if you're gonna make rice krispies treats you better be using rice krispies not puffed rice cereal which is what you have to say on TV because after all this is a brand name and here's another thing you're gonna need marshmallows are you better off making your own marshmallows sure but are we gonna do that right now no but we might be able to to find some made ones some bad ones and I would only go with jet pop I have two 10 ounce bags of the aforementioned jet pod can I do this with one yes but why would you send one bag of marshmallows if you could send to the one little switch up here butter you're gonna need a stick of butter and this is where I'm gonna get a little gourmet on you this I'll actually needed that this is a brand name butter and it's a darn good one this is a Kerrygold it's a high fat butter it is high butter fat it is tasty stuff and it is going to make all the difference in the world to this recipe more on this later because we've got to do some stuff to this I'm also gonna add salt because kosher salt there you go so the parts list is you know the stuff that you know from childhood you might notice that I have a wok here and the reason I have a wok here is because I'm going to toast all of this cereal and I usually do that with a slightly smaller box so odds are this is gonna make a terrible mess that no one's gonna clean up because there's nobody here and I'm not going to do it so let's come on over and put this on the heat I'm gonna do this over medium-high heat at first my goal here is to just toast the cereal making it just a little bit darker a little darker brown that is gonna bring out more of the the ricey flavor and believe it or not that is going to definitely translate into the the final dish it's gonna take a few minutes I'm getting 99% of it back in the walk I think it's pretty good turn down the heat just a little I smell I smell burning I can't tell if it's snap or crackle but one of them's we're good to go so I'm gonna remove this to a bowl because we need the wok or other business we are going to brown the butter we're actually going to cook it until it's sugars and milk proteins Brown a bit that is going to bring a considerable amount of flavor to the party you could do this with regular we'll call it everyday butter instead of the really good stuff but I do think that for a dessert like this I mean heck of you can eat this many calories make it good you know you do not have to do this in a wok you could do this in and separately in a saucepan you could do it in just anything almost I've actually browned butter in a tin can one time guys it was technically aluminum but since I've got to use the wok anyway I'm gonna go with this now if you wanted to toast your rice but you didn't have the wok is use the biggest pot you got with the widest bottle you won't be able to do the tossing part but that's okay [Music] if you want to check for the color if your if you're using a dark pan like a wok you'll have to use something where you can get a look at it I'm gonna let that Brown just a little bit more but not too much because I don't want to burn it that's all right it's about all I want out of that I'm gonna add a little bit of salt that might film up a little don't worry about it all right let's turn the heat down just a bit marshmellows now at this point you're probably gonna want to get a rubber spatula cuz things are about to get really really sticky and just stir until those marshmallows break down remember they're mostly air but they are gonna get really gooey don't get this on your hands so you'll have to chop them off that's oddly satisfying there you go I'm gonna let this just melt down meantime I'm gonna get my container ready now most of you have probably made rice krispies treats in a pan but when I was a kid I wanted to eat these things without my mother knowing that I was eating them so when I made them and I learned how in Boy Scouts I actually just learned to spray a little cooking spray into the original cereal bag we're going to actually put the mixture back in here and let it set that way you can just walk around looking like you're eating cereal but you're actually that's right mom that's what I was doing that whole time mmm basically we've got brown butter marshmallow fluff I feel like Willy Wonka keep the heat on at this point where the marshmallows will set too soon now just stir and be patient it's gonna take a few minutes this is kind of people's minds now we got to move fast ordinarily like I said into a pan and that's perfectly fine if that's how you want to do things but not me trust me there'll be plenty of leftover because this is gonna more and fill this box I really should have put a glob on one because this isn't terribly sanitary and - I'm burning just like snap and crackle but you know what I'm here by myself except for camera guy he doesn't mind I'll we'll just let this cool down for a few minutes ha ha ha ha an innocent box of rice krispies ha ha so here we have it huh completely hidden inside an innocent box of unsweetened cereal so that when my mom yells at me no I'm just eating cereal there's not even any sugar in here", "AigA-iX9MHg": "hello everyone and welcome back to fun ideas do you have a party and you don't know what snacks you can put uh for your friends well you're in luck today because guess what we're going to do we are going to do some cereal bars and all you're going to need is actually some marshmallows and some cereal so i'm going to use fruity peppers i'm going to use a fruity purple cereal and i am also going to use a pack of marshmallows sticks is optional sticks if you wanted for example squares without sticks you can do that but sticks are optional if you want to add them on a stick and i'm also going to use 65 grams of butter so grab your cereal and your marshmallows and let's get started okay everyone so i've put it here my butter and i've melted it so put your butter till it all melts melts on medium heat so after we do this we're going to add our pack of marshmallows i'm gonna add all of it till it's also mixed so i've also saved some marshmallows here for later i'm gonna tell you later why um so i'm gonna come back after these marshmallows melts on medium heat okay so the marshmallow has pretty much melted and now i'm going to add my six cups of cereal i'm using fruity peppers because i wanted mine to be colorful so i'm gonna slowly add that in i don't want to take anything out add them all in and now i'm gonna mix this up i'm gonna mix this and i'm gonna come back when i'm done okay guys so i've mixed it all now correct i told you that i saved some marshmallows i'm gonna add them now in and the reason why i'm adding these marshmallows is this is actually optional because i want the marshmallows to look like chunks when you when you we when you eat it so the marshmallows here that we added will not melt and will and when you cut it into small pieces it the marshmallow the marshmallow will look like it's uh like it's chunks which gives us a nice effect and taste so that's optional if you want to add the marshmallows so i've mixed now everything and it's time to pour it in here now i've added some oil here so um i've greased it with oil and now i'm going to add my mixture i'm gonna slowly add it let me first take here okay and i'm gonna slowly add this in here it's kind of heavy i'm gonna come back when i'm done okay so as you see i had some little help to pour this in um now i am going to take some baking sheet and i'm going to take away my spatula for a minute i'm going to take my baking sheet add it in and press it slowly so it can turn flat from the top so i'm going to keep doing this until it's all it's till it's all in the pan nicely and so as you see it's getting squished like this so it can be neat so after i'm done um we have to leave it for 10 minutes so i'll come back okay everyone so we're done and we cut it the two pieces now uh when we took it out make sure you use um when you're using when you're uh putting in the mixture and make sure you use something that is like long so it can be thick like this it has more um so after we finished i actually cut them to squares and make sure you add oil um so it takes so it goes out easily so i've cut it each one and i've decorated and meanwhile they were resting i actually decorated these the sticks so it's actually pretty easy to do just take your stick and slowly put it here so i used this cereal because now they look colorful okay so now i'm going to put them for example on this trail so for example when you're putting them at the party or something see you can also put this as you see they're very nice to do you can also with you can also add a drizzle of white chocolate like also you see i put these with sticks these are without and they also have a drizzle of white chocolate i'll try to add white chocolate now here so let me just flatten here and add some chocolate on top just like this and you can add them white chocolate with each one like what i did you can add each a drizzle of white chocolate as you want or you can keep them just regular they're very easy to make at home and as i told you before i added marshmallows so there will be i saved some marshmallows so there will be some chunks of marshmallow which let me see if i can spot one somewhere as you see there's some marshmallow bits because i wanted to add these marshmallow chunks so it looks like it has much marshmallow inside so i'll now try one i choose this one and look when i open it wow that's very stretchy i want to try to eat it now i'm gonna keep um this sorry my mouth is full but this is very good [Music] i want to share these with my family after the video so these are how to make the cereal bars very easy to do very tasty i need some marshmallows and some cereal i hope you enjoyed the video bye you", "arQmox_Ftzw": "this is a video tutorial on how to make Golden Grahams s'mores

enjoy", "xvfEarJHFi4": "caimans welcome back to my channel and your girl be back with another video today I'm gonna be sharing with you guys how I do the Box chocolate-covered rice krispies this video has been requested ever since I posted the old baby video because of the rice krispies see you guys today it's finally the day where I show you how to make those famous bar chocolate cone rice krispies so yeah let's get started okay guys so before anything else I want to say that I just finished using this mold before it so when you guys because I forgot to show it to you before I used it I got this mold on Amazon and it came in a three pack and it was like ten dollars I think I'm not even sure but I'll link it down below on the description box for you guys so what that being said so the way I did the holes on the mold is super easy you guys all I did was get a regular cake pop stick and I stuck it in the middle of the mold I didn't check for size I didn't measure nothing all I did is just stick it until it went to the other side and that's how I did it exactly like that that's the way I do my chocolate over rice krispies this is the way that I feel it's easier for me so yeah [Music] okay so let's make some I'm gonna be using regular paper straws I'm gonna go ahead and use the rice krispies and all I'm gonna do is just stick the paper straw in the middle of the rice krispies as far as the chocolate I get a lot of questions about the chocolate my favorite one is the almond bark I get it at Walmart and it's the Walmart brand you guys it's easy to work with the candy melts from Wilton especially the white one you guys is so hard to work with and this time I use avocado oil but it's always a mission to use the white water in candy melts the only reason I'm using water candy melts here is because warmer was all out of almond bark okay so this is gonna depend on you I use sometimes I you to two tables two teaspoon tablespoons I don't know what this spoon is counters at the tablespoon a teaspoon I don't know but I use two of them or one it depends how thick you want the chocolate to be on the front of your rice krispies so you see me putting the scoops or table teaspoons of chocolate and all I'm gonna do is just spread it around so that way I get all the corners honestly I'd rather just tap tap tap the mold then use the spoon because I feel like a spoon is a lot Messier Messier so I love to tap tap tap and it's a lot easier for everything to get into the corners once I'm done doing that I put it in the freezer for about five to eight minutes until the chocolate is hardened and I'm gonna put in the rice krispies straw in first and I just flatten the rice krispies to the size that I need it so that way I can still put some more chocolate on top of it [Music] so after I feel like all the Rice Krispies are in place now I'm gonna go ahead and pour the rest of the chocolate so all I do is just pour the corners first and then I cover the top because it's easier to cover the top but at the site once I'm done with the chocolate i'ma go ahead and pull apart pull apart the side of the mold so that way all of the chocolate gets really in there and I just tapped just to make sure that there's no more air bubbles and there is no chocolate missing oh my god you guys just so hard to explain I'm so dumb at explaining things you guys it's just super hard for me right now [Music] once again when I'm them I put it back in the freezer for about five to eight minutes once they are ready I pull from the sides first so that way it's easier for me to just pull up when they are not stuck to the side okay what I'm trying to say is poop on the sides and then pull up from the middle make sure your straw doesn't Bend oh my god this is so hard to explain but here's the guys coming back to the straw sometimes it happens you guys the straws may ban because there's too much chocolate and because not other straws are super very strong so this is the way they look once you pull them out of the mold you guys don't care about how the back looks because nobody cares about that everybody just cares about the front side of the rice krispies so it looks so cute you guys I love the finished look all the time and I just wanted to show you guys how they look once you decorate them oh my god I feel they look so pretty and I don't know I just love this look way better than the regular rice krispies well you guys that was it for the video I really hope you guys enjoy I really hope I answer all of your guys's questions in that video if not please

hope you're all doing well today so I wanted to share a quick really easy really delicious double chocolate rice krispies treat recipe with you guys today I am making this for Jordan's family who are in Hawaii right now and his brother actually mentioned that he loves rice krispies treats this is one of my favorite dessert recipes because it is so easy and it's so delicious I have posted this on my Instagram and it looks beautiful another good thing about this recipe is since the rice krispies treats are normally stored at room temperature you don't have to worry about keeping it cold when you ship it so it's a great dessert and gift to send to someone if you want to know the recipe and you want to know how I make these rice krispies treats just stay tuned so all you'll need is a bag of marshmallows 1 or 2 bags of rice krispies cereal depending how firm you want your rice krispies treats I actually prefer the chocolate kind because they're so good I also have a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips you can also use dark chocolate and a bag of white chocolate chips as well because those are my favorites you will also need a tablespoon of butter and I actually like to add in about a half a tablespoon of coconut oil as well to give it a little bit more richness then dissipate just salt and those are pretty much all the ingredients you'll need for these rice krispies treats in addition to the ingredients I prefer to use a cookie sheet lined with a nonstick silicone mat or some parchment or wax paper it's prevent sticking I find that this makes it a lot easier to handle the rice krispies treats when they've hardened and you're ready to cut them up alright so let's get started I'm going to add the coconut oil and the butter into a large nonstick skillet over low heat and let that melt fully then I'm going to add the bag of marshmallows this is a 1-pound bag which is about 6 cups then stir that into the marshmallows are melted remember this is still on low heat and patience is a virtue this is optional but I like to add about 1/2 a cup of the white chocolate morsels to my marshmallows I think it adds a really nice flavor this is also where you would add your pinch of salt as well and now for the star of the show the Rice Krispies I actually ended up adding the entire bag which is about seven cups in the past I used a different brand which has larger kernels I didn't have to use as much however with this particular brand it came out that gooier which I love but if you prefer it to be firmer than just add some more Rice Krispies and now my favorite part the chocolate so I am adding about 1/2 cup each of these semi-sweet chocolate and the white chocolate morsels and then just giving it a quick stir to combine it alright so now I'm going to take that off the heat and then pour it onto my lined baking sheet making sure I get all of that goodness stuck on the bottom of the pan of course I'm going to add more chocolate because chocolate is life and this is so good and now these semi-sweet chocolate I'm just trying to layer this in so that you're getting bursts of white and some iced wheat chocolate with every bite then I'm gonna use my spatula to flatten out my rice krispies mixture into a semi compact XI that way I can create individual size bars with them and just in case you didn't think that was enough chocolate we're gonna add just a little bit more of both this on my sweet and the white chocolate and then pack them all down so that they do not fall off when you try to eat them so that is pretty much it and then you kind of just let these cool once it's cool you can cut it into like little squares and package it up that way so I'm gonna let this cool and then I'll be back to show you how I cut it alright so I left the rice krispies treats out so you kind of just cool down a little bit well I went to the gym and so now that is pretty much harden up a little bit it's still soft and gooey which is what I love this is like perfect that's another reason why I like laying it out on a tray like this and just flattening it out versus like trying to stuff it into a pan because that way it doesn't compress as much and get too hard so now that I have that I'm gonna go ahead and just grab a silicone pad and I'm just gonna flip back onto my cutting board I'm just gonna cut this into individual size about a two inch by two inch square piece or you can do like rectangular pieces of you want and obviously there's no right or wrong it's going to taste delicious no matter what shape they're in so there you go you have that shape oh my goodness it smells so good it is going to be so hard not to be tempted to eat these there you have it all done look how amazing this looks ah kind of are really really really hard not to get it maybe I'll allow myself enjoy them to have half of the piece and then we're going to ship the rest of it to his family in Hawaii [Music] [Music] store this I like to put them in a gallon size it's a block bags and then place a piece of parchment paper in between each layer so they don't stick together I found that this to be the best solution and it keeps them really moist and [Music] am i it that is ready to go and then I have this hot and cold bag that I got from the grocery store and with three or four dollars and it pretty much just keeps food at a certain temperature this is fine at room temperature but I don't want it to get super hot either so I got this just it kind of have it be insulated a little bit this just slides right inside like so and seal it up a box here I have some of these bubble wrappers also just to kind of make sure that it doesn't get damaged on the way going to tape it pits off a shipping label put it on there and then send it off to Hawaii I am super excited for Jordan's family to get this double chocolate rice krispies treat and I hope they enjoy it I hope you guys are watching the video also let me know your thoughts and opinions in the

should say", "dnVccuBSHMY": "hi guys and welcome back so today I'm doing a BuzzFeed tasty recreation of the crispy rice cereal chocolate cheesecake let's begin so just before we get into today's video I wants to say a massive thank you for stopping by don't forget to Like comment and subscribe click in the notification bell then you'll be notified whenever I upload to start you'll want to prepare your tin I line the base of my turn using some greaseproof paper but you could also use cling film if that's where you've got available so the next stage is to whip up your cream you will then want to whisk your cream until it gets to the stiff peak stage being careful not to over whisker any point once you've got it whipped you can then put it in the fridge until you need it later on [Music] so next is the stage where you melt the chocolate and cream together to make au sort of ganache they recommend pouring the cream over the chocolate and microwaving for 30 seconds at a time this was after 30 seconds and then another 30 seconds it was done so don't overheat it at this stage so into a medium-sized saucepan you'll want to add in your butter and put this over a medium-high heat until it's melted then take it off the heat and add in all of your mini marshmallows I opted for the white variety but feel free to use what you want put this back on the heat and mix it until it's become melted and smooth you can then add this to your rice cereal or rice krispies whichever you want to call it and then add in the marshmallow mixture into the rice cereal and just fold it in until it's all coated [Music] this stage doesn't take too long but make sure it's all fully coated and mixed through next you'll want to transfer that mixture into your ten inch tin and get as much of it in there as possible you will next want to push this cereal down and around side so you've built a wall and a base do this using a greased cook measurement I recommend having some butter or some oil there not a lot you just need a bit to coat the base and it'll help it move around so much easier this doesn't take too long but if you want it to look more perfect than you might want to spend a bit more time trying to get it as level as possible so into a medium sized bowl you'll want to add your soft cheese your granulated sugar and your vanilla and whisk these all together using a hand whisk or an electric whisk until it to come together and it smoothly all the ingredients should be fully incorporated you will then want to add in all of the chocolate mixture you made earlier on it should be cooled down by now and you'll just want to whisk this in until it's in fully incorporated you will notice that the mixture will go from being quite a dark brown and white to a medium to dark brown color scrape down sides in the bottom of your bowl and then add in the whipped cream and just fold this in using a spatula at this stage the mixture is already pretty thick and won't take very long in the fridge to set up you can then transfer your chocolate cheesecake mixture into your rice krispies Bowl get as much as that mixture in there as possible and then you want to level it out as best as you can I find using the spatula at first works well but then I like to use my small offset spatula to get as smooth as possible on top but don't worry if you're not looking for something super super smooth feel free to use the back of a spoon or your spatula you can then pipe on the whipped cream that we prepared earlier on one thing to note is that the amount that tasty recommended leaving aside wasn't enough and I actually had to whip up more at this point right here you can then add the chocolate on top I didn't have enough in this batch but then I just added some grated on top and it looked alright so don't worry about it too much he actually adds a bit of texture on top of the cheesecake which works really well you can set it in the fridge or you can remove it from the tin and plate up as you wish so I removed the tin from the sides and the base and then I also removed the greaseproof paper ad there previously and then cut into it cutting a slice out the Cheesecake itself was easy to cut into but when it came to cutting through the base I thought I had but then I realized I hadn't so you had to press and light ain't quite firm but it does make for an unusual twist on a traditional cheesecake which has a buttery biscuit base but I think I would stick with the more traditional biscuit base rather than a Rice Krispies one here is what it looks like once it's done so here is the final result and what it looks like when sighs we made it I think it looks somewhat like the tasty version but I press down too much on the base and apart from that it turned out well would I recommend making it yeah if you want to try something know a bit different the rice krispies Bowl does work a treat with it actually it's quite nice so yeah if you're looking for something different definitely try this and on that note thank you for watching if you've enjoyed don't forget to Like comment and subscribe for more from me I'll be back next week with another video any video

guys", "DadiLIIWtSA": "if you like granola bars you can always eat the ones you buy in the store if you like chewing on particle board or you can make my easy healthy chewy crunchy granola bars and the best thing is you can customize them with all your favorite crunchy chewy things like I do mine the first thing is you have to preheat the oven at 325 degrees which I've done you prepare a nine by nine inch square pan and I I line it with parchment paper so here's how I do it I cut two strips of about nine inch wide parchment paper and you're gonna line that crosswise but here's the thing I put books on these overnight to straighten them out and they still curls but anyway so you put one sheet across like this and you put the other sheet the other way and you keep these little long edges so you can have sort of handles to pick them up when they're done so tin foil did not work for me parchment paper works the best so there it's lined up you can kind of crease a little bit in place and then you can grease it with a spray that spray stuff I don't like it because I don't like the smell so I just used my little mixture of canola oil and butter and I just reached the pan this is probably the hardest part of the recipe is just preparing the pan otherwise everything is really really super easy so you just kind of grease it all around like that and that's good to go so I'll set the pan aside okay now here's the recipe you get a big bowl and we're gonna start with two and a half cups of oatmeal this is regular oats it's not the instant ones just regular ones from the store and you don't have to measure this super exactly like you're baking a cake so just about two and a half cups of these regular oats for a nice fiber then we're going to have a quarter cup of sweetened flaked coconut and when you add the coconut kind of loosen it with your fingers because you get these little clumps of coconut and you don't want that so kind of loosen it up really well when you add the coconut and then we're gonna add two tablespoons of brown sugar and I did this originally with a quarter cup of brown sugar but to me they were too sweet but you can use a little bit more but there's one and two tablespoons of brown sugar now here's the fun part you set this aside and you're going to add your extras this is how you can customize your own this is what I use right here I prepared my extras now here we have we have some toasted walnuts we have toasted pecans we have toasted almonds we have dried cherries which I love and we have these little mini chocolate chips but there's other so much other stuff you can add if you want to or use instead of any of these you can add raisins chopped figs chopped prunes dried blueberries dried cranberries sunflower seeds peanuts pumpkin seeds anything you want even big chocolate chips dentist loves the big chocolate chips so anyway it's about 1 cup whatever your dry crunchy ingredients are it's about 1 cup so I think I've got 1 cup here we'll see how well I measured looks like just about that's close enough so we're gonna put all this into the dry ingredients and before you add the liquids you're going to stir this up and separate the coconut and all that stuff stir it up just a little bit and now we're going to add three other ingredients this is the liquids basically you're going to take a quarter cup or a third of a cup sort a third of a cup of canola oil okay now when you measure oil of course it's good to look at it at a good eye level and that's about a third of a cup and you add a third of a cup of honey and this is kind of the glue that holds it all together so 1/3 cup huh well it takes a while but it will come out you can go the bathroom and come back if you want or you can go eat a granola bar and come back or you can just what wait a minute maybe you can do it this way what is this a mistake ok have to watch your thing up to 2/3 of a cup maybe that's the better way to do it okay that's two thirds of a cup you can see it I'd I level you need one teaspoon of vanilla extract I use this good stuff I love this vanilla no artificial flavoring okay and that's it that's all the the wet ingredients now you combine it all and that's the whole recipe so kind of mix this up a little bit by putting the oil in here first it helps to keep that honey from sticking to the bottom too much so you put it in here combined it really well and make sure you use a big enough bowl because you want to have to kind of go up the sides a little bit so you'll feel it it almost gets kind of heavier as you stir it but that's good but stir it really well because you have to distribute especially that honey so that's the stuff that's going to hold it all together okay so it's all stirred up now into the prepared pan okay I have to do it so you can see it these round these spatulas are so great for clearing out bowls and stuff these soft silicon spatulas now you press it down into the pan but you have to really press it down into the pan so it's kind of a messy job so I like to use a latex glove but you can do it with your bare hand and you press down really really well if you don't think this is important I'm telling you got to press it really hard if you don't think it's important talk to the hand okay because I'm telling you you have to do this so you press down all over get into the corners turn it keep pressing I've even done this with them like at the bottom of a glass that's kind of flat or like a measuring cup that's flat you can be creative if you want anything that's kind of flat but if you press hard enough use your whole palm of your hand press really hard all the way around and that's it don't talk to this hand now it's ready for the oven it's been preheated to 325 you put it in the oven for 30 minutes and after 30 minutes you take it out okay after 30 minutes you take it out of the oven and put it on a cooling rack and here's the thing you have to cool it in the pan don't try to cut it until it completely cools that's my little secret and this is important if you don't think it's important to cool in the pan talk to the hand okay this is how they're gonna come out of the pan they're nice and cool now the paper will come off because you prepped it really well see it feel see how nice and sticky and shiny it is on the bottom now you get a good sharp knife a big knife and you cut it into bars I usually cut it down the middle first like this halfway down and then I cut it into bars and you know remember you're cutting through your nuts and dried cherries and all kinds of stuff I cut it into about seven bars like this one two three four okay six bars six or seven bars whatever size you think sometimes you can do them in squares also so that's it here's your delicious healthy crunchy crispy Carolla bars you can eat these or you can chew on particle board it's up to you", "ifzPt6ZYwjk": "[Music] look beyond to the future [Music] [Applause]

Hey Cookaholics Chef Kendra here and today i'm gonna show you that's\nright you how to make no baked oatmeal bars these are my go-to bars when I'm in\na hurry and running out the door or just a\nsatisfying afternoon snack there's no baking but there is a little\ncookie but that's no big deal because why we're here right\nthis recipe makes six bars comes together quickly we're going to be using\ninstant oatmeal butter peanut butter semi-sweet chocolate chips on this oh\nyeah and some brown sugar we're gonna need a low pan some foil if you're\nsewing client you can toss some raisins in there alright there's you and I make\nit happen okay we're gonna start out by getting some butter in our medium sized\npot and we're gonna add our brown sugar to this we're gonna grab our trusty\nspatula and stir this all around now one do here is melt the butter and dissolve\nthe sugar into the butter and it should start to come up just to a slight boil\nbut the most important thing is getting the sugar dissolved next thing we're gonna do guys is to get\nour vanilla extract in here and our sea salt you don't have to use sea salt you\ncan just use table salt that's all good and we're gonna add our instant oatmeal\nwe're gonna stir this up and we're going to get all the oatmeal incorporate it\ninto the butter and the brown sugar and then we're gonna let it cook while we\nkind of stir it up for about four minutes once it's done it's gonna look\nlike this and we got some foil in a loaf pan we split that oatmeal mixture in\nhalf and we sprayed our aluminum foil with a light coat of best of all up now\nwe're gonna get half our oatmeal mixture in the pan and flatten it out with a\nspoon the next thing we're going to do is get\nour semi-sweet chocolate chips and our peanut butter I'm gonna mix them\ntogether a little bit into the microwave and we're going to melt the peanut\nbutter and the Chocolate together we're gonna let it go for 30 seconds stir it\nup until it's nice and smooth you might have to put it back in the microwave for\na little bit then and we're gonna take some of the chocolate out and I'm gonna\ntake a little taste and the rest of the chocolate and peanut butter mixture goes\nover the top of that first layer of oatmeal mixture just drizzle that\nchocolate and peanut butter on now how can that possibly be bad this is\ndelicious peanut butter chocolate melted together is delicious now we're gonna\nget the other half of that oatmeal mixture on top\nflatten it now here we have a plastic zip-top bag that we cut a little snip\noff of I'm gonna take that chocolate that we saved and we're gonna get it in\nthere and we're going to drizzle it over the oatmeal bars now you can do this in\nany pattern you want I didn't do anything I just went just made up a\nlittle pattern look at that chocolate go down what I\nlike about these bars is they are super easy you don't have to heat up the\nkitchen to do it I have to jack up the heat on the oven so then we cover it in\nsome plastic wrap and we put it in the frigerator and we're gonna let it chill\nin the refrigerator for four hours to set up this is what I call a brick we\nhave our brick here and I pull it out and it comes up pretty easy we sprayed\nit now I'm just cutting it into six portions I cut it down the center and\nthen basically I bought the rest of it now if you want to be OCD about it you\ncan cut off a little bit either side of the edge to get straight edges I have the bar here and I'm gonna give\nit a little taste now here's what it looks like in the front to the side I'm\njust gonna give it a little taste right now you guys it's chewy but not too chewy\na hosts it holds itself together well where it just doesn't break all the part\nwhen you bite it now it's not overly sweet you can taste that hint of peanut\nbutter but it's not overwhelmed with peanut butter you can taste that nice\nchocolate yeah this is good only like this I do eat them often it's\nnot like the first time I've ever tasted it but I love these in the morning and\nit has a lot of holding power it keeps you full for quite some time\nalright I'm finish this bar", "3reg6nPfJ-0": "cereal time cereal time see real time my box rice krispies treats some can a crispy cereal day what's up sir today we're going to talk about rice krispies treats cereal and yes I know I've already done a video about this cereal in fact you should go watch that original video if you haven't watched it yet the reason I'm covering this cereal again is because Kellogg's has done the unthinkable and gone and changed the recipe of this beloved classic to make it a much more inferior cereal it's almost like Kellogg's research and development team is like hmm what do cereal heads really want let's do the opposite of that and see how angry we can make them so for those of you who are too lazy to go back and watch that old rice krispies treats video I did let me breeze through the past before getting back to this current abomination rice krispies treats cereal was originally released back in 1993 this was the first box for the cereal you can see from the new label here on the box and I love this box it's a cool color and you have the embossed treats and little clusters here on the box here's one of the first commercials for rice krispies treats cereal if you try a new Kellogg's Rice Krispies treat material Deewar one taste is never enough yeah you tried a lot of cool but none of them had the taste of rice krispies treats totally totally crispy cereal so if you want to scarfing down big time remember you're not alone Kellogg's Rice Krispies treats here part of this complete breakfast one case now you can see on the back of the box here it features snap crackle and pop showing you how their treatment Sheen work to make this wonderful cereal they start by pouring rice into the krispies contraption then the crunching dome helps turn the rice into crunchy cereal the vitamin adds vitamins and minerals to the cereal the marshmallow flavour Rama adds the sweet gooey marshmallow taste then the hypersonic cluster Iser uses a mega power turbocharger to compress the cereal in the clusters and lastly the defector detector makes sure only the best clusters make it into your bowl now you can also see on the side of the box here they compare the sugar in this serum to other popular brands and you can see that there are nine grams per serving in this cereal this cereal is great I love that kids loved it it was delicious but sometime around the early 2000s it became harder to find Kellogg's still sold it but it wasn't in every grocery store and they changed the Box up a little too I have this box a couple years ago Walmart you can see they changed the color at a purple now snap crackle and pop are a little weirder looking there on the box and of course the most disappointing part the treats and the little clusters here aren't embossed anymore like they were on the original box and the recipe was actually slightly different as well this cereal contains milk and the ingredients whereas the original cereal didn't have that and I found the clusters to be a little smaller and it seemed like there were more crumbs in this cereal but essentially it was the same thing now if you take a look at the back of this box you can see it has the trio making rice krispies treats and a few games like a maze and a word search but the real gem on the back of this box is the descriptions of the three elves here now I know I'm pretty well-versed in cereal history and culture but I gotta admit that even I didn't know the three else has such different distinct personalities apparently Snap is the responsible one crackle is the jokester and pop is evidently the youngest brother and the center of attention I didn't know any of this so I guess you learned something new every day so this serie was chugging along for years just fine it was great consumers loved it there was nothing wrong with it then this year Kellogg's decided to give us all the middle finger and say oh you like that cereal well now we're gonna ruin it for you this here is the new box of Kellogg's Rice Krispie Treat cereal and you can see right off the changes on the box here first the treats is just a regular boring font no embossing nothing interesting and pop here is holding up a sign to let you know there's a new recipe for this cereal a quick glance of the bowl here reveals that the clusters are gone instead the cereals just sweetened rice krispies with marshmallows which by the way is an entirely new idea either marshmallow krispies were released way back in 1982 that cereal had multicolored marbles and I guess the Rice Krispies weren't sweetened in that version but it's not like this is a new groundbreaking idea let's take a quick look of the back of the box here it just shows snap crackle and pop making rice krispies treats you can see them decorating them in different designs with different add-ons well let's get right down to it and open this box and see what they've done to this cereal so here's what a bulb this new recipe of rice krispies treats cereal looks like it looks like a slightly glazed rice krispies and little plain marb it's definitely not as appealing as those little clusters that you used to see when you poured a bowl of this stuff let's hit it with some milk and give it a try I'm so disappointed it's just not the same I mean look if I never tried the original rice krispies treats cereal what I still dislike this stuff probably not it's not overtly bad it's a pretty tasty sweet cereal but it's just not rice krispies treat cereal that cereal had the perfect texture those clusters were so good and they're even better when you let them sit in the milk for a little bit that stuff was delicious and it actually reminded you of actual rice krispies treats whereas this version well it's just underwhelming compared to the original and I really just don't understand why they changed it was it too hard to make those clusters is it just cheaper probably right I mean that's gotta be the explanation unless there's some evil mr. Burnes type character sitting up in Kellogg's headquarters twiddling his fingers getting satisfaction out of making us all angry and annoyed with his decisions hey excellent I'm just gonna pretend that's how Kellogg's operates it's the easiest explanation for me so anyway you may still be able to find some of these old boxes on shelves if you see them pick them up and hold on to them while you can cuz all those old recipe boxes will be gone soon and all we'll have left is the current new inferior version unless we make enough noise online and harass Kellogg's to bring back their original recipe it could happen who knows fingers crossed alright well that's gonna do it for this update video of rice krispies treats cereal as always thank you for watching and until next time stay crunchy gotta love the snap crackle and pop down [Music]", "7hP7MG4MP6A": "hello uh i wasn't planning on making a video this week but uh a a thing that i like to do when i go to the grocery store even though i usually have a list of like i know exactly what i want to buy is i still just kind of wander through the aisles trying to you know see if there's anything new see if there's anything that sticks out um maybe something that you know i i haven't thought about but like i'll be like really good to make so i just you know quickly walk put down pretty much all the aisles it doesn't take very long because i mean i need to go to either end of the store anyway so i might just you know take a slightly longer path but this this week i was walking through and i found crispy rice which is the generic version of um rice krispies and but this one said gluten free on it which i was like i'm listening because usually there's a um malt flavoring in rice krispies that i can't have because malt is made from barley and barley against gluten so you know by the transitive property i can't eat it and so i haven't had uh the cereal or you know the rice krispie treats for almost four years and when i when i saw that um i figured let's let's let's make that it'll be fun and so i also have marshmallows and both of them have recipes on it so we're gonna we're gonna look at both of those here in a second and see which one's better which one we're gonna follow are we gonna combine the two it's going to be a fun time i also have uh some caramel that i made a few weeks ago for some ice cream that i'm going to also drizzle out on top and then i have some leftover chocolate chips from a previous thing as well then i'm just going to kind of like use those so this is going to be a little bit of like me cleaning out my pantry of you know odds and ends um and also making something that i haven't had in almost four years so i'm excited hopefully you're excited let's get into it all right let's look at these recipes both of them are pretty much the same this one calls for uh this one called for vanilla and this one doesn't have vanilla at all uh the other difference is this one pretty much calls for a pack of marshmallows well this one calls for 38 to 40 and a pack has so a serving size is four and then there are nine servings per container so that would give you assumingly that this is not lying to me 36 marshmallows in here which for the 38 to 40 is two less on the low end so they expect you to buy two bags and then just use two from there well that's that's not cool guys why would they do that just say a bag like you have the bag to say a bag why you gotta be making it be like no no no you need a bag plus two you can't you just can't do it with a single bag you gotta buy two of them somebody in the marketing department is patting themselves on the back on on that idea all right let's run through those ingredients obviously crispy rice uh we need crispy rice to make crispy rice marshmallow bars it's in the name butter marshmallows vanilla uh and then for toppings i'm going to use caramel chocolate chips because i'm just going to i'm just going to drizzle those on top at the end and hopefully it works well now that we've gathered uh all the ingredients pretty much the next step is to i guess just make it like that there is uh two little things of prep which is you know measure the cereal and then the butter it calls for a half a stick of butter so i'm gonna cut this in half which i figured you don't need to see that because why i guess it'd be cool if i just like sliced it not gonna work that's not a good idea don't don't do that it sounds like it would be cool but it won't it'll just end badly and you might hurt yourself don't do silly things with a knife if there's one thing you ever learned don't play with knives that being said let's go play with some heat and make some crispy rice treats [Music] so there you have it fresh crispy treats are done you can call it a day here or if you have you know chocolate chips laying around or caramel or anything else i guess like eminem stuff like that would uh would go well i'm going to uh melt this up and then i'm just going to drizzle it on top today we're taking it we're not we're not pushing ourselves to any limits today maybe maybe next week i'll try something challenging [Music] it's melted but it's pretty thick so my idea to kind of thin it out a little bit make it a little bit more uh fluid is i'm going to add just a little bit of coconut oil and hopefully that kind of thins it out and makes it easier to drizzle because right now it'll just be clumps and i don't want that i kind of want it you know somewhat even so i'm going to try this out and one way or another you're going to learn if this is a smart thing to do i'm going to have to live with my mistakes so you you come out of this either knowing how to solve this problem or knowing how not to solve this problem we'll find out here in like 20 seconds i'm just doing like a teaspoon amount i might need to microwave a little bit more to to melt this but i suspect that the heat from the chocolate itself should do the trick oh we are cooking with fire do you see that do you see that all right it's it's definitely uh the consistency that i want um i guess maybe you know one bit of hindsight is a little less so probably like half a teaspoon instead like a teaspoon that i use but i mean either way i'm not complaining uh and then i i mean my set of logic i'll just kind of walk you through why lean towards the coconut oil coconut oil is a solid at room temperature so i figured this would thin it out but later when it you know cooled off it would solidify again versus if you added like i guess the only other thing that i could think of maybe like vegetable oil um but that's a liquid so it might i don't know if it would put it in a state where it wouldn't solidify into like chocolate drizzle on top uh so that's why i won't coconut oil i'm sure that google has an answer if coconut oil isn't your thing but it worked for me so i'm happy let's put it on top [Music] and just like that we took normal recipes retreats and made them into fancy rice krispie treats they're also i mean we pretty much made art this is a jackson pollock painting right there look at that look at that um so i'm gonna go sell this on ebay and make all of the money and uh i'm just kidding i'm going to eat all of that and enjoy the art with my mouth and on that note uh bye mom still not dead see ya quick shot nailed it", "c9dF4bMQp3c": "pilot today we'll make some peanut butter rice krispies treats with a chocolate topping they're gonna be really good as nice little dessert here so we're gonna start off just basically making rice krispie treats let me get you down here where you can see I've got a pot here all about little turn about medium heat I guess it's um hey Nolan I've got all of us to stick of butter this about seven tablespoons of butter and put that in there but you'll select this butter melt in my pot okay soon as they get this butter melted up we'll go ahead and I'm going to add some peanut butter okay yeah our butter is just spotting us on my ass and peanut butter come just cut this jar of peanut butter will take spatula now I'm gonna take this big gonna pretend ibly about huh I'm gonna take one more little scoop let's see you'll have to be precise she's spilling buddies you likes about a cup of half the peanut butter in here so far today I'm gonna start us all around just let this melt try to sit down a little bit now off to bar just gonna make this really rich peanut buttery you butter is what we use to mount the marshmallows okay what you want to make sure that you get this painted butter completely melted for you adding marshmallows to like it looks pretty peanut buttery there yeah I'm gonna go ahead and get these marshmallows at it okay now I go down a little bit go ahead and add one bag this is one pound of miniature marshmallows a final measurements are easier to melt just going just gonna stir these around until they melt and we get a nice whip you know whipped almost like a whipped cream heavy whipped cream consistency this will just take a few minutes and just stir these marshmallows around - mmm okay so you can see the marshmallows a pretty much all melted I'm turning it down to almost a medium load on the other side of them keep whipping these until it gets all real smooth okay now I've got smooth I've got a 12 ounce box or rice krispies treats I'll just pour those in there I'm gonna turn the heat off and I'm gonna just stir these rice krispies treats into that mix this will take you know some good stirring keep whipping them around in there you've got enough residual heat here in the pot up there on the bottom to keep everything melted that you need to follow this over stir it in and you get everything really incorporated together you don't need them so rice krispies treats just dry you want to make sure everything is coated and that's sticky marshmallow coated okay this is the consistency you want you see how everything is all sticky all stuck together now what you want to do is turn your attention over to a I've got a Pyrex pan here and I've got it oiled with that you can either use butter or I actually use a little bit of a little bit of paint on here let me zoom out so you can see what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna pour this mixture into the pan the best I can okay then you want to take your hands and either spray-paint them on your hands or you want to have a little butter on there and get all out okay into that pan then you want just rub smash that push it down with your hands evenly in the pan you don't have to press down really really hard you're just trying to get it even up get it pretty even around the pan you can't want to be flat on top you don't want to meet lumps with your own comb about that chocolate coating and you want that to be kind of even so you go ahead and just push around here and get this to be nice little evening top and that's when we let that set up for a second while make chocolate topping now we're working on chocolate toppings Wow guys some milk chocolate mousse making chips here's to living a half ounces all right down the food microwave for 30 seconds after the 30 seconds is up a little taking out a little star okay 30 seconds is up and we'll take these we'll just stir it around with a silicon spatula you can see they're starting to melt but that's okay because we're gonna keep moving at 30-second intervals because you don't want to bar on the chocolate you could do this in a ball or if you want to say that this demands just a little bit easier a little bit quicker see up to the second time look if you can see really good it's a lot little melting so we'll just whip it limit here get everything wrong together now is this melting pretty much here this little portion up don't the rest of this bag we go back in for another 30 seconds help the second part smelt this first parts already melted okay so the second piece melted pretty good in their solvents oh nothing well got here I had a chocolate bar just all Hershey bar I crumble up I'm gonna crumble some pieces in there because I think I mean glue and extra chocolate just in case I'm crumble booboo hat in there now I'm gonna let it go back in there stir it up let it go for another 30 seconds okay now I got all this Chuck melted whipped in I'm just pouring over the top these rice krispies treats you can just pour it right down the middle for now because I'm gonna spread it out with the silicone spatula that's a lot of good chocolate this will give us a nice little chocolate crust here on top it's really really nice and that's why you know what these first crispy treats doing cool all the way first because yeah this is gonna kind of help to keep that chocolate warm why you spread it out over the rice krispie treats and you just wanna kind of get it even or it from the middle to the outside and even layer a chocolate over these rice krispies treats except Mike well I think one point enough chocolate spreading along because you know the reason you won't work from the inside out is because if you didn't have quite enough chocolate to reach the very very outside wouldn't be that big of a deal no but you do definitely want to have plenty of chocolate toward the middle so I'm gonna go ahead and get this nice and spread it out I'm gonna come back on show you what it looks like okay so you can see I get everything spread out all evenly and like so it doesn't have to be perfect now I'm gonna do it I'm gonna set this in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and let that chocolate set up okay I'm hoping for it for about 30 minutes it's still that soft in the middle not I'm gonna cut a piece off the side here just with a bit in safe down here it looks really good right something else kind of scoot down it without them it's a ceramics I don't like to crack that spoon try the five there okay hey kids you can see it's got that nice chocolate top to it there's nice peanut butter rice krispies treats I'm gonna go ahead and taste it wow it was really really good just really neat good desserts trial easy to do you", "FqZj8MIdWIs": "hey guys it's Danny and today's clean and delicious recipe is super fun because we're making homemade DIY kind bars now if you're not familiar with kind bars they are simply snack energy bars which are made of primarily nuts and seeds so here's all you're going to need some unsalted almonds unsalted peanuts chopped up walnut brown rice krispies cereal ground up flax seed meal some honey brown rice syrup a little sea salt vanilla extract your favorite dark chocolate chips and a little bit of coconut oil you will also need a 13 by 9 rimmed baking sheet that you sprayed with a little bit of cooking spray this is also known as a quarter sheet pan and then you're going to need a candy thermometer now I'm going to leave links down in the description box below showing you the tools that I'm using here today now if your nuts are not already toast if you're going to want to do that first all you do is lay them out on a big rooms baking sheet pop them into a 350 degree oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until they have become golden round and they smell fragrant a little tip when you are toasting nuts as soon as you start to smell them once they're fragrant that's usually a pretty good indication that they are just about done once the nuts have cooled I'm going to transfer them into a nice big bowl along with the brown rice krispies cereal and that ground flaxseed meal gently toss it all together and set it aside so now I'm going to make the syrup that holds the bars together and while this is not difficult it's a little bit tricky simply because you have to be kind of precise so here's what we're doing I have a medium sized saucepan and a candy thermometer now my candy thermometer hooks right onto the side of the pot and it is designed so that the tip of the thermometer does not touch the bottom of the pot but depending on the type of thermometer has you just have to make sure that that tip never hits the bottom of the pot because then you're not going to get an accurate temperature reading and we need to get an accurate temperature reading so that the syrup is at the right consistency okay so I've got my pot my candy to Mahmut arisen into the pot goes my honey brown rice syrup vanilla extract and the salt I'm going to gently stir that all together and then I'm going to turn my heat up to a medium now you really want to stay with the syrup okay I'm going to keep whisking it and stirring it as we go along and the goal is to reach two hundred and sixty degrees on the thermometer which is considered the hardball state now if this is the first time you're ever doing this it can seem a little confusing because the whole thing comes to a boil and it boils for quite a while before it actually reaches the right temperature so you just have to stay with it as it rises up and keep on mixing it as you go now you can see that my pot is really cutting it close here that syrup is really riding right up to the edge there so if you're making this at home I would try maybe using a slightly bigger pot but once you reach 260 and you can see on the thermometer 260 it's the hardball stage it says it right there you got to work kind of quick and efficiently so what I'm going to do is I'm shot my heat off gently pull this over to the counter remove the candy thermometer and then I'm going to pour it right on top of the nuts and then gently but efficiently you're going to need to stir this all together so that that syrup is coating all of the nuts and the cereal and the flax meal now this mixture tends to be a little bit thick and stiff so you want to make sure that you're using a good hearty spatula or wooden spoon to get the job done and once you've got everything coated everything is mixed together you're going to quickly and efficiently transfer the whole thing over to that half sheet pan that you had that you spray to the little cooking oil earlier so nothing sticks okay then I spray the cooking spray right on my hands it's the easiest way to do this without having everything stick to you and then you're just going to get right on in there and flatten out the top of this and you just keep working it until you have a nice smooth surface and any holes that you might see in between the nuts are smushed together and it's very easy to do with both of your hands you just keep at it now from here you could just leave it on the counter for about 20-30 minutes with the whole thing set up or if you wanted to speed the process up you could just pop it in the reefer for about ten minutes or so really I just wanted to be completely cooled down and firm and set up then you want to get out your cutting board because we are going to get that tray flip it upside down just Pat it on the back of couple times and you'll see that whole bar will just pop right out and from here we're going to cut it into twenty bars the easiest way to do this is to start by cutting it into quarters so half and then half again then take each section and do your best to create four equal cuts and you will end up with five bars and don't get too crazy about being perfect here they are homemade bars so we want them to have that homemade touch now to finish them off and this is the most fun part of the whole thing in my opinion because it's messy you're going to take chocolate chips along with that coconut oil pop it into your microwave for about a minute all microwaves vary so you want to keep an eye on it take it out give it a good stir so that it's melted and drizzle ready and then you're just going to take your spoon scoop up that chocolate and slowly drizzle it back and forth back and forth over each bar and you can do as little or as much chocolate as you fancy then once you've got all the chocolate done I just pop the whole tray right into the fridge for about 20 minutes or half an hour so all that chocolate can firm up and then they're ready to be stored grab your favorite airtight container if it's rectangular that's even better line the bottom with a little bit of parchment paper so nothing sticks then you just lay them in a single file put another piece of parchment paper on top and continue for as many that will fit in the container you just want to make sure that they're not touching each other because they will stick together these bars will last you weeks in the fridge and months in the freezer and they make awesome grab-and-go snacks they're perfect for lunchboxes and delicious with a hot cup of coffee mm-hmm you guys have got to make this one and when you do please snap a

if you like these copycat Duy I DIY do I I do yourself do DIY DIY ready so excited", "UNEDmT9Hfos": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today I'm gonna show you how to make chocolate and caramel crisp slices which are really really simple to make so let's get started you're going to need 100 grams of chocolate milk or dark and 60 grams of butter cubed and at room temperature you're also going to need about 60 grams of rice krispies or something similar and three full-size or four slightly smaller multipack sized bars which are chopped up so in a large bowl over a pan of simmering water you want to mix together the butter and the Mars bars what you're looking for is for all of the butter to be melted and for the chocolate to have started to melt but not be all the way there once you've got to that stage you just want to take it off the heat and stir it really vigorously until it's really glossy and smooth then you're going to add your rice krispies and you're going to stir them basically until they're fully coated but you have to do it pretty quickly and that's because this is just so much easier if that chocolate is still really really warm and what you want is for all of those white krispies to be completely coated in chocolate so you want a really nice even chocolatey look you don't want to see any whiteness and you want to make sure that you get all of it even from the bottom but you don't want to crush those Krispies so once you've got to that stage in a lined pan and mine is six inches by 7 inches and I've just lined it with foil and personally I just find that easier because it curls over the edges really nicely you just want to push down all of those rice krispies and get right into the corners and just make sure that it's as smooth as possible all the way across because that's the way you get really nice even bars in the microwave i melted my chocolate and i'm using milk but you could similarly use dark and all you want to do is using a palette knife or a spatula or the back of a spoon you just smooth that chocolate all the way across making sure that you get all of those edges and if you can try and get quite a nice pattern on the top so if you're doing your lines maybe make sure that they're all in one direction that sort of thing it just helps those bars look a little bit nicer once you're finished and then once you've done all of that you want to leave it on the side for about two hours and if you leave it on the side for two hours it should be ready for you to cut unless you live somewhere really hot so just make sure that that's a fairly cool place alternatively you could just pop it in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes and that will do the same job I just personally prefer to leave it on the side then all you need to do to serve it is just chop the sides off once it's completely set and then you can make it into eight bars like I did so thank you very much for watching as always I really hope that you enjoyed this video and you give it a go please comment just to let me know if this is the sort of video that you like and I will catch you in the next one thanks so much for watching", "ld8AEjlbB0o": "dtp hey we're dudes in space I'm Josh I'm Travis and I'm filler last week we made the cereal treat ice cream cones we're going to show you how we didn't want to make the same video twice so we made another entire video this week we're going to make a bowl we're going to make a cup and a spoon and we're actually gonna eat cocoa pebbles out of our cocoa pebble treat bowl so we're going to show you how we made these first you'll find a store of groceries for these streets you'll need cereal many many marshmallows and butter with ingredients assembled you'll need to grab your sauce pan or pot the standard cereal treats recipe calls for a quarter cup of butter 4 cups of malo and five cups of cereal we added a little extra malo so there be fewer holes melt your butter over medium heat don't wear an oven mitt because that would be really dumb take this time to open your cereal but this could be complicated if you're wearing an oven mitt measure out and add your malos you can immediately add in your cereal of choice at any time there is no need to watch the marshmallows melt when all the ingredients are added start stirring keep mixing until you have a consistent texture dump out and flatten your mixture between two pieces of wax or parchment paper really press hard to plug every little hole let your cereal treats lab cool for a few minutes to make shaping easier at this point if you are making an ice cream cone you would shape your treats around a piece of poster board rolled into a cone but we have grander plans wah wah wah this is what we made it's a bowl it's a spoon and it's a cup so what else would we get from this bowl of cocoa pebbles but a bowl of cocoa pebbles we needed some milk so I'm bigger we just completed with some chocolate milk all about that go go you know do we want to take bets on let's go home I personally feel it's gonna hold I personally hope that it holds its gonna hold I didn't even put anything under this because I had faith this is gonna hold there we go there it goes all right and a glass of chocolate milk hey that's leaking oh all right does it taste like those coke guys good dud not a drip out of the cup I'm gonna buy this phone now

"Yd_9P56xlh4": "Stop! You're making me laugh! Now I have an eyelash in my eye. Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode\nof Laura in the Kitchen, I wnat to share a really quick and easy treat with you that's\nso perfect for this time of year, these are my fruity rice crispy treats, now I made them\nnot too long ago for a party I went to which was a first birthday party, and everyone raved! They've been around for a while, I keep seeing\npictures pop up of these and I figured I wanted to share with you because it really is the\nperfect treat to bring to a party whether it be Easter or a birthday or a baby shower\nor even a wedding shower, they're so fun and they're absolutely delicious because I make\nmine a little extra gooey and they're so good, the texture of these is just bomb diggity,\nand I think you are going to love them. You can be playful with the cereal that you\nuse but I think that this particular combination which is sort of the classic version of fruity\ncrispy treat is the best, and the combination of the extra marshmallows and stuff just makes\nthem to die for. Don't take my word for it, just make them,\nyou'll understand and when I posted the picture of these on my Instagram stories, which if\nyou don't follow me there you should, link down below, everyone, I literally got hundreds\nof people asking for the recipe so I'm going to share it with you because it's a great\none to have in your back pocket and you can have your kids help you make them and if my\nkid wasn't outside playing bubbles right now, she may be in here too, but those are way\nmore fun. The list of ingredients is very short and\nsweet, you'll need a combination of your rice cereal and your fruity cereal, now you don't\nwant to do half and half because it'll be too strong of a fruity flavor, so I do three\nquarters of the rice cereal and one quarter of the fruity, but you can do half and half,\nyou can do whatever your heart desires because you're the boss apple sauce. You need lots and lots of mini marshmallows,\nyou need some unsalted butter, then you'll need some vanilla and a pinch of sea salt. The sea salt might sound crazy, they don't\ntaste salty but it makes them - salt in sweets does the same thing that it does in savory\nfood, it sort of brings everything to life, it opens up your palette and it makes something\ntaste even more delicious. So in a big pot, we need butter, I never follow\nthe ingredients on the back of the box because they're just not gooey enough for me and that's\njust not how I roll, and I also do not put this amount of rice crispy treat mixture in\na 9 by 13 because nobody wants a thin rice crispy treat! I want a thick gooey delicious rice crispy\ntreat, so for this amount, a 9 by 9 is perfect, a 9 by 9 pan, if you use a 9 by 13 and you\nget thin rice crispy treats, I'm going to come over! Don't let me catch you do that, use a 9 by\n9 because if you're going to make a treat you might as well go all the way, right? I'm just going to wait for the butter to melt,\nI don't want to burn this and I don't want to brown it because I do love brown butter\nin regular rice crispy treats, but with the fruity flavor it comes a little bit off for\nme, so I'm just going to melt this until it's just about fully melted and then we add in\nthe marshmallows. Beautiful! Now you're going to add all of your marshmallows,\nand you're just going to cook this on medium-low heat, I don't want to burn the marshmallows,\nyou're just going to cook this until everything just melts and this is when I like to add\nmy pinch of salt. You don't need a lot, you could use regular\ntable salt but I like sea salt. And you just mix mix mix until all the marshmallows\nare pretty melted. That looks so ooey gooey. I'm going to add a splash of vanilla. Stir that in, oh it already smells so good. As soon as that vanilla hits, you're in business. Then you add your cereal. Mix that all in, I'm telling you these were\nsuch a giant hit at the party, and that's when I knew I had to share it with you because\nI mean, you just don't know. It's like a crime and it's funny because every\ntime on my Instagram if I share something in my stories, a recipe that you know could\nbe a really simple thing that I haven't shared with you here, so many people get mad at me\nthey're like you have to share it and then I'll reply and be like \"it's so easy!\" and\nthey're like \"Who cares! You're the queen of easy, we just need your\nsimple recipes and ideas\" and so no matter how easy things are I have decided I will\nshare them with you so I don't get all that. Alright, so everything's mixed, I turned this\noff. That is the best part that's stuck on the\nwooden spoon, but I'm not going to embarrass myself right now. I'm just going to get it all off of here. Oh look at that! See how ooey and gooey those are going to\nbe? Trust your girl. And then I've got a 9 by 9 inch pan ready\nand waiting, these are going to be thick and gorgeous. Now, they're really hard to spread with a\nspatula so take your hand, dip it in some water, and press them down. If it keeps sticking, just keep re-dipping\nin that water and that will make everything not stick. See? Alright, just want to pat these down as even\nas you can manage, and don't worry that it's really hot, it's warm but it's really not\nthat hot. Because once the marshmallows melted Ijust\nturned off the heat. Alright this is looking good, now these just\nneed to sit cool and set. Sit cool and set, I should have that on a\nT-Shirt. Sit cool and set. And I'm going to just have these sit on the\nside for typically a couple hours, doesn't even take that long. I'm going to set these aside and when they\nare done, we're going to cut into them and we are going to dig in and you are going to\nlove them. Alright these have been sitting for a couple\nof hours, and they are ready to be dug into. Oh and they're going to be so good. So sticky, and so delicious. Oh my goodness. You can do fun shapes too if you want to using\ndifferent cookie cutters. I'm not that patient, but you could. Tadaa! There's never been a better rice crispy treat\nin your life! So sticky. Dense but sticky and delicious. Look at that! Mmm Mmm! That's a rice crispy treat that's worthy of\nbeing on your treat table for whatever the occasion, because I'm telling you they are\nthat good, and they're so easy and they look festive without you having to do anything\nto them, but they really are so delicious, they're so good! You'll love them! And like I said, any recipe - any occasion,\nwhatever you've got, they're just that good. The store bought ones, nothing on this! Nothin! LauraintheKitchen.com has the recipe for you,\nmake them, won't be disappointed. I'll see you next time. Bye!", "9uf7w06xhrA": "the things you'll be needing our summer Rice Krispies some Oreos marshmallows some chocolate chips or chocolate for melting and butter ok guys so the first thing I'm doing is melting our butter and this is a fourth cup of butter so just take a large pot and melt it over the stove ok so our butter is all melted by the way I have my heat on about medium low so now we're going to add our marshmallows and this is a 10 ounce bag of miniature marshmallows so go ahead and add that to your pot of melted butter and we're just going to constantly stir this until all of our marshmallows are melted and I also want to add that before I started to melt my marshmallows I actually already crushed my Oreos you want to use about two cups and you already want to have them crushed because you want to add them to the rice krispies mixture you know before it starts to harden all right so our marshmallows are almost melted so now it's time to add our rice krispies cereal and I already pre-measured out six cups so I'm just going to add that right on in probably in two separate batches so I added the first and I'm going to stir and then the rest of it so we're just going to stir this all around until all of our rice krispies are coated with the marshmallows all right so our cereal is coded so now we're going to add our crushed Oreos and we're just going to fold the Oreos in with the rice krispies and the marshmallows and with Oreos of course you can add however much you want I did about two cups so I'm certain these in and then I'm going to add a little bit more alright next we're going to take a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and I sprayed it with nonstick cooking spray that is very very important so that your rice krispies treats don't stick and we're just going to pour them right on in the pan and then you just want to press down until they form into the pan and I also find that if you use your hands to press down the rice krispies treats its way easier so now we are going to refrigerate these until they are completely cool before we cut them into squares and dip in the chocolate alright guys so I rice krispie treats have been chilling in the fridge and I cut them into squares and this is the thickness of them if you want them thinner you can actually use two separate pans and it will make them just a little bit thinner so now what we're going to do is melt our chocolate in a microwave-safe Bowl I also chopped a few more Oreos just a place on the top alright so here is our melted chocolate by the way I used about four ounces of chocolate and so now we're just going to take the rice krispie treats and by the way I also place these on a plate just so they would be easier to grab and separated them now we're just going to dip the very tip of one of the edges into the melted chocolate just like that and place it on aluminum foil or parchment paper or whatever and then I'm also going to go back and add a few of the chopped Oreos right on top and I have a strong feeling that these won't last long because rice krispie treats especially with Oreos these are like caches for your route favorite snack alright guys so here I be chocolate covered oreo rice krispie treats on a serving plate just be sure that you let them completely dry before transferring them so I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did leave a like and I will talk to you guys later", "Ckw5r6cuMsU": "hey everyone Val here and I'm going to get ready to make a little treat for the kids for caritas tonight and I'm going to be making a captain

tablespoons of unsalted butter and to that I'm adding ten ounces of mini marshmallows many just because they melt more quickly and easily you can use the big ones you can cut them up it's up to you give that a stir then add 3/4 of a cup of natural peanut butter crunchy or fine I think what find is probably better for the binding properties and 1/4 teaspoon of salt stir everything together over sort of a medium ish heat until it's melted that'll just take a couple minutes these cereal bars are so fun and you can bury them so greatly basically you just need to bind it together with your butter marshmallow mixture and you can do almost anything I'm using chocolate rice krispies I've made stuff with Cheerios honey nut cheerios plain rice krispies I mean the list goes on everything is nicely melted together and it smells so good and then pour in your melted marshmallow mixture make sure you get every last bit because this is where most of the deliciousness comes from then stir your marshmallow peanut butter mixture into your chocolate rice krispies make sure that all of your chocolate puffed rice cereal is fully coated because when you're fully combined and the mixtures had a little bit of an opportunity to cool off you're going to add a cup of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips and a half a cup of chopped toasted peanuts roasted peanut combine them that way you have to do it yourself want to make sure that your mixture is cool just a little bit otherwise the chocolate chips will melt make sure you're using a really big bowl gooey deliciousness everything's combined ready to go this is an 8x8 baking dish I just lined it with parchment paper spray it with a little bit of vegetable oil and then spray the parchment with oil again and then press your cereal mixture evenly into your dish oh my gosh why this is like escaping this cereal mixture does not want to be eaten it's going to be really really full it's a nice thick bar it's edible now but you want it to cool down enough that you can cut it press it in evenly see how full it is mine's kind of overflowing I bet if I used my hands easier doing it going for it guys I'm using my hands these are fantastic for bake sales perennial E popular once you've washed your hands let your bars set for at least 20 minutes and up to 12 hours just until it sets when your bars are completely set lift them out using your parchment paper and cut them into 12 bars or 16 or whatever so remember like 2 seconds ago when I said to cut it into 12 bars and then once I said cut it into 16 I just totally cut it

have four cups of mini marshmallows or just a bag of marshmallows is perfectly fine like so you don't have to really measure it but you know I did take out a few marshmallows so if you have more marshmallows that's always good and then you'll need butter okay so with the butter you will need three tablespoons of butter so you have margarine or substitute of butter that is perfectly fine to do as well so you do about three tablespoons of that okay and put the rest away and then we're going to put this in the microwave for two minutes and then we need to have a spatula or something ready to stir as soon as it gets out okay guys alright okay now that it's out of the microwave we're just gonna stir stir it up okay and that we want to quickly add our cereal treats our cereal if you have

the kids and if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet please do so firstly I'm going to pour 175 grams of honey into a pot and make sure the heat is super low and then a hundred seventy-five grams of smooth peanut butter with it so make sure you get all 107 grams of the peanut butter it's very important that the measurements are exact and a dash of vanilla I'm spraying some coconut oil into the pan just to help the peanut butter and break down a bit so I'll be spraying coconut oil while I'm stirring it throughout if you have just a jar of coconut oil you can put about 50 grams of coconut oil straight into the pot and just stir it all together you want a nice smooth creamy consistency so make if you are using a coconut spray make sure you just sort of gradually add it in but like I said if you just have like the normal raw coconut oil you could just put that in with everything and stir very well [Music] once you've got the consistency you'd like take it off the heat straightaway and don't waste any time in adding your rice cereal you can use rice krispies IV Coco Pops or any brown rice cereal just any rice cereal will do it's absolutely up to you and also you can use your own nuts your own preferred nuts butter it doesn't have to be peanut butter can be almond butter if you choose so make sure you combine the rice cereal really well I once all combined you can transfer it into a lined dish right make sure to flatten it into the dish very well make sure it's nice and flat you don't want it to be bumpy or anything just take your time with this bit and make sure that all the corners are covered and it's super nice and flat once you're done flattening your Big Shot then it's literally ready to go into the fridge leave it in the fridge for 45 minutes to an hour so that

Today I have St. Patrick's Day Limited Edition Lucky Charm Chocolate Cereal.  I didn't even realized I got the chocolate one until I got home.  But I am glad I got it because it's so chocolatey and delicious\ud83d\ude0b Have you had oat milk before. I am having it with my cereal. One of friends have been recommending me to try it for awhile.  I finally decided to try it and I love it. In my opinion, it's creamier than other milk alternatives I had before.  I separated out some of the green clover marshmallow in the cereal because supposedly it will turn the milk green.  I wanted to test it. Do you think the clovers will turn the milk green?  Do you also think the oat milk will affect the clovers magical abilities to turn the milk green?  Stay tune to find out! Believe it or not, I haven't had cereal over 5 years because I was trying be healthy. This cereal is tasting really good right now to me. Oh how I miss sugary cereal! My favorite cereals when I was younger were Golden Grahams and Honey Nut Cheerios. Do you have any favorite cereals?  It looks like the cereal is turn my milk more brown then green.  I guess the green marshmallow is turn the milk a little green.  I used a rice krispies treat recipe to make a lucky charm treat. I tried to shape the treat into a clover.  What you think? Yay or nay for the clover?  Btw I put a link to the recipe in my description box.  I am starting to get really full.  Sugary milk is one of the best part of eating cereal. Don't you agree\ud83d\ude0b? Thank you so much for the support\ud83d\udc95It means a lot to me.  This is 10 minutes after eating. I am not sure if you can tell but the clover did turn the milk into a latte color. So I guess it does work but takes some time. ", "6k8bHyeIKIU": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make homemade granola bars and this is what they look like when you make a granola bar it's a combination of rolled oats and I put in a little bit of rice cereal and then we bind and sweeten these ingredients with a with honey with golden syrup and butter and then if you want what I have done here is I've also added some dried cherries and chocolate chips so we're gonna start with preheating our oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then you will need a 9-inch square pan which is 23 centimeters and I like to well you can either butter it or I'm just going to use a one of these nonstick sprays and do the bottom and the sides and then to make sure it doesn't stick I also use just a square of parchment paper on the bottom okay so now the first thing we need to do is to melt our butter so I just have a small saucepan I mean you could do it in the microwave and you will need four tablespoons which is 55 grams of butter you can use either salted or unsalted here and I've just cut it into small squares so it'll melt a little faster okay so I'm just gonna put this on medium-low heat and start to melt it you can see it's just starting to melt so what I'm gonna do is add in a third of a cup 80 milliliters of golden syrup because I want two golden syrup is very thick and I want to thin it out just a bit so I put over the heat and then I'm also going to add a third of a cup 80 milliliters of honey I'm using a mild flavored honey but really you can use you know any flavor just keep in mind the flavor of the honey will affect the flavor of your granola bars now both of these are to bind like I said the oats together but it's and sweetened it but if you don't want to use honey and gold and syrup other choices are you could use corn syrup you could use agave you could use brown rice syrup or even maple syrup so really I'm giving you kind of a template for how you can personalize your granola bars at home to your own and your family's tastes so that's that looks good I'm going to turn that off and take it off the heat and then for flavoring you to add a little more flavor you don't have to do this I'm going to add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract so I like the flavor of that also now this is it's a little warm so I'm just going to leave this on the counter for maybe you know 5-10 minutes just till it cools down to room temperature so this mixture has cooled to room temperature now I think I forgot to mention when I poured my my honey and my golden syrup you might have noticed how easily it came out of the measuring cups and that is because I sprayed them before I put the honey and the golden syrup in there because as you know those those ingredients are very sticky and they tend to cling to the side so if you spray it or oil it or butter it they're just very lightly your measuring cup it would slide out so much easier so now in a large bowl have two cups a hundred and eighty grams of I'm using old-fashioned rolled oats and that you can see there that's a really thicker texture than the instant or quick cooking and I just like it gives you a more your granola bars a more chewy chewiness to it now you could use the thinner ones if that's what you prefer and then to that I'm going to add a half a cup 15 grams of a rice cereal like rice krispies and I'm doing this for a couple reasons it kind of lightens the texture of the granola bar and then it also adds a little bit of crunchiness which I like and then a little salt quarter of a teaspoon now you use salted butter you could just leave out that salt and then you can you know how you buy granola bars you know there's so many things you can put in nuts all kinds of dried fruit chocolate chips mini miniature marshmallows and really this is where you can just decide for yourself what you want in your granola bars I really like chocolate chips so I'm putting a quarter of a cup which is about 40 grams of you know pretty small semi-sweet or maybe these are bitters weekend semi-sweet bittersweet white milk whatever you like and then I like I like the dried cherries I find that that tart get sweet flavor is really good and I'm using again a quarter of a cup which is about 35 grams of dried cherries so just mix it up whatever you want leave it out I mean really whatever you want to do experiment what your kids like and then just mix it all together and then I'm going to just pour in our liquid here so I'm not using any white or brown sugar I find from the honey and the golden syrup is sweet enough for me some people actually like it a little sweeter and then you could add a little brown sugar or white sugar that's what's so great about granola bars I mean you can just kind of do what you want invent your own recipe at home and then I'm just stirring it together pretty easy okay I just want to make sure everything's really moistened here that looks good Wow take my pan and just pour it all in there we're going to spread this out I'm just using you use back of the spoon or I'm using an offset spatula try to get as even as possible and then you want to kind of make sure you press down to compact it you can do that or you can just sometimes once I get it even you can just you know get your hands just a little moistened with some water and just Pat it down to really compact it in there yeah it looks good let's see pretty easy you save yourself a lot of money making your own okay right my hands so now we're going to bake these now somewhere between I'd say 22 to 25 minutes you want you bake them at least till the taught they're golden brown the oats have come nice and golden brown and the longer you bake these the more crisp they would they will be if you like your granola bars quite soft and chewy then just bake them around that I find around that 22 minutes and if you want them a little more crunchy then just bake them a few more minutes okay so our granola bars are done you can see they are a beautiful golden brown color now they are if you kind of feel it is really soft it actually takes probably a couple of hours for the granola to firm up so what I'm going to do is let it cool just down just a little and then when we come back I'm going to cut it into bars so now it's been about 10 minutes and the granola has firmed up enough for me to cut it in two strips so for what I like to do is cut the boat across tier 6 equal strips which will be about one and a half inches for each one 4 centimeters and just use a sharp knife if you find it's still too soft just wait a little longer and then of course you can cut them into any size shape you want and then I'm just going to turn it and cut it just right across the middle it so they kind of looked like what you buy but the size and shape so there that's a good so now what I'm going to do like I said they are still very soft I'm going to leave probably a couple hours and then they become really nice and firm and then I just use a offset spatula you can use a knife to get them out of your pan now the first day they will be very crisp and nice and chewy if you store them at room temperature overnight they will soften if you want to keep them quite crisp then I then I usually store them in the refrigerator so these ones I did make yesterday and I did store them in the fridge so they're still quite firm you don't just try a little bit yes they are especially the edges that's part nice and crispy and they're chewy and you know they're just using the honey and the golden syrup I find they're just sweetened up boy tasty so make them I mean you'll save yourself a lot of money from it and enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski enjoy baking calm [Music]", "ZTim9QQQeKo": "hey guys it's Gabi and today we're making homemade granola bars and I can promise you you'll never buy store-bought granola bars ever again like it's so embarrassing lazy first thing we're gonna do is combine a two and a half cups of old-fashioned oats and half a cup of almonds and just chop them up toss this all together we're just gonna put these right onto the baking sheet with a little bit of parchment paper and then just spread them into an even layer and then these are gonna go into a 350 degree oven for like seven to ten minutes you just kind of want to toast the almonds and the oats and like really bring out all the flavor and then we'll make the topping okay so while we're toasting the oats and almonds we're gonna put all this stuff into our pot so we have 1/4 of a cup of butter 1/3 of a cup of honey teaspoon of vanilla extract teaspoon of chia seeds like a teaspoon of Maldon sea salt we'll finish this mixture off with fourth of a cup of brown sugar I think that was that I can't really remember anymore we're just gonna take a spatula combine all that in and then bring it to a boil we want everything to combine the sugars to melt stir that together and let it go alright so take the butter mixture we're gonna put it right on our cutting board and then grab the toasted oats and these can go back in the same Bowl okay so we're just gonna dump this whole mixture into our toasted oats and almonds and just make sure you get out all the chia seeds and anything that might be stuck to the bottom of this pan and just give this a toss and as everything starts to combine like you can see the butter mixture coat all the oats all the almonds so like everything is delicious we're just gonna toss into half a cup of dried fruit and then mix it together so we're gonna let this cool for a second like maybe five minutes then add the chocolate chips so you can still see them and they look cute okay so we're just going to use an 8 a 9 by 9 something like that baking dish and I'm actually going to use this same parchment paper that I used to toast those press that down into the bottom and then remember that baking spray we're just gonna use a little bit more okay this is just gonna go right into here and then we'll sprinkle the chips on top if you want if you still a baking spray just spray the back of your spatula and then not very much sticks to the back of your touchless look at that it looks good right so if you don't like chocolate who doesn't like chocolate you could leave it like this but I'm just gonna sprinkle on maybe 1/4 a cup of these mini chocolate chips right on top put a couple more chips on and then take your spatula again just press everything together I mean who doesn't want to eat that as is okay so we're just gonna transfer this to the fridge let it sit for an hour or two and then we can cut them up okay and look they're hardened up ready to go and this is why we put the parchment paper in we're just gonna lift them up and transfer them right to the cutting board I mean basically no cleanup easy okay you can chop these into squares rectangles like I'm kind of reliving my childhood with these so we're going rectangles and just cut them all up I mean how good did these look you could wrap them up in some plastic wrap store them in the fridge put them in Tupperware they actually freeze really well if you want to freeze them and like make them last for a couple months and that's it WAV cheaper than buying them from the store and hundred times more delicious [Music]", "HdqTAvIwuA8": "ah my

try to make a treat that looked and tasted like chocolate-covered strawberries all you need is a microwave and some patience so let's get into it here's what you'll need strawberry Rice Krispies and Cocoa Krispies actually didn't realize until I got home that I bought cocoa pebbles but they ended up working out fine too marshmallows salted butter cocoa powder red food coloring and some green grass bento / suji dividers that I found at Daiso so I filmed as I experimented but I believe I got to an easy method that works for my first attempt I mixed the strawberry and regular rice krispies because the strawberry flavor tasted a little strong when mixed together the taste is really nice on its own but mix it chocolate the strawberry flavor isn't as prevalent so I recommend sticking with all strawberry which makes this easier anyway [Music] to make the strawberry treats follow the original Rice Krispies recipe six cups of rice krispies three tablespoons of butter and forty large marshmallows I usually put the marshmallows and cut up butter into a large microwave safe Bowl and microwave for about a minute or two until the marshmallows fluff up and the butter is clearly melted I also recommend adding a few drops of red food coloring to your marshmallows before mixing in the cereal for a more vibrant color mix in the rice krispies until they're all evenly coated and then you can start molding them into shapes since this is hot and sticky I spare my hands with cooking spray so the treats are easier to work with I started by making strawberry shapes particularly skinnier and longer shapes with the idea of coating the chocolate sheets on top much like dipping real strawberries and chocolate as I was forming the shapes I realized I was working with Rice Krispies and coating could be messy and thick so I decided to also make shapes that look like little button mushrooms this worked out extremely well because a chocolate treats had a base to stick to and it was easy to form the rest of the strawberry shape once all of the strawberries have been formed cover and set aside while making the chocolate treats to do this follow the same rice krispies recipe but before mixing in the cereal mix three tablespoons of cocoa powder to the marshmallow butter mixture until smooth then add the cereal I kind of made a mess but scooped out a bunch of the treats to cool off a bit and be easier to work with I grabbed a handful and formed the pointed end of the strawberry from the bottom of the mushroom base this worked out so much better than trying to coat the bottom half of an already formed strawberry which resulted in lumpiness and the treat falling off but the strawberry leaf tops I use those little plastic green grass dividers for bentos and sushi I cut into the jagged edge randomly along some of the lines about half of the way down and folded it up tightly about every two lines I then used a knife to cut a small incision into the treat where the top of the strawberry is I cut in about half an inch and insert of the leaf about halfway in as well I then fanned out the tops of the leaves and place the tree upside down to get the tops to stay this way I honestly didn't leave them upside down for long only while I was working on the rest of the treats but I'm sure the longer you let them sit this way the flat as it leaves would lay and that's it even while stumbling to figure out how to make this work overall it was relatively easy and simple I think it looks and tastes great for spring temp treat and hope you try this out thanks so much for watching", "JYjYcwgq6_0": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today I'm going to attempt to do chocolate-covered Oreos chocolate-covered pretzels and chocolate cover rice krispie treats I never did it before but it's something I wanted to try something I wanted to do so I was like what's you know what can I lose so I decided to do a video on it so well no further ado come on with me and let's get started okay so what I have here is a candy milk machine pot whatever you want to call it that I bought to attempt this chocolate cover dessert I would say I don't know so let's see like I said this is my first time you guys trying to do anything like this so I took it out of the box i watch this thingamajiggy it said just make sure it was dry before you know you put your chocolate in it which it is dry so I'm going to plug it up and it said turn it the button on to the last button over here on this one right here so the button is all way over there and it says that it sit for five minutes before applying your chocolate which I have white and I have blue let's see how this turn out I'll be back in five minutes now I'm gonna add my cami let's do blue first it's warm all says add a little at a time and it's melting yeah so okay so we're just gonna bring it up so y'all can see you can see is melting sniffing really fast actually so once this milk complete completely we would store it our candy has melted completely so it just says stir occasionally and turn it to the second button on here so that's what I have just did and now I'm just going to start dipping so I have my rice krispies treats here which I did one I figure I would do one on camera to show you guys will do eight blues so I have my mistakes here just some regular cookie skips here open up my rice krispies treat no my chocolate over here I'm just gonna take a stick and stick it at the bottom which is gonna come out really easily you see the hole it's gonna come out really easy but I'm gonna show you guys something once I get them all let's go get them all stuff [Music] I have stuck all of my rice krispies treats I don't know guys I'm super excited like I never did this before I guess that's why I'm so excited anyway so I have stuck the stick in there and I can't I told you it's a hole they come out very easily so what we're going to do is take a stick and roll it around and the chocolate like that and we're going to stick it right on in there and allow it to sit so you want to do all of them like that so as you can see I have the distinct sand chocolate and stuck it in the rice krispies treat of all of them yay so we're just gonna allow them to say it's about three to five minutes so now that our sticks has set for about five minutes someone's a little loose it's okay just be really careful so I'm just gonna dip my first crispy treats in here which I'm gonna take this knife they help me spread it because this pot is not really deep so the part it is to keep the chocolate milk bit at a good temperature I am I could have used a stove pot but I mean I couldn't use the chocolate on the stove put it in the pot on the stove but then you know it would be non consistent you know too hot too cold too hot so to avoid that I just bought this pot from Walmart I think for like 20 bucks something like that so I'm just cleaning it up now that I have icing all over it just cleaning it up it should look something like that and you want to lay it on wet paper so I have wet paper here so we're just gonna move right along this is really fun this is a good DIY you can do with your kids it's really safe you know you don't have to worry about my novel saying the stove I and the pot is really easy to clean [Music] crispy treats has been dipped in chocolate now all I'm gonna do is sprinkle a little sprinkles on it before it dries so I have a multipack sprinkling mix so I'm just gonna choose one of these and sprinkle now which I'm gonna go with this one here just sprinkle on them you come out so there you have it I sprinkled them with sprinkles so now I'm gonna now them to sit for like 30 minutes and why they sit in I'm going to do front soles so what I have here is 12 purser eyes which I'm going to do the same exact way as I did a rice krispie treats [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] time consuming but good so now I'm gonna take our wrinkles but I had earlier and I'm going to use this one the white one like that now that have a rice krispy has dried see they didn't even stick to the wax paper that's why you want to use wax paper I have a a piping bag here which I have cut and I have white chocolate in it I'm just gonna drizzle it over top of the rice krispies I've just got it out of the microwave and it's super heart burn my hand so I have drizzled our rice krispies treats with white chocolate and they're pretty I think I'm doing a good job for this to be my first time so I get an A for effort next all I'm gonna do is do the same thing for my pretzels so I have drizzle white chocolate on top of our pretzels yay I'm excited [Music] due to limited chocolate I'm not able to dip my Oreos like I want to so I have like this much white in this much blue so with that being said I might make you do what they do I'm a drizzly there we go our drizzled Oreos or there's a wheel that's the way men and I had enough chocolate to dip them but I was able to do something these are our chocolate colored desserts and I'll cupcakes and this is my room at my job that I did all of this for my tree yes those are real presents for my co-workers my table arrangement my punch yes I did a beautiful job you guys Jagr I did it once again it's not perfect but it's perfect enough for me so I hope you guys enjoy this video and stay tuned for the next video Internet star thanks for watching [Music]", "ZaCwFDzRjag": "hello everybody mark here and today I'm gonna be doing Rice Krispies now the it's not like me I know it's not like me to buy the name brands but I couldn't find any shot brands of the rice krispies in the shop so and to buy these these are two pounds 510 grams rice krispies with marshmallows now show you those what I've done I took about eight or ten or 12 or something marshmallows well it did I cut them up and then put them into the tray what would i but the the rice krispies in the tray so I knew how much it was gonna fill the tray put the marshmallows in after they would cut up which wasn't easy by the way once you cut them in half they the inside is really sticky and it was a it was hell trying to get them actually off the knife I mean another thing here but what I've done I've cut them in halves or quarters and put them in with the rice krispies and once you once you get them covered with rice krispies they they they're no longer so much of a problem because when the rice krispies stick to the sticky part then they they they stop sticking to the bowl and to your fingers and tear everything up so hopefully we can get these so this is rice krispies a marshmallow nothing else and hopefully even get some good chocolate bar action going now there we go I've got the chocolate is pretty much melted in this jug there we go so what I'm gonna do is take the no take the jug and I'm gonna dry it off just like before because we don't want any water when I pour the gerbil I pull the chocolate into the mixture here I don't want any water from the outside of the jug that is really important if water gets in the chocolate then your bones pretty much okay so you want to absolutely dry on the outside okay so there we have it so there's not what this is about what one-and-a-half bars of the usual usual chocolate bar there that I've used on the other recipes so we're gonna this chocolates a little bit thicker than the rest of it I don't know why that is I think it might be because it's it's mixing with the dried reminisce that was in there that you know I try to scrape all the chocolate out but there will be some left and once the the new chocolate mixes up with a hard chocolate there's already been melted and then drying again I think that's what's causing it to be the point quite thick anyway this is that's my theory okay so now we've got a chocolate in there and I'm hoping this is gonna be enough to coat all the all the rice krispies and the marshmallow yeah actually yeah it's gonna be borderline I think I might better just about make it cuz that's the trouble if you if you've got to if you've got too much chocolate like I said before if you've got too much chocolate you just add more ingredients whether it's chocolate whether it's sorry more ingredients whether it's more cornflakes or whether it's more rice krispies or whatever cereal you're using that's if you've got too much chocolate but if you if you have less chocolate than you need it can be a bit of a problem because that means that some of these cereal doesn't get covered in chocolate which is a bit of an issue anyways I think we might just be able to make this happen just about you know get all from the sides there yeah see that's the thing I earned hopefully the marshmallows will have even themselves out so when they go it goes into the tray over there each bit that you cut from the pot you know the chunk each segment hopefully I'll have a bit of marshmallow means there's quite a lot of marshmallow there it's pretty much just about made it in there you know with the amount of chocolate you know everything's covered anyway so okay scrape the excess off the spatula thing and what I've done I because you saw at the beginning aisles I put it all into the tray here so I knew roughly I knew pretty much where is gonna how deep beans gonna be all right this is a bit awkward again leaning over the hot water there this is gonna be a bitter it's gonna be quite a thick chocolate bar cereal bar okay right they have it so that is all all gone now I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna flatten this down before it does theirs while you as it's cooling they stand a hard-enough so I want to flatten this down into this desired shape in this case it's the aluminium foil tray that the chicken dinners come in you can use that you can even use a plate which you know although the plate won't be ideal because Italy you know or it'll be an old circular shape and it's a bit more harder bit more difficult to regulate the thickness of the chocolate cake chocolate pie okay so there you have it that is as if I turn that like that and then yeah you can see it's a lot it's it's almost as thick as the tray itself okay so when the hardens out I'll tip it upside down into a plate cut it into sections and hopefully they'll be as a marshmallow there there's another marshmallow there I can see a few yeah hopefully there'll be a marshmallow in every in every chunk it does an awful community okay so there yeah we're just there there you go so there you have it that's the rush Krispies and marshmallow and I didn't put any peanuts in there the the the ones I use those for the cornflakes but I figured inari be plenty with a marshmallow so there you go I'll do a follow-up review shortly and let you know how it tastes and and then you can either you know I mean if you take this idea and you can make these for Christmas parties birthday parties that you know they're really fairly cheap I mean it's two quid for a box of cereal but if you use the shop brands you can get that way down one of the cheaper bars of chocolate I've used a pound a bar you can't get much cheaper than that for a hundred and thirty five grams and marshmallows were out one pound you know and you probably get like two dozen in there I've got a dozen in here already you know and and that's that okay anyway thank you for watching bye bye", "u4S6GnOx68U": "Hi guys I\"m Laura Vitale and on this episode\nof Laura in the Kitchen I'm going to show you a re ally easy treat. This is a scotcharoo - the way I like to think\nof a scotcharoo is kind of like a hybrid between a buckeye which is a delicious little rice\ncereal peanut butter chocolate ball, and a butterscotch rice crispy treat. Mix them to combine, and that's what you get. And they are so good, absolutely addictive,\nwhen you make these get them out of your house as soon as humanly possible because you will\nconsume the entire 9 by 13 pan, I should know because I have tried. Let me run you through the ingredients, the\nlist is short and sweet, kind of like me, you need some rice cereal to start. I have this in a big pot because you need\na lot of surface to toss it. I also have some creamy smooth peanut butter. You need some granulated sugar, this is some\nlight corn syrup, you can use honey if you want to. I've got some vanilla extract and you're also\ngoing to need some dark chocolate chips and some butterscotch chocolate chips which I\nhave in the back because there's not a ton of room here. Alright, so let's get started and like I said\nif you don't want to use light corn syrup you can use honey if you want to, the only\ndifference is that honey is going to give you a bit of a floraly after taste, delicious,\nbut I really want the pure peanut butter chocolate and butterscotch to come through and I don't\nwant anything to disturb that so that's why I'm using light corn syrup. So, in the saucepan I'm going to add the sugar\nand the corn syrup, and keep in mind that this is by no means something that you should\nmake often, it's a total treat once in a blue moon you can make this but like I said it's\na very sweet, very indulgent, and it uses ingredients that I don't usually use on a\nnormal basis, so worth the splurge! I'm going to bring this to a simmer, just\nwant to cook it long enough for the sugar to dissolve and then I'll show you the next\nstep. Once you bring it to a simmer and it comes\nup to a boil, you don't want to boil this for a long time you just want to turn this\noff because the sugar is just about dissolved at this point, you turn that baby off, and\nyou're going to add your peanut butter. Let me switch to a spatula because it's a\nlittle bit easier to get the peanut butter out, now this is not the time to use the all\nnatural peanut butter because it will split and it will be a disaster, so just add smooth\npeanut butter right in carefully because you do have boiling sugar and you want to make\nsure that you don't splash it on yourself so add that right in along with a splash of\ngood quality vanilla extract and now all you're going to do is stir this together until the\npeanut butter kind of is melted and it's harmonious and it's smooth and wonderful in that corn\nsyrup mixture, and as you can see it's happening it doesn't take very long at all, you just\nneed to be patient and just stir. Then just pour this, make sure you're using\na heat proof spatula if you are going to use a spatula. Pour that right in - ah smells so good! And then you just mix, you want to - this\nis why I like to use a big pot - because I like to make sure that I mix it really well\nand if I'm using a bowl and it's not big enough, then everything goes everywhere. Alright, once you have everything pretty thoroughly\nmixed, you're going to just dump the whole shabang into a 9 by 13 inch baking dish that\nyou've lined with parchment paper and you've sprayed with non-stick spray. You can use coconut oil if you want to, this\njust helps things not stick - got it out! Alright and now what I'm doing now is I'm\njust using my spatula, and I'm just kind of moving things around to make sure everything's\neven then just kind of pushing down on everything to compact this a little bit and then what\nI'm going to do next is I'm going to just mix together the chocolate chips, the bittersweet\nchocolate and the buttersweet - my goodness can I just get a sentence out without complicating\nthings? - Butterscotch chips and the other chocolate\nchips - melt them together, badda bing meet me back here to smear it. There you go! Alright, my chocolate chips are almost melted,\nat the very last second I just kind of like to mix it all in myself and just melt the\nrest of those chips just with the residual heat just so I know I'm not burning my chocolate,\nnow I'm using bittersweet chocolate and butterscotch chips because the butterscotch obviously is\ntraditional in a scotcharoo - but most people like to use a milk chocolate or a semi-sweet\nbut I think there's so much sweetness going on that you need a little bit of dark chocolate\njust to kind of offset that and that's why I like to use dark chocolate and the butterscotch. And then you just pour this gorgeous rather\nbeautiful shiny lava like mixture on top and then just smooth it out. Just get it nice and smooth from one corner\nto the other, kind of get it in as even as you can get it because it's kind of important,\nand now it's important that you just kind of let this cool and set before you cut into\nthem, so I'm just going to set them aside until I'm ready for them which will be in\na couple of hours and then we will cut and serve! Alright, my scotcharoos have set now for a\ncouple of hours, don't mind me that I can't cut straight, it's just the story of my life\nbut it doesn't really matter because these smell so good and they're so mmm! That butterscotch smell with the chocolate,\nI love life! Mmm! There's no words, not too sweet, perfect,\nperfect balance of peanut butter to butterscotch, slightly crumbly not too too dense, but absolutely\nperfection! Ugh! Why do I keep looking at it like it's going\nto do something magnificent?

I'll see you next time, bye!", "iMjuxivGb5U": "[Music] hello my little pickles granny here and today we've got four cereals to try doesn't that sound fun well the first one is frosted krispies alright

them because they're so good who doesn't love cookies and cream there's very delicious let me know what your favorite treat is I might bring them to you so yeah the ingredients you need iron ice krispies mini marshmallow crush all those that are crush in a in a food processor but if you don't have a poop a food processor just put it in a ziploc bag and just mash it down like if you would like if you want to hit somebody just hit it there also I have butter and vanilla extra as I have a pan here on low on low heat and I'm going to add the butter and you're going to let the bottom mount on low make sure you don't let the butter burn so I'll show you what to the next add butter half melt and I'm now going to add my marshmallows still on low you're gonna melt those marshmallows in the meantime take your rice krispies and your oils and mix them together now that my marshmallow has melted I'm going to add the vanilla extra and you're going to start this is going to make the marshmallow this is going to make this treat taste so good this makes everything together and you will add the rice krispies and the oil and try to work fast I turn the heat off of course and mixing this want to work a fast as you can because this stick see I have a nine by nine square pane and that's where I'm going to put my mind crispy crispy treats so guys I finish put put in mine my crispy right here what I've been doing is with my hand flatten things out but we're going to leave the here in the counter like for for about one hour until each set and I'm inch back when they're ready to serve I let my oil rice crispy set for one hour and they should come out this the scorpion very easily because we sprayed them so then how they look how it look I'm going to cut them now you can cut them however you want them in half and each half I'm going to cut them again I'm telling you guys that this is dangerous here around my house just put them together oh my god this is getting away so

might bring them to you I hope you enjoyed the recipe and you see next time", "8ll3f_VntGA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "3DDK6Sb5ipw": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with chocolate energy bars that's right have you ever had low energy so you went and bought one of those energy bars which helped except now you're low money because you just pay three bucks for a couple ounces of fruit nuts and of course low money can lead to low self-esteem which of course leads to low energy and we're right back where we started well hopefully this video helps break that cycle because as you're about to see it's pretty fast easy and inexpensive to make your own energy bars so let's go ahead and get started with what is basically the secret to this whole operation the dates and not just any dates we're using what's called medjool dates which not only have a beautiful sweet flavor but they're also nice and moist which provides the perfect amount of stickiness with which to hold all our other ingredients together and what we need to do to prep these is simply pull out that pit in the middle which is very easy we just have to break them open and pull them out and then once our data is seated we'll just give it a little rough chop to make it blend a little easier and that's it and by the way on the blog post I will go over a little bit on what to do if you can't find the medjool date you do have some options but having said that they are pretty easy to find try to look for the grocery stores that have lots of hybrids in the parking lot they will usually carry them but anyway we'll go through our dates removing that seed or pit or whatever it is and like I said give them a little rough chop which may or may not be unnecessary but I do it anyway and once we have a couple cups of those dates prepped we can move on to mixing this up with the rest of the ingredients which by the way we really want to do in a food processor so into that let's go ahead and dump our raw cashews as well as some almonds which by the way I did toast first generally if this was being made by your typical vegan from central casting this would be done with all raw ingredients but I do prefer the flavour of the roasted almonds and quite frankly I don't see who I'm hurting by toasting those of course I'm sure someone will let me know but anyway after that we'll also add some coconut and not the sweetened one just pure coconut look at the label it should just say coconut and then of course we will add in our chopped dates as well as since we're making these chocolate energy bars a lot of cocoa and hopefully it's a very high-quality Dutch process cocoa and I will let you know in the post the exact brand I used but using it a nice chocolate here is kind of a key and then since these hour energy bars we're done you want a little bit of fat so I'm going to go ahead and add in a couple tablespoons of coconut oil which if you haven't worked with it before it looks like this at room temperature it sort of looks like shortening but looks are deceiving this stuff's like a hundred times better for you to use this will just zap it in the microwave for a few seconds until it melts into this liquid form and we'll go ahead and pour that into our mixture and not only is that going to provide us with some energy that fats going to combine with that cocoa to make this all a little more chocolatey so we'll toss in some coconut oil followed by a little bit of an L extract definitely the real stuff in fact if you knew where the artificial stuff came from you definitely wouldn't use it but anyway a little touch of vanilla followed by a tablespoon of liquid to help this all come together and most people like to use water but I'm actually going to use some cold espresso which will serve the same purpose except this is going to make that chocolate taste a little chocolaty ER and then we will finish off with a little pinch of salt and that is going to be it for our chocolate energy by our ingredients so at this point we can head to the food processor to mix this up whoops hold on I forgot something we can't do an energy bar without a little pinch of cayenne so that was a good catch we almost ruined it and now that we finally have all the ingredients in for sure we will head over and process this until it just sort of comes together into one mass and as usual we always want to pulse on enough to start and by the way I should mention I like mine kind of chunky I like to see and feel lots of pieces of the nuts but if you want your smoother you can always process the nuts first and then add the rest of the ingredients in after that so that's up to you but I do prefer mine chunky so what I like to do is pulse it out not for about a minute and then evaluate well take off the lid we'll give it a little mix with a spatula okay first of all we want to make sure there's nothing weird going on and there wasn't but we also want to check for moisture okay if it seems a little dry you can always add a little more water or coffee but mine seemed pretty good so I popped the lid back on and continued and please keep in mind like most of these videos I'm hopefully teaching you a technique here that you'll then adapt using the ingredients you want ok literally any kind of dried fruits nuts seeds can go in this so there's just a ton of room for experimentation here but anyway we're going to keep processing that until like I said it kind of comes together in one mass which is what I have right here and once that's happened all we need to do now is transfer this into some kind of plastic wrapped mold and by mold I mean any kind of pan or casserole dish so we'll go ahead and transfer that in and use our spatula to press that down nice and even and by the way don't worry about trying to get it absolutely perfect here with the spatula just get it close because the next step here we're going to put a piece of plastic over the top and then we'll use our hands on top of that to get this all nice and even and smooth out the best we can and that my friends is pretty much it except for one major thing before we try to cut this we want to chill this thoroughly in the fridge so it gets nice and firm okay it's all about significantly slowing down those molecules so let's go ahead and wrap that up and pop that in the fridge for two or three hours or until like I said it gets firm enough to cut so this is mine later that afternoon and I'm going to go ahead and pull that out of the pan it should feel firmer and significantly less sticky and once we have that unwrapped with a smoother side up all we need to do is cut this into whatever size bars we want so we could cut this into sort of a small snack size or what you see me doing here which is more of a meal replacement portion but really that's up to you you are the boss of your bars which reminds me you can also be the boss of your balls since instead of molding this in a pan you can just take the mixture and roll it into balls which is kind of a cool way to serve them in fact once form you can roll the balls in cocoa or coconut and they'll kind of look like truffles but anyway I'm going for the more traditional bar shape and then once those are cut you can just store them in a ziplock bag I like to keep them in the fridge but you don't have to or if you want to get a little bit fancy and by fancy I mean crafty we can just take a little square of parchment paper and sort of wrap it up in that and then we can hold all that in place with a piece of butchers twine and of course I could have done that a lot neater and made it look a lot more perfect but I wasn't going for a professional look I wanted this to look rustic and homemade allegedly but anyway just an idea for you I think it's kind of a cool way to package them it's going to keep them nice and fresh plus because these things are kind of sticky it's a nice easy way to handle them but anyway no matter how you package these I believe you're going to be enjoying an energy bar that's just as good tasting less expensive and probably better for you all right our dates and cashews here provide just enough and I really think you're going to be surprised how chocolaty this is which is a good thing because this really does look like a fudge brownie which I guess could be one of the issues with these because while it looks like a fudge brownie of course it's not going to taste like a fudge brownie but that aside I think this compares very very favorably to any similar type fruit nut bar you're going to get at the store and as you saw if you have a food processor these are very very easy to make so I really do hope you give these a try soon head over to food wishes comm for all the agreement amounts and more fo as usual and as always enjoy", "PxQfeZ4A7_c": "hey-yah I'm April McKinney and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make my no-bake peanut butter Otis if you have watched many of my videos or if you've been to my website you will see that I love peanut butter I use it in a lot of recipes I especially love peanut butter and chocolate Reese's Cups anything like that it's my favorite kind of deserved candy delicious love peanut butter and chocolate together but right now I'm just using peanut butter I'm a huge fan like I said and this recipe is so quick it's no bake you know I try to squeeze in workouts and nap times and things like that nowadays and I actually just did one and so I need something quick and easy that I can just grab you know so I can go feed maverick or do whatever I've got to do and this is perfect for that and I'm telling you you can make it in like five minutes it's so easy so let's get started but the first thing I have is some natural peanut butter now this is not the stur kind nothing wrong with the stir cod but you really probably don't want to use it for this recipe because it's a little too runny this is actually a natural Jif peanut butter it's like one of my favorites alright so get that in there next is some honey and the sweetness with honey and I'm gonna add a half cup of it this is my little trick this is what I did with the peanut butter honey you know it's really sticky and so when you measure it out it sticks to the measuring cup so what I like to do is just take some cooking spray and spray it on my little measuring here and then I'll just go ahead and pour in 1/2 cup of honey and you can make these you know if you don't want quite so much honey you don't have to use so much but it's you know it needs quite a bit we're adding a lot of oats to this I'm using peanut butter that doesn't have you know added sugar in it so this is the only way this is going to get sweet and I'm telling you kids are going to just go crazy over these bars and they're gonna be good for them so it's great alright so I've got my honey in there's some space here and the next thing I'm going to be using is some coconut oil and I'm using two tables of coconut oil you can just get this with a regular grocery store where the other oils are if you don't have coconut oil or you don't want to use coconut oil you could use butter or you could use some type of canola oil you know any kind of oil worked we're just needing something to kind of give this some moistness but coconut oils really good for you so I would recommend getting some and you can use it to cook with and it's really good in place of butter if you're trying to cut out butter in a lot of recipes so give coconut oil a try alright let's put the top of my honey here and you can add salt the peanut butter that I use that natural Jeff it actually has some salt already in it so I'm not going to have any but if you're using just a completely you know organic all-natural all it has is peanut butter in it peanut butter then you can add you know a couple pinches of salt because it really brings out that sweetness what I'm going to do now is I'm just gonna pop this in the microwave for about 30 seconds to a minute just until the coconut oil melts and we can just kind of mix it together here we go this is the cooking part of this recipe alrighty so it is done and I put it in there for like I said about a minute and you can see it's sort of loosened up all that honey and everything is just melted together with the peanut butter so I'm just going to stir this a little bit perfect consistency YUM you could just eat that by the spoonful in that I'm gonna fit in my toilet these are old fashioned oats I'm using 3 and a half cups some but you can go ahead and get these in here and just stir it all together until all those are nice and did okay you are almost done with this I've got to start up really well all the oats are coated in the peanut butter goodness so what I'm gonna do this show them that I could not make something with peanut butter then it's like an oat bar type thing without adding something mix in I was kind of just do dried cranberries for this but I didn't have a full third of a cup so I added some chocolate chips and I've got some semi-sweet chocolate chips in here use dark chocolate chips and that's going to be better for you than using like a milk chocolate less sugar it's the darker the better for this and so I'm just gonna stir in a third of a cup of mixed in so I'm using a combo of dried cranberries and chocolate chips you could use all cranberries you could use raisins you can do just chocolate chips whatever you want to do or you could do no mix-ins at all if you don't have the ingredients in anything extra don't worry about it just just do the peanut butter in the oats and you'll be good to go nice and stirred up so you're going to get a little bit of the chewiness or chocolate enos and every bite all right if I have here a 9-inch dish and what I've done is just lined it with some regular aluminum foil and you just want to press it in and this way we're not gonna dirty up this dish and we can just pull this out and then cut up the bar so it just makes it really easy and I'm all about easier right now so what I'm gonna do is just put my oat mixture right into the dish there all right now if you're using chocolate chips and you put them in like I did it right after it's come out of the microwave then you melt a little bit which I'm totally fine with it just means a little bit of melted chocolate going through out your bars which hey I don't know any that would complain about that so now I'm gonna do is just press this in and you really want to press it in pretty well what I like to do with this kind of thing when it's kind of sticky like this and everything off the spatula is I actually just put my fingers under the some water some cold water so I just did that and it makes it easy it makes it not stick to your hand so much just want to get it really nice and compact in this dish all right so I've got this really nice and pressed down here so what I'm going to do it's still kind of warm so if I tried to cut them now they may not stick together really well I'm gonna pop it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and it's gonna chill then I'll show you what they look like they're so good doesn't leave me licking my fingers here peanut butter chocolate hose my favorite snacks okay so the oat bars have had time to chill for a little bit and they are ready to be cut into squares so this is really cool just this is why I do this why I didn't get an aluminum foil thing people like I do is just pull it right out and didn't even dirty up this dish so that's really convenient so now let's just cut it into squares no way to try it you'll see how easily this cuts up and perfect and you can see how well they stay together here just like so easy I mean literally this took I mean no time to make and they stick together so it's just like the easiest you know levar you've ever made in your life tons of protein tons of fiber like I said great pre-workout post-workout snack and for me with breast feeding right now I'm hungry a lot so I need things like this that I can grab that are gonna be good for me and satisfying and that's exactly what this is so I hope you give these a try make sure to check out on my website if we're making any comment if you like this recipe you want to see more videos you just click on my face right

that's so easy it's almost not even a recipe its chocolate cherry clusters and the base of these crunchy delights corn flakes you could use I suppose if you wanted to like a puffed rice cereal or something like that or even granola today I'm going with the cornflakes crush them just a little bit with your hands this is three cups to that add half a cup of dried cherries golden raisins would be good or even dried cranberries if you wanted to your choice but the combination of cherry and chocolate is one of my faves there's your base over here I have 2/3 of a cup of chocolate I'm using a total of 10 ounces of chocolate but I have melted over a double boiler 2/3 of a cup and I have the remaining chocolate here that's just chopped add your remaining chocolate to the 2/3 of a cup and what you're doing here is we're sort of simulating tempering which is what makes chocolate so nice and shiny on professional candies and things like that by melting some of the chocolate and getting it hot and then cooling it down with the remaining chocolate generally speaking this works pretty well it's not perfect perfect all the time but it's a lot faster and easier than classic tempering just keep stirring it until the chocolate melts if your chocolate isn't quite hot enough to melt the unmelted chocolate you could always return it to the heat for just a second or two the chocolate should just gently melt into the already melted chocolate and when you toss it with your cornflakes or whatever you're making your clusters out of as it cools it should set really nicely even at room temperature this looks good so now you can just combine everything add your chocolate to your corn flake mixture this is hard huh once in a while I like doing stuff like this it's just fun it's yummy kids can help with this it's win win win win win stir everything together make sure that all your cornflakes have chocolate coating them the chocolate is not there just for flavor but it also holds these clusters together make sure they're nicely coated okay I just want to drop them in cluster sizes whatever size clusters you want onto parchment lined baking sheets so my clusters are about a tablespoon you can do a little tiny mini ones if you want to they don't hold together super well in the beginning but obviously as they set the chocolate will harden and then they'll hold together this will make about 24 1 tablespoon clusters and then different sizes will make different amounts you just need to let them set in a cool room temperature for about an hour before you eat them they're set they lift off they have formed clusters I'm not going to lie with a little nervous for a sec even though I knew it was going to work mmm little hints of brightness and the cherries crunchy chocolate coated fun these are so easy so delicious you're going to love them they're the perfect little tree", "KbJJRd_5aqc": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to crafty cake shop on youtube today we're going to be making some rice crispy treats using the rice krispie treat mold some rice krispies treats in the 0.78 ounce which fits perfectly inside the mold some paint brushes and some lollipop sticks that we'll be using to put inside a rice crispy treat a plate to use for painting our poppy paint on we'll be using poppy paint in the color blush and also poppy paint in the color buttercup we have color mill in the color tiffany and lavender some merkin's chocolate in white and we're going to be using this small rose mold here two silicone cups in the one cup size some sweeter polita sprinkles and we have some completely edible glitter here a cookie scribe also this cookie scribe i made we're going to use this to make a hole inside the top of our rice krispie treat [Music] and some ribbon just to tie up our rice krispies treat when we're all done get started making our rice krispies treats to start off with we're going to melt down our merkin's white and our silicone cups and we're going to put it in the microwave at 30 second intervals [Music] so i have this in the microwave three times at 30 second intervals we don't want our chocolate too thick or too thin so this is the consistency that we are looking for [Music] all right let's color our chocolate using color mill and tiffany and lavender we're going to start off with a couple drops and we're going to make sure to stir it well [Music] [Music] pro tip so if your rice krispie treat is too thick you can flatten it out by just pressing it down with your hands let me also point out here that 99 of my videos that i post are for promo purposes only i do not resell so this is why i don't wear gloves however you should wear gloves if you plan on reselling or feeding this to anybody now we're going to pour our melted chocolate into each cavity of our mold and we're going to tap it just to make sure that all the chocolate gets in each corner of the mold [Music] now that we're done with that part we're going to go ahead and add all our rice krispies treats making sure that they're nicely centered inside our mold now that we're done we're going to go ahead and throw this in the freezer for about five minutes the reason why i put it in the freezer is so that the rice crispy treat doesn't rise up when i'm putting my chocolate on top all right so now we took it out of the freezer we're going to pour the rest of our chocolate on top [Music] and just a heads up i did use a pound of chocolate for this video i was able to get six complete rice krispies treats out of this and i had a little left over to make my two roses that went on top of my rice krispie treats that you'll see at the end of this video so once we're done filling all the cavities with all the chocolate we're going to go ahead and pop it in the freezer for about five minutes and we're gonna tap it just to release all the air bubbles all right now we're taking this out of the freezer it's been in the freezer for about five minutes and we're going to gently pull back the silicone mold to release each rice krispie treat [Music] oh it's so pretty [Music] i'm gonna torch the top of my chocolate and apply edible glitter if you don't have a torch that's totally fine if you had some leftover chocolate you can drizzle some chocolate on yours or create a cute design on top or even spray some edible glitter it's just not going to stick very well [Music] and again i'm using my torch i'm using it just to warm up the tip of my cookie scrub if you don't have a torch you can use hot water and what i'm gonna do is make a hole on the top of my rice krispies treat so that i can insert the stick [Music] contour poppy paint we're gonna pour some poppy paint in the dish that we had and we're gonna grab a brush and dip it inside our paint and gently tap on top so that some of the paint that's on the brush will end up on your chocolate [Music] [Music] now we're going to torch our rice krispie treats this is going to soften up the chocolate so we can add sprinkles on again if you don't have a torch you can do a drizzle with chocolate and then apply your sprinkles onto that and i wanted to show you guys how i packaged my rice krispies treats i'm using a 4x6 bag i will link all the products that i use today in our description box so make sure to check that out these bags are available at craftycakeshop.com

to my kitchen today we're going to be making a recipe that is loved by pretty much every single person on the planet we're going to be making rice krispie treats I am gonna put a little bit of my own twist on it and let me tell you what the ingredients are gonna be you will need the Kellogg's Rice Krispies you will also need cocoa pebbles you will need some marshmallows I have the jet puffed one 1/3 cup of butter and then you'll need a measuring cup and a pan - later treats in and then you're gonna use a pot on the stove what I really love about making this recipe is the fact that you don't have to turn your up and on and it's super fast so if you have a party or a potluck to go to this is a trick you can bring and you're gonna look like a pro and everyone's gonna love you for bringing it so let's get started okay let's get started by adding the ingredients and prepping them for the stove so I'm going to measure 3 cups of the regular Rice Krispies [Music] okay and then I'm gonna go ahead and measure three cups of these whoops which are spilling halfway for some reason some cereal boxes when you open them they just don't pour the cereal out correctly pour that on top of their puddle about one more cup in here I don't know about you guys but I love cocoa pebbles I got that in there okay so I'm going to turn it on to a low heat because you're gonna be melting butter and marshmallows and let me tell you this is something you do not want to burn if you burn it it tends to mess up the recipe just a little bit all right so I'm gonna let that butter melt a little I'm gonna grab my marshmallows and a lot of recipes will say five and a half cups of marshmallows another recipe will say an entire ten ounce bag of marshmallows it can vary between that I promise you if you put in a couple more marshmallows the marshmallow police won't be after you so do not walk away from this if you walk away and you burn your marshmallows this treat does not taste as good and I've learned that based on my own experience because we're not cooking you know roasted marshmallows on the campfire so you're gonna have them on a low heat and the more you stir you will start to see the marshmallows getting hot and starting to melt so stay nearby and watch it come together all right as you can see the marshmallows are melting really well with the butter and you're gonna melt it until you don't see any individual marshmallows that's the way I'd like to do it anyways make sure your temperature stays low once this is all melted down you're gonna start adding in your cocoa pebbles with rice krispies and this has to be a pretty fast process so notice how I'm smash kind of smashing the marshmallows that are left whole it's helping it melt faster all right so I'm gonna turn the heat off and try to show you how I do this take your bowl of mixed cereal this happens quickly you want to try to coat everything you're gonna make a little bit of a mess but they're anything like me but you can always clean that up later and you want to try to get all the cereal coated this smells amazing right now just to let you know and we're coating coating coating folding this stuff starts to harden quickly so you gotta have a little bit of muscles here coating it coating on coding it all right so that looks pretty coated I'm gonna do a little switcheroo I'm gonna scoot us over all right so because that happens so quickly you literally have to have a pan ready and you're gonna fold it all in its really hot but it hardens quickly because of that marshmallow all right so sometimes people will say that you can butter the top of a spoon to smash I'm going to show you an easier trick oh yeah yeah okay let me wash my hands real quick and let me show you what I do okay so some experts will say put some butter on the spoon and you can flatten it out I've discovered something a little bit easier than that in my opinion I have clean hands I'm gonna take a tad of butter rub it on my hands I know it sounds silly and I'm gonna just form this all right so we are smashing it smashing and smashing it with the butter on our hands and we're gonna let this cool for a little bit before I cut it and show you guys but cut delicious that looks all right I'll see you in a minute all right so we are all done with our rice krispie treats / kokapetl treats and they turned out perfect just make sure you guys pull them 20 to 30 minutes or if you're in a super rush you can go ahead and put them in the refrigerator and then you'll be able to cut them one thing you want to do is cut them with a serrated knife because that helps separate them and I hope you guys enjoy it I hope you take it to your next little party or shindig or a potluck and I promise you everyone's gonna ask you what the recipe is and how you were able to do it not knowing it's extremely simple so let me know what you guys think let me know if you use the same recipe or a different one and I hope you guys all have a wonderful day peace out", "YPbqqozAouQ": "hi it's jandy autry here's what's happening in the one minute kitchen [Music] let's just call it nutella nirvana shall we because that's what

General Store and I don't remember seeing them at the promo armor I'm sure they have some work they are only 90 calories each and I love pretty pelvis yeah so that makes them are really cool a low-calorie treat if they're any good they are marshmallow cereal squares they're looking for I think they're like a rice krispy kreme in Kitty's nice crystals they used three cups yeah it's big it feels big we're not even on like I said it's look at more small trees oh my gosh yeah it's just like that except it has fruit oh very pretty it is very colorful very powerful look at the icing on top don't see why it says hey there's a Warner Brothers thing on the back mmm looks like a tin fritters hmm no free Bella's I like the flavor mmm I don't like their insistent thing and I don't like chewing on a sponge hmm I do like it it's that wipers excellent the flavor is very very pretty very strong clever hmm don't taste the marshmallow them it reminds me just of I haven't had fruit loops and years so this reminds me of fruit loops cereal like if you took a lot of them and you squash them all together and then you eat them all at once he reminds me of $40 I know but I've ever had for any pound balls that taste is just just like for you they are fruity pebbles so that's what it is like they're fruitier than a dozen I would like them if they're they're stronger than four bucks okay yeah they're stronger the only I don't like I guess of the texture is kind of kind of dense and kind of like a spongy like it is but you get eight bar older you get eight bars of the box and so I think that's a good deal for two dollars hmm hmm yeah I really like those I'm surprised that I like this because I thought you know that we would get them and review them and it would be something that I was like Kevin have and I wouldn't touch them so much but now only things - I really like this so if you see these I would definitely recommend rum and your kids would bright like them too so I thanks for watching", "CXzenHJjrRQ": "hi I'm Alex and this is my recipe for crispy rice cereal chocolate cheesecake it's a mouthful of a title so I have been wanting to do a video using rice krispies treats in a new way for so long because they're actually malleable and you can make them into different shapes which means you can do just about anything I also am pretty obsessed with cheesecake as you guys may already know so I decided to pair the two together so because the flavor of rice krispies treats marshmallows I decided to lean into the chocolate cheesecake because it'll kind of bring together a s'mores flavor which is a classic I use the measuring cup but you can also just go in there with your hands to press it down into the springform pan originally for some reason I thought you could bake rice krispies treats and you can't I wanted to do a classic baked cheesecake so the first time I made this I made the rice crispy crust I poured in the Cheesecake batter I put it in the oven and then disaster struck so I ended up burning the original crust in the oven so I realized that I had to go back to the drawing board but actually it was easy to fix because I could just make a no-bake cheesecake so cheesecake lovers may argue that the only real kind of cheesecake is a baked cheesecake but you can yield similar results by making a no-bake cheesecake and it is a little bit easier to do so in a big cheesecake the eggs are gonna stabilize it whereas anomic cheesecake you have to use a different stabilizing agent so a gelatin or in my case I use the chocolate and whipped cream so in order to make the crust out of rice krispie treats you have to make sure you're working pickly because they're only malleable when they're still warm those are really the only key things to remember for this recipe other than that it's a pretty simple cheesecake just a lot more fun now once you make the cheesecake and you cool it you can stop there but I decided to decorate it because I really wanted to go the extra mile so if you're eating this by yourself feel free to stop here but because I was bringing this to a party I decided to go the extra mile and decorate the top I know this recipe is so sweet I'm not telling you to eat it every day but you know for a treat for a crispy treat it was a winner I'm not the best decorator but I really tried to focus here and make sure I nailed it we only had one shot now if you're concerned that your rice krispy will get too hot while you're cooling the cheesecake once the cheesecake is set pull it out and leave it on the counter for a few minutes and your rice krispies treats off and right up and there you have it snap crackle pop is that like trademark they can't trademark word right yeah [Music]", "7DZzh2iSG_I": "okay guys I'm going to show you this tutorial on how I did my rice krispies treats I promised you guys that I will get it to you before today's in and I trying to keep my promise so what I used here is a this is a soap mold and I ordered it from Amazon I have to find the link I'm not sure if I still got it I have it but if I do I'll put it in the link but anyway so what I did was excuse me to me in order to get my hole in there I'll put a little slit right here you want it you don't want to slit it all the way to the crease because if you do your chocolate a lip leaked out so after I cut it I took this little hole puncher just a very inexpensive probably at the dollar store hole puncher and I went in there and I punched a hole in there so now what you want to do before you punch your home and be very very careful because this this silicon is very very very delicate so I just I just tore this a little bit trying to show you how to do it but anyway once you get your hole punched in it well before you get your hole punched in there you want to measure this with the with the ruler this is a 2 by 3 cavity and you want to Center it so when you put your your straw in there it'll be centered so let me show you how I did it you want to take your bag of your chocolate and first let me open up this rice krispies treats also I just use store-bought Rice Krispies nothing fancy and so what I do is I kind of mash them down just mash them down a little bit so they won't stick out and once you get a mash down you want to put a little dam in there so you can put your stick in there once you get it once you put your chocolate in so your stick will hold in there okay so we want to take our chocolate and we're gonna fill in the bottom of our oh shoot hold on guys I think my chocolate is getting hard here let me put it in microwave real real quick okay I think it's gonna be okay so you want to fill it with your chocolate get into your corners don't fill it all the way up okay and once you get it in there you want to kind of shake it then you're gonna let your Rice Krispie Treat in there you're gonna get your straw and you're gonna put that straw in that little hole that we just made and we're gonna lay it in there okay and once we lay it trying to try not to let it go all the way to the top because it'll be a little bit bulky but even if you do get it a little bulky we can still cut it down no problem so go back put your chocolate in fill it up I think I got a hole in my bag out though you might see some chocolate coming out of here that ain't supposed to come across been kind of rough with this little bag you want to fill it in okay and then once you fill it in you just want to tap it pack it and make sure before you start working with your with your mo you want to put it on a cookie sheet because this mold is so flimsy you can't pick the mold up after you put your chocolate in there so once you get this feel you want to stick it in the freezer and you don't want to keep it in this freezer very long because if you do it'll crack so I have one here already made so once you up you're ready to take it out be very very careful just kind of pull the sides loose here just pull it loose and then push your treat up through there okay so now I've got a little bit of chocolate over the mou it was a little excess so what you do if you get a little excess in there you take a little paring knife and just slide that knife across there and you can even that up and watch it stand up how's that okay now here's one that I already pre-made and this was just something I played with just to show you guys you can decorate them any way you want to this was just a pattern that I had left from another job and what I did was I took the bottom of the of the mold and I traced it around to get this size now if you guys are good and savvy on the computer you can go on a computer and size your your photos up this is an edible image so if you go on a computer and do it you want to make it a two and a half by three and a half you want to have that little extra so you can cut off and then it will fit your respiratory treatment okay all righty guys if you have any questions let me know I hope this helped you guys bye-bye", "ARYvpcabC6c": "I've had a lot of requests for these recently so I thought I'd do a quick little video on showing you how to make this classic lunchbox tree that's also great for kids birthday parties let's make some beautiful marshmallow bubble bars on the one pot chef to get started I've got 200 grams of white marshmallows and to that I'm gonna add in a hundred grams of butter now all we're gonna do is I've just chopped up this buffer into little pieces and we're gonna pop this into the microwave on HIGH for about a minute and give it a stir every 30 seconds until everything's nice and smooth if you don't have a microwave you can just chuck this into a saucepan on a low heat and just gently melt it together it'll take a little longer but it will work just as well next into a large mixing bowl I've got five cups or about 225 grams of puffed rice cereal so that's rice bubbles or rice krispies depending on where you come from and all we're gonna do is pour in melted marshmallow mixture and carefully stir it all together to make sure all the rice bubbles are coated in the marshmallow mixture next I've got a large rectangular dish which I've just lined with some non-stick baking paper making sure you've got some paper on each side to lift it out afterwards otherwise it all stick to the tray so we're just going to pour that rice bubble mixture in and just gently press the mixture down so it's nice and even and smooth on top just being careful not to crush the rice bubbles too much next I'm going to drizzle over some melted white chocolate now I'm only using a little bit of chocolate here probably about 50 grams roughly just enough to put a little bit of chocolate on top not too much because this is already fairly epically sweet and scatter over some candy coated chocolate buttons something like some mini M&Ms would be perfect and this can go into the fridge for about two hours or until everything is chilled and set once chilled and set all we need to do is chop them up into little if you're making these for a party you can just pop them onto a plate no worries if however you're using these as lunchbox treats I recommend wrapping each individual bar up in a little bit of plastic wrap just to make absolutely sure that they stay nice and fresh and keep them in the fridge until they're required and here we have our completed homemade LCMS or marshmallow bubble bars or whatever you happen to call them they're looking absolutely gorgeous they're so pretty and crunchy and colorful and I guarantee these will go over big at your next kid's birthday party or as an occasional lunchbox tree how gorgeous do these look they are so simple to put together and I cannot wait to dive in mmm crunchy and sweet hmm a little burst of chocolate and go of that well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos up one pot chef show calm and until next time see you later you can easily change this up you could use milk chocolate or dark chocolate instead of the white chocolate you can replace the chocolate penes on top with pretty much any candy you like seriously come up with your own combinations and trust me the kids will go nuts", "PGslswBhrgQ": "happy st. Patrick's Day hope you are having an amazing day so today we are going to be making two different recipes and they're both going to involve Lucky Charms okay one of them doesn't use as much Lucky Charms but you will be excited for both so first we're going to be making Lucky Charms cereal bars so it's basically like a rice krispies treat only it's easy luck charms because they have green balls and marshmallows so let's go ahead and get started alright guys so we're gonna go ahead and get started and we're gonna put 1 cup of butter and alright so we're gonna go ahead and put that on a low heat just to kinda get that melted and then we're going to go ahead and measure 6 cups of mini marshmallows just kind of loosely just Ruth we want to just kind of continuously stir this so that doesn't burn on the bottom and just kind of make sure they'll just slowly start to melt here mmm melted marshmallows all right so we're gonna go ahead and add the Lucky Charms now that everything is melted go ahead and turn off the heat and you want to add about six cups all righty and just mix that up okay now that everything's melted and you have a wonderful slew of colors you're gonna go ahead and put it into I have a glass pan here we're gonna go ahead and throw this in here oh the rainbow colors yes beautiful so sticky all right so go ahead just kind of pack it all down get it all in there are them all the marshmallow goodness yeah all right perfect so just kind of spread it evenly throughout the pan ah all right all right so we're gonna let this set for probably about an hour just so everything kind of sets in place and then we're gonna dip it in white chocolate which makes it delicious and gives it that little extra flavor and I'll be right back all right guys so I want the rice krispies treats just set for about an hour and now all you're gonna do is I melted some white chocolate chips and I'm gonna dip the bottom in it and then kind of let the excess chocolate drip off okay and so I have over here alright so as you can see I kind of have stopped a few started I just put parchment paper on a baking sheet that way it just doesn't stick to the tray and we're just gonna finish it off these putting chocolate on the bottom and then once you have them set they're probably gonna take about ten minutes for the chocolate to cool and you can go ahead and take them off and then they'll be ready to eat all right and now for the recipe I'm most excited about let's go ahead and make the infamous share mark shape so I have some vanilla bean ice cream here and you can want to take about three scoops of this using an ice I don't have an ice-cream scoop but I'm just gonna use a spoon and I'm gonna put it into my blender here three big scoops cuz we want this to be berry ice cream like I don't even know that oh my gosh you guys I'm pretty sure it's been like 10 years since I've had a shamrock shake like you know the one you get at McDonald's or something like that but anytime you put ice cream and mint with each other I'm not going to like it because I love those flavors all right you want a cup of milk pick your flavor of milk whatever kind you want you're just gonna need one cup oh snap okay that never happened all right now that we've cleaned up that mess we're gonna go ahead and you're gonna want to put in just a teaspoon a couple drops you don't want is to be too minty you don't want it to taste like toothpaste but you want it to be delicious and then of course you need green food coloring because it's named Patrick's Day really green you can just get the droplets I just have this gel icing because I do so we're just getting is that all right let's throw this baby on the blender neutral chick-chick chick-chick chick-chick training guys so find yourself a girl a mug you can call a mug and try not to make a mess we're gonna go ahead and pour this baby into here gently sloped beautifully maybe a chunky give her a good shape get yourself some delicious whipped cream tap her off those if on the whipped cream and I have taken some of the marshmallows out of the Lucky Charms cereal and oh my gosh you guys this one has a boo-boo on top cuz I don't have a cherry but I just kind of place these marshmallows right on the side there make it look all cute got free booze and all the beautifulness the hearts alright and last thing we need to top this one off is a straw okay so isn't she gorgeous alright hmm it's good all right that is it for the shamrock shake I don't have anything else to say about it it's delicious try it it's so good", "dHW7RfOQi_c": "that means good morning in persian or farsi i have a bunch of cool some brand new some not so new breakfast cereal bars here three of them i've tried the rest i haven't tried and i'm very excited to try every single one of them and see which one comes out on top number one let's get to it rice krispies cookies and cream squares well okay here's the bar a lot of cookie bits and pieces on top and a white cream base at the bottom oh this smells so good it smells of white uh sweet cream why do you say white it smells of sweet cream smells really [Music] good it's very sweet definitely on the chewy side has a great cream flavor and those cookie bits and pieces do have flavor and they look you can have it has a really good cookies and cream flavor to it i'm gonna put it um towards the very beginning of the line right here so that's two thumbs up presidents choice dipped and chewy s'mores bars here's the bar nothing much to see there's the inside of the bar there's some bits and pieces in there that's the granola it smells like sweet cream and that's a really good scent it's very chocolatey in flavor i'm not sure if i get any s'mores though s'mores supposed to have marshmallows marshmallows are typically vanilla flavored not really getting that it's very sweet really chocolaty for now i'm going to put it somewhere in the middle because i didn't really taste marshmallows and really s'mores i'm going to give it two thumbs sideways golden grams treats s'mores bars here's the bar filled with chocolate and marshmallow bits and pieces on top and chocolate covered at the bottom it smells like sweetened chocolatey graham crackers i get a lot of sweet chocolate graham cracker flavor with a hint of vanilla so i'm gonna switch places with uh the president's choice bar here put this one to second for now golden graham's extremely sweet but tasty two thumbs up tim horton's double chocolate covered granola bar here it is very simple nothing to see here's the inside of it you can kind of sort of see the granola bits and pieces it smells like tea leaves and a lot of cocoa it also tastes like sea leaves and a lot of cocoa very chewy it's not too chewy even for a granola bar i'm gonna leave it towards the end of the line right now giving this one two thumbs sideways it's the reese's puffs bar or in canada grease puffs bar here's the bar really quickly you can see the peanut butter and the chocolate on top it smells of a lot of peanut butter and some chocolate the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor half an amount of chocolate flavor perfect amount of chewiness i'm kind of hesitant about this i know definitely definitely i want to put it above golden grams not sure if i'm gonna put it above the rice krispies cookies and cream or not but for now i'm gonna leave it second place tim horton's salted caramel chewy granola bar here's the bar literally falling apart as we speak you can see the salted caramel drizzle on it it smells very sweet and of caramel it tastes very sweet i do taste the salted caramel which is good it's very dry and too chewy i'm gonna leave it second to last for now it was definitely better than the double chocolate covered tim hortons granola bar in terms of the flavor and the texture rice krispies birthday cake squares here's the bar at the top a lot of beautiful colorful confetti pieces and white cream at the bottom has the perfect birthday cake scent to it smells very sweet and creamy wow it's subtle but it's really good tastes just like birthday cake i'm gonna have to think about this a little bit and see where i'm gonna place this and who's gonna be first all right from seventh place to fourth place let's take a quick look again it's the devil chocolate covered tim hortons granola bar at seventh place it's the salted caramel tim hortons granola bar at sixth place it's the president's choice dipped and chewy s'mores bar at fifth place and it's the golden graham treats s'mores bar at fourth place third place goes to the reese puffs bars second place goes to the rice krispies cookies and cream bar and by process of elimination you already know the first place goes to the rice krispies birthday cake squares have you guys tried all of these if you have please let me know in the comments what is your opinion on any of these that you've tried do you agree with my selection here or do you have your own let me know in your comments who do you think is the best choice of all the ones you've tried thanks for watching this video and check out this playlist i'll see you in the next video [Music] you", "yB-UMRupG48": "well hello cereal nation i'm papa swag i'm ben and together we are 79 and on this channel we talk about cereal and anything related cereal if that sounds interesting to you subscribe well ben i'm pretty excited about today's episode we are not doing one but two little boxes of cereal bars whatever bars cereal bars not the kind of bars you go to even though i think it'd be a great restaurant i've heard that they have them where it's actually a cereal bar where you go up to the counter and you can order what kind of cereal you want froot loops it's a real thing really what papa swag swag you swaggy are you going to finish your sentence or what where are they driving there's one i think in new york i think there's one in california and they're in texas of course in the big state of course texas but um there are cereal restaurants out there maybe one yep maybe we'll open our own here right here in columbus ohio maybe so but instead of having our own cereal bar we're gonna try some cereal bars not bars but actual bars not bars like in jail but bars not bars like at the bar but yeah bars like bars that are like candy bars oh maybe maybe these would taste like candy bars but cereal flavor that's what we're hoping for oh so i noticed ben i'm looking at the back of the bar only 100 calories yup and also in spanish on the spanish side it's also 100. that's i'm glad yep so the spanish one says 100 and the english size is 100. this is cinnamon toast crunch cereal bar this is honey nut cheerios cereal bar yup so let's go ahead and open up the boxes all right and try this through now i have some milk today so i can do a couple of different things with them with it then stuck with the water i will always stick with water ah what a board one day you'll be like pop a swag roll into the swagging that flagging person that i became the swag i don't need your swag i got my own swag okay you just said oh cinnamon toast crunch i'm putting that on my plate and i'm also going to grab my honey nut cherries bar me too look at these pretty packages that they come in pre-packaged very quarantined safe very quarantined safe i like that yeah very much so which one do you want to try first well i've already had seven toast crunch one before breaking news i've never had either one of these so trying the cereal bar for the first time is pop as well we should do honey nut first since i've never had that one so i'm going okay so let's go ahead and open them up all right they actually smell pretty good ben oh they smell really good i like the cereal oh my gosh that's got a delicious smell to it it's so good you can see the hot look at that you get a good picture of that you can see the honey caked into the cereal bar maybe it sticks together i've got a wonderful flavor to it but i'm going to bet you this is going to add something i want some put some milk there you're dipping the milk oh yeah oh mama oh pop a swag are you right over there yeah good stuff that's good i think it's good just the way it is yeah but that milk adding i'm gonna finish this me too these are really good they even got little honey nuts inside the bar in case you know because you notice that they have the little little honey nuts in there yeah yeah it's really delicious so a really good snack only 100 calories per bar hold on it is 17 carbs these are 17 grams of carbs and they only have less than one gram of dietary fiber it has nine grams of sugar yep let's see only three and a half total fat so that's not terrible you're gonna grate it give it a one to ten or no i'll give that at eight i was gonna give it an eight well we can do the same thing i guess we're a green so we're green tonight so that's a strange thing stranger things that's a good show i've never seen it well netflix we got it it's a wonderful comedy and it's got a lot of 80s themes to it because it takes place in the 80s i should have known it'd take place in the 80s 80s was a wonderful time i know according to you all right ben let's go do the cinnamon toast i'm actually going to drink some milk so this box doesn't say new but this one is does say new so maybe this one just came i think that one just came out they're both um both by general mills yep both of these are general most products oh yeah so i'm really looking forward to the cinnamon toast crunch because it has cinnamon in it oh yeah and cinnamon is delicious and i can imagine in a in a bar like form right it's gonna be so good so i'm opening up the bar you got to smell it oh yeah oh my goodness oh it's got that like apple strudel kind of smell to it oh apple strudel whatever it has it's like uh apple cinnamon smell kind of yes oh my gosh these bars are really good they're probably not good for you but they're really good only 100 calories so you can see it kicked in there as you saw on the camera the cinnamon just kind of kicked in there really good this is not as dry as the honeymoon cheerios bar i think it's a little better it's got that cinnamon sugar mmm if you like apple pie this is delicious i don't think you like apple pie i don't like pie he said you are an american just because i'm american doesn't mean i got like certain foods it's true back in the 80s there was a commercial of course it's the 80s all right let me hear it okay good um let me say i remember it baseball hot dogs apple pie and chevrolet they're all american yeah you're you don't remember that do you of course not you weren't here in the evening here in the 80s but it was a bit it looked in the late 70s and early 80s but that was the commercial we all sing baseball hot dogs apple pie in chevrolet the great american way so i might dip some milk in here oh yeah let me know what you think with the milk yeah it adds flavor to it what a what a wonderful idea to take great cereal products and put them into another form genius this is good for people who don't like milk and they want cereal that is true so what we just discovered was it does contain milk but you can't taste the milk so we don't like milk if you're allergic i'm sorry to hear but it has milk in this so you won't be able to have it well as almond milk and soy milk not dairy milk this is almonds then comma milk and soy ingredients oh so maybe i'm tripping contains wheat is it the milk and soy ingredients so it's not it's not gluten free you expect something like that to be gluten free well all the general most products are gluten free now oh really but most of them are is this one gluten free though no i think so this is just delicious delicious nice little energy bar i guess it could be energy bar yeah only 100 calories probably the worst hundred calories you'll ever have but all right so on that one ben i'll give that one a nine out of ten that was just delicious the cinnamon toast crunch adding the milk added a lot of flavor to it i don't know what your favorite beverages i'm sure if i was a coffee drinker i think that the would you dip it in coffee i'm not a coffee drinker but i think you might not want to do it in coffee but it'd be good to have oh with coffee with coffee because i think a lot of people that are coffee drinker if you're a coffee drinker i definitely recommend the cinnamon toast crunch um barb i think this one's not as dry as the honey nut cherries but both of them are very delicious very enjoyable i'd like to hear you the viewer if you had any one of these bars what your thoughts were this was our my first time trying apparently spoiler alert ben's already had the cinnamon toast crunch but i've never had either one of them and they were very enjoyable nice little quick snack in the middle of your day maybe to pick you up the door and work maybe your midday snack or your morning snack either thank you for your midnight snacks for your midnight snacks they fit into any kind of schedule the one they really do i give cinnamon toast crunch a seven the reason being is i'm not very big on sweets and this one is way sweeter than the honey nut cheerio one so if you like sweets i suggest you get cinnamon toast crunch if you're not big sweets honey nut cherries are the way to go i also think ben's got a big apple pie and i think it might have some apple flavor in there somewhere it might have some apple flavor in there uh well truth be told i never had apple pie you don't know what you're missing you need to go back to the 80s and know that apple pie was as american as red white and blue time machine for me not yet but we do have to film back to the future when we have to take you back oh to the future fantastic movie that's a it's a great movie um so any other comments ben about these two certain bars there's more than just these two but these are the first two that we had so we might be doing more episodes maybe not we'll see well i do know that there's also cinnamon toast crunch ice cream and lucky charms ice cream there's also on the side you can see some other lucky charms golden graham and then this one has reese's so there's a lot of cereal bars out there and uh we'll have to try some of these other ones later on in some

super excited to make just feels fun we are going to make some high-protein rice krispies treats so these are very easy and simple you only need a few things for this recipe let's get started well I'm going to use today because I had laying them had these laying around the house are the Cocoa Krispies brown rice cereal you guys can obviously use any type of puffed rice cereal or rice krispies whatever you like I'm going to try this out with the chocolate ones today and for my protein I'm gonna use the peanut butter fluff but you can use any mts way flavor that you like I think it'll turn out just fine and I'm actually not going to use marshmallows for rice krispies treats I know that sounds crazy but stay with me all you can do it what we're going to use for the mixture is some peanut butter and I'm going to use some agave nectar if you don't have a ghave nectar lying around you can use honey it's basically the same type of ingredient if you don't have honey laying around you could use maple syrup as well so that's really it we're going to get started first thing I'm going to do is take a bowl and I've got my half cup of peanut butter fluff whey protein measured out go ahead and throw that into the bowl and then for this recipe you're going to want to do 4 cups of the puffed rice cereal or whatever you like to use I guess that I'm using the chocolate so we had this laying around so 4 cups of that right into your protein now mix that all together next thing we're going to do is just you're going to want to have a pot on the stove and we are going to melt some hold together 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of the agave mmm good combination right there all right let's get this stirred up all right so I've got the half cup of agave nectar in here in the half cup of peanut butter this shouldn't take too long so you're going to want to keep an eye on it we're going to let this heat you want the peanut butter to get all nice and melty where it mixes in smoothly so I'm just going to stay right here by the stove and keep stirring it around until it's all heated up I've got an 8x8 pan here you can do nine by 13 whatever you have on hand if you don't have where you spray it down rice krispies treats are very sticky I've got some wax paper I'm just going to place that right in there with rice krispies treats it's crucial time is the essence so what we're going to do when that's completely heated up and a pull it off the stove and we've got to kind of mix it all together very quickly that's key because you don't want the mixture to cool down so you've got it you got to move on this okay you got to mix it all up and then get it in your pan very quickly all right now shut the stove off you can see this is all melted up now we're gonna act quickly we're gonna pour it all into our rice krispies next year I'm going to add it a little bit slowly kind of mix it up it's gonna be a little bit hot but you want to start to get it all mixed up make it a mess use my hands for this part here alright make sure you wash your hands show this is key and are going to be a little bit thicker since I used an 8 by 8 inch pan but I'm definitely going to lose some of this on my hands alright so I've got all the ingredients in my little pan here now and I'm using a spoon to just kind of push it down nice and evenly like I said I'm using an 8 by 8 inch pan so mine are going to be a little bit thicker which is alright we've already started sampling how it tastes flavor is on point chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats come on now it doesn't get much better than that so these are high-protein well you know they're fairly low in fat um this is an easy way to get them a nice little dessert in so what I'm going to do is go ahead and see how they look I'm going to put these in the fridge and let them chill overnight and then cut them into bars um but I'm going to let them cool overnight before I go ahead and cut them so pretty simple that took me what like 5-10 minutes max to get those bad boys right cut them up have a pre-workout post-workout delicious the rice krispies treats how fun is that come on you know those are just so good macros will be posted below on these bad boys if you like them please give them a thumbs up get away from your haters quit giving it a thumbs down like my videos go subscribe to my

articles\u00a0\u00a0 and plenty of photos all right let's get this\u00a0\nrecipe started for this recipe we need 1/4 cup\u00a0\u00a0 of butter 6 cups of mini marshmallows 6 cups of\u00a0\ncrispy rice cereal some kind of chocolates I went\u00a0\u00a0 with red white and blue it took me three stores\u00a0\nto finally find a package of red white and blue\u00a0\u00a0 they wind up being caramel so I want the actual\u00a0\nchocolate chocolate so I bought a regular bag\u00a0\u00a0 of the candies and then separated them that's 2\u00a0\ncups we need 1 cup of white chocolate chips and\u00a0\u00a0 then we need some candy melts I found this new\u00a0\nproduct instead of buying the bigger ones these\u00a0\u00a0 are mini ones and you can actually microwave\u00a0\nright in the pouch so I'm excited to try those\u00a0\u00a0 out today I have this list of ingredients on\u00a0\ndebsdays.com I've added a direct link in the\u00a0\u00a0 description right below this video we're gonna\u00a0\nmelt our butter in a big glass bowl microwave\u00a0\u00a0 that for about a minute until it's melted nothing\u00a0\nlike learning something new but last time I made\u00a0\u00a0 this recipe it took me a minute to get my\u00a0\nbutter melted here's what I've got after 30\u00a0\u00a0 seconds so I'm just going to thirty seconds\u00a0\nso be sure to check your butter within that\u00a0\u00a0 one minute because it may be ready before that\u00a0\nalright what we need to do now is to add the\u00a0\u00a0 marshmallows and then we're gonna stick this in\u00a0\nthe microwave for three minutes but after every\u00a0\u00a0 minute we'll stop stir and then put it back in so\u00a0\na minute stir a minute stir until they're melted\u00a0\u00a0 here's what we have after a minute doesn't look\u00a0\nlike much but as soon as I start stirring I can\u00a0\u00a0 see we've got some melting going on get that\u00a0\nbutter incorporated in there too so this is\u00a0\u00a0 after one minute and obviously my new powerful\u00a0\nmicrowave isn't going to take three minutes so\u00a0\u00a0 again we'll keep an eye on what you have in the\u00a0\nmicrowave if yours has more power of course you\u00a0\u00a0 won't have things in there as long I'm going to\u00a0\nstick that back in for another minute and after\u00a0\u00a0 two minutes I think we're good I'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nget that all well incorporated yep I don't need\u00a0\u00a0 that third minute awesome now I need to go ahead\u00a0\nand add my crispy rice cereal to that get that\u00a0\u00a0 incorporated I'm gonna add a little bit at a time\u00a0\nit just makes it easier because I don't have that\u00a0\u00a0 big of a bowl if you have a bigger glass bowl go\u00a0\nfor it but this is the biggest I have I have all\u00a0\u00a0 those stirred in looks like every one of those\u00a0\npieces is coated with marshmallow I'm gonna let\u00a0\u00a0 that cool for just a minute while I'm doing that\u00a0\nI'm gonna go ahead and butter my 9 by 13 pan I\u00a0\u00a0 don't know about you but I just usually take my\u00a0\ncube of butter open it up and start a spreading\u00a0\u00a0 now that the pan's been buttered we're gonna add\u00a0\nour candies and we're going to incorporate them since this week is the fourth of July I went with\u00a0\nthe red white and blue but you can certainly use\u00a0\u00a0 any color you'd like those look pretty well mixed\u00a0\nin there time to spread them into the pan okay get\u00a0\u00a0 those spread into the pan then we need to let this\u00a0\ncool before we do our next steps with the rest of\u00a0\u00a0 our chocolates my husband let me know I did not\u00a0\nflatten that properly so I'm gonna go ahead and\u00a0\u00a0 butter my fingers and then press it in by hand\u00a0\nall right those are cooled next step we need to\u00a0\u00a0 melt our white chocolate chips I'm putting them in\u00a0\na bowl and I'm gonna stick them in the microwave\u00a0\u00a0 about a minute I'm gonna stir them about every\u00a0\n20 seconds until they're melted we're in a minute\u00a0\u00a0 here looks like we're well melted get that all\u00a0\nstirred together well and then we're gonna take\u00a0\u00a0 this I'm going to spread the chocolate right over\u00a0\nthe top I'm gonna go ahead and get this finished\u00a0\u00a0 and I'll be back in a little bit I'm gonna go\u00a0\nahead and let that cool and then we'll be back to\u00a0\u00a0 use our melts in a little bit I'm gonna go ahead\u00a0\nand use my new candy melts if you use these be\u00a0\u00a0 sure to read the directions on the back of the\u00a0\npackaging it's in pretty small print I'm gonna\u00a0\u00a0 go off and get those melted and I will be back\u00a0\nI followed the directions I'm ready to try these\u00a0\u00a0 out you can make swirls dots since it's fourth of\u00a0\nJuly I'm in an attempt to make a star I would say\u00a0\u00a0 if you're using these mouths make sure you cut a\u00a0\nvery small hole obviously the one I cut that was\u00a0\u00a0 the little dotted line here was just too big for\u00a0\nmy purposes so warning cut a small hole not a big\u00a0\u00a0 one like that not the prettiest thing but actually\u00a0\nit's pretty easy we're gonna let that cool and\u00a0\u00a0 then we'll be back to cut those and looky there\u00a0\nthey turned out prettier than I thought yummy", "g_qKpLGpmgM": "Like

be royalty chief I don't taste a difference is that the common consensus or am i a freak trees everywhere there are so many trees one two three four five we can conclude there are at least five trees thanks to Mars rover and mr. yeast we've got ourselves a little bit of a problem team trees was too successful and we now have too many trees has anyone ever tried to eat a tree what can we possibly do with this abundance of trees has anybody tried eating a tree what if we could eat the trees I don't really know what probably you can eat as a piece of bark Jewish crackers let's try to figure out what we can use trees for to help reduce the massive growing population I was doing a little bit of research and I came across this mean how much sawdust can you put in a rice krispies treat before people notice memes are supposed to be jokes but this is no joke to me how much sawdust can you put in a rice krispy before people notice I've enlisted the help of fellow YouTube scientists idubbbz to help me discover the answer to this question ladies and gentlemen welcome to an extremely scientific video real science we're going to the store right now we're on our way to Walmart to you okay yeah sorry about that I was eating a donut do you know how to make rice krispies it's goo you get goop yeah and you get sugar sugar egg goo I mean well it's not marshmallow sir I don't actually know what marshmallows I think it's animal I've taken a science class or two in my day and the second most important part of an experiment is research don't worry about the first part I'll get to that in a second whether it's using the internet going to a library or reading the back of a cereal box you want to gain some information before you begin developing the question you're trying to answer rice krispies consists of three main ingredients rice krispies goo and butter how do I know this because on the back of every box of rice krispies is a recipe for rice krispies treats that is the power of research the number one most important part of a science experiment is the poster board you can't do science without a poster board you idiot how much sawdust can you put in a rice krispies treat before people notice the purpose of the experiment is recycling sawdust to save the environment and to make Rice Krispies cheaper our hypothesis is 50% of the rice krispies can be replaced with sawdust variables our sawdust krispies rice and your taste buds slash flavor will do 10 30 50 that's the plan we're gonna make rice krispie treats with these ratios 0% sawdust 15% sawdust 30% sawdust 50% sawdust and 100% sawdust at what point will someone be able to tell that their rice krispies treat has ground-up tree bones 1.5 tablespoons of butter did you wash your hands no all right how much rice krispies I would say go with two and a half cups of crispy under the mochi at heads definite control 0% sawdust 100% rice crispies but William what kind of sadhus are you gonna use that isn't gonna kill people I bought the good stuff on Amazon and it comes with a datasheet have you ever bought flour that came with a datasheet and it is 100% safe to eat here I'll show you right where it says that goes it down here I feel like it'd be right next to the inhalation warning so don't inhale it I guess ingestion because it's not dangerous to eat that means its safety it's not edible its eatable it says to like not get it aerosolized oh really wood flour has this super fine consistency it feels like regular flour but a little bit more like like less fine not quite as fine as regular flour oh look look at how it's doing like some crazy static thing yeah you see that yeah I do one of these mommy finger tricks that's gross don't say that ever you know just mix it mix it mix it you know that honestly does not look that bad was it that easy that's easy let's see if we know I hear something no human hair did you wash your hands no in are you ready for science yeah I'm ready Freddy 0% sawdust 15:33 50 and 100 they clearly look different and I know they're gonna taste different but the most surprising part is how different they were structurally 15% you notice it's a little bit harder it feels dense they're like if I try pressing it it can withstand more force when you squeeze the 15% it's not moving as easily so the 0% sawdust was exactly what you'd expect a rice krispies treat to be and the hundred percent sawdust was a brick now this this was just a little monkey turd I saw that is you could probably build a house out of sawdust and marshmallows you could kill somebody with a brick of this stuff it is so hard and as you go between zero and a hundred percent you have like varying degrees of hardness I think the rice krispies are going to become increasingly difficult to eat not just because of their flavor but because of how hard that this is what a rice krispy tastes like honestly if someone told me sawdust was in there already I believe 15% sawdust this is like the first time we're eating sonocent yeah no idea no way I have literally no idea there's sawdust in here that's amazing it's just it's just like it's a not great Rice Krispies chief I think with a little bit more marshmallows it's like a little softer you could actually get me to eat a whole tray of these as you get toward the end of it you create some sort of wood glue in your mouth you can smell it actually does kind of smell like sauce 33% you know the interesting thing about it is sawdust like I mean I guess disappointing the experiments ah this doesn't taste like much No so as you're chewing through it it's like yeah this is tough I wonder what they did this is like your grandma is from another country she like made a dessert but she's also a little senile and you just eat it okay when you're at the end when you start breathing air and they're like coming out but it just tastes like a kind of weird foreign dessert I could finish this out of courtesy welcome to 50% sawdust really fast you couldn't eat this you couldn't like the textures off I can feel it binding on my teeth I'm swallowing it because I want to see what my poop and scoop it oh my god yeah it gets harder the more you chew on it has a flavor to it - that's a weird part like a caramel it kind of I'm swallowing at 33 to get in my boat Ian and I have been a little bit too involved in the creation of this experiment so let's go find some different victims come over here before we test our next victims let's hear a word from our sponsor who without their support we would not have been able to afford the rice krispies and marshmallow this video was sponsored by audible and audible help save trees by delivering books over the Internet if you want to kill electrons instead of trees you should consider using audible my first introduction to audiobooks was a long road trip with my dad where we listen to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown it's kind of like national treasure accept less Nicolas Cage my 13 year old self strongly recommends The Da Vinci Code there's something kind of magical about an audiobook it's like a movie without the screen you still kind of get the experience of reading without having it like force-fed to you like a movie sometimes does the next audiobook I'm gonna listen to is the Hobbit the internet says it's better than the movie I watched the movie I didn't like it maybe I liked the book if you sign up for a free trial of audible you get one free audiobook and two free audible originals you can use the link audible.com/scishow m for your free

that's a table I started out not tasting funny and at the end of it it tastes funny like I licked my table saw please consume this Wow you ain't even the big leagues yet does this taste like one of those like Velveeta discs like those breakfast discs yeah subject please consume this it runs a lot tougher the last one was even more still it's like these are just kind of like differing levels of stillness that or either of your parents account is actually pretty close please consume this it's not awful this tastes like lard bars there's a lower bar I've never heard that is a good protein yeah and they're pretty good they're small they're about this big everyone's out of comparison to some food that they don't like like something that they actually sell for real money in a store the left pcs is there sugar marshmallow I'm freaking yeah it's like something your grandparents would have in their kitchen table oh there's nothing there's nothing it's like you grew a tree but instead of watering it with water you watered it with sugar water tastes like I ate a piece of crappy wood that's got like glue in it you know what glue tastes like rock I'll work with a little bat it's going okay this one's not so good okay yeah now show me a single rice krispies treat that bug this isn't a YouTube thing I've done it's like a word is original except just all wood and there's no caramel it's just wood which one tasted the best I do like any of them actually sorry you had to take another bite out of one of them right now which one you can take a bite out of sawdust at 15% sawdust only a botanist is going to realize that there's sawdust at 33% people will be hesitant to eat a lot of rice krispies but they will continue to eat them out of respect at 50% there is clearly something wrong and at 100% it's not even a rice krispies treat anymore", "DAeVxatKdQg": "hi friends it's jennifer with jennifer at home thank you so much for joining me today today we're going to make some rice cereal treats they happen to be my absolute favorite and i can't wait to show you how easy they are to make my favorite brand of rice cereal is the great value brand from walmart i also simply adore the great value mini marshmallows i've never once found one of those extra hard crunchy pieces and the great value cereal box the first thing we need to do is melt the butter and the marshmallows on low heat just keep stirring until they're completely incorporated the butter is melted and the marshmallows are starting to melt down as well once the marshmallows are completely melted we'll add a teaspoon of vanilla we'll turn the heat down to low or you can turn the heat off and then we'll add the six cups of rice cereal to the quarter cup of butter and the 10 ounces of marshmallows a teaspoon of vanilla and six cups of rice cereal at this point i'm going to turn the heat off and stir them in at this point they're completely mixed in once everything was completely incorporated i poured it out onto a sheet of wax paper you can also put it in a 9 by 13 butter dish i pressed it lightly with buttered hands into the shape of a rectangle and then i sprinkled on some green sugar for a christmassy look now the only thing left to do is just let the cereal treats set up then i'll slide a thin cutting board right underneath the wax paper and just cut them into squares i always store my cereal treats and zip top bags and the freezer you can also store them in the refrigerator for two to three days in a sealed container i hope you enjoyed this video i know you enjoy

another review for you here and today we're back at the capsule for an all kellogg cereal themed review two old favorites turned into cereal bars that's gonna be the frosted flakes and fruit loops cereal bars that were just introduced man these boxes bold colors it's like very nice it's like almost 3d these uh toucan sam and tony the tiger they're beautiful beautiful hd photography on their part but the cereal i've been looking forward to most this year is the chocolate chip cookie dough craving chocolate chip not cookie cookie dough themed cereal boy if you know that this exists and you're not interested i'm not sure ctc is for you because this is really outstanding look at the back ryan it has the museum of chocolate i mean there's like craved chocolate chip cookie dough security guards and museum goers and artists and all kinds of stuff this is just uh boy and the colors just go together so well this is just it's a very beautiful review um look lots of new cereals as with any new year i mean look on friday we just covered eight of them if you haven't checked out the lightning round yet you definitely should go back and do so but i do think that this is uh maybe even taking it to another level i want to start with the frosted flakes let's see how that cereal bar turned out first up is the frosted flakes cereal bars these were 2.49 at albertsons in fort worth and let me tell you they just look absolutely delicious it looks like a bowl of tiny sized frosted flakes with a base of milk frosting really really encouraged by how these look overall all right and cheers okay boy that frosted flakes flavor is bold yes bold bold bold and and unmistakable that is so frosted it also does kind of taste like milk yeah it's got a frosted flake in milk what happens to the milk when you pour the frosted flakes in it is that it takes on some of the sweetness by adding in this layer of frosting milk it really mimics the flavor that the milk makes when you pour it over the frosted flakes i'm very impressed i think texturally it's maybe even a little bit better than a bowl of frosted flakes because it maintains the crunchiness while still giving you that um that distinctive milky sweetness yeah so it's not soggy not soggy they do this they just they they know how to make a good bowl of frosted flakes in a in a bar i'll tell you let's see if they can do the same for froot loops and i think we hyped it up enough uh it's time to get into the froot loop cereal bars boy i cracked one open and it just smells like a delicious bowl of fruit you got really tiny fruit loops on this one it's even smaller than cheerios whereas froot loops are usually bigger than cheerios i also had noticed that on the frosted flakes one but i couldn't tell if it was just mashed up frosted flakes or if they made smaller frosted flakes so it looks like they made smaller frosted flakes and smaller fruit loops to put this bar together like with the frosted flakes there is that kind of milky sugary base so i found them for 2.49 at albertson's in fort worth and i am ready to try it out cheers ryan tell me if i'm going crazy it's way i might be going crazy i might we we've been at this for many many hours at this point so yes i might be um is it is it like really really really soft it's soggy your anticipation in that one is really nice yeah but like i like it like that it's suck it's not it it's soggy is just the word that comes to mind but not soggy i made a i had an hypothesis earlier with the frosted flakes one that maybe the the milky bottom the the sugar milky bottom wouldn't translate to a fruit loop that was incorrect i've been proven wrong because it's delicious it doesn't taste as close to a bowl of fruit loops as the frosted flakes taste to a bowl of frosted flakes so i guess you could say that that's a a con but i actually prefer this to a bowl of fruit loops because i just like the texture much better it's maintaining that fruity f-r-o-o-t-y taste for sure um if you love fruit loops i can't envision a world in which you don't love this i just can't but if there are things about fruit loops that you don't like i think this may kind of mitigate your risk factors enough that you can uh you can enjoy this uh i'm not a huge fruit loop fan i know that about you actually i love this ball and you do love it so i don't know uh two for two for sure but really i think where all the chips lie is in a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal so let's take a look at crave all right that brings us to the main event so uh kellogg's the pressure's on because chocolate chip cookie dough crave is next and uh the thing that i found kind of interesting is that they only put the chocolate chip flavor on the outside of one side not both sides it has like a grainy kind of texture and it's just very different from any other cereal of course it has that filled inside kind of like old hidden treasure cereal it doesn't taste specifically like chocolate chip cookie dough or really like chocolate chip at all i think really it tastes more like the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor that you add to a protein bar it's just it's not it's not like but it doesn't taste like a protein bar it just tastes like that like attempted additive of like a delicious flavor um but really the true test is going to be in milk so ryan you want to get an action shot perfect so now that we've milked it up here uh it looks like a poppy seed bagel on top on top of uh on top of some of these pieces let's see how this thing tastes i like it in milk it has some extra crunchiness but the problem is the word dough there's just nothing cookie dough about it and that's what made this particular cereal very special was that it was proclaiming to be cookie dough 3.99 at winn-dixie in metairie louisiana would i have bought it again yes i would have bought it 10 times but it's not chocolate chip cookie dough that's the unfortunate that's the unfortunate news as the cereal pieces get softer i enjoy the cereal more and more the out the outer level with the chocolate chip pieces is staying crunchy providing a good contrast and then inside it has additional chocolaty reinforcement so you're getting good chocolatey taste you're getting great texture it's a pretty well executed cereal except it doesn't deliver what the name implies so the gimmick grade um i'm gonna have to lump together both of the kellogg's cereal bars they're just their designs are identical just with slightly different colors and characters very bold designs i mean really they're more interesting than they should have been because it's just that's what great packaging will do and that's what i always celebrate and why a gimmick grade is very important because these are going to be well-remembered products that could have been forgotten if they end up going away or they're going to be you know long-standing shelf takers for a long time because people might be more willing to buy it than they would if it was just a boring old label they did a great job and for that they should be celebrated i'll give them a seven and a half out of ten gimmick grade which is about as high as these were going to get you know for making a cereal bar out of existing popular cereals the gimmick grade they are beautiful the size the square shape they're so crammed in ryan how long have i been proclaiming that small boxes are the way to go i've been just shouting it from the roof i'm pulling my hair out trying to never buy any family size boxes so yes putting them in small boxes did definitely add to the presentation and i'm sure that walmart if they get them we'll have them in 10 12 packs something like that instead of this nice convenient six-pack and it's going to make a difference and it's going to look a lot uglier but i'm judging what i have in front of me and i think it's very beautiful and really nice great great execution 10 out of 10 though for the most interesting gimmick of cereal for the year i love the idea of making a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal like i just can't express to you enough that i just never guessed that we'd ever have a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal now that's not factoring in the execution that's just the gimmick the box design is perfect the idea is ridiculous and memorable and that's what the gimmick grade is all about that might be the first 10 out of 10 gimmick rate of the whole year so uh well done to the folks at kellogg's crave for that getting into the capsule countdown as we're talking about taste as you guys may have guessed third place is going to the crave chocolate chip cookie dough cereal a brave attempt out of the box not all that interesting or tasty tasted more like a protein bar minus the health benefits which is never something that you want but in milk it was pretty darn good i really liked that it brought out two different textures just a really really solid taste so i'm still going to give it a 7 out of 10. third place on today's capsule countdown it could have been a lot worse look if it tasted like more like chocolate chip cookie dough to get a much higher grade and may have done better in the capsule countdown but it also may not have because it had two very stiff competitors second place is gonna go to the froot loops cereal bars ryan i see you nodding with a pretty adamant agreement which is um which is encouraging look it's better than a bowl of fruit loops i take it over a bowl of fruit loops any day that's about as high of a compliment as you can give a cereal bar right the texture is better and i just want to keep eating it you know it's just it's perfect it's it really is as good as it possibly could have been now that said for me about the ceiling of where this could have ended up was an eight and a half so i'm gonna go with an eight and a half and you know one a product that i wouldn't have necessarily thought that i was gonna continue eating after the lights went out here today but i will and it's it's very very good but i won't until i'm out of the frosted flakes cereal bars this one i don't even know where to where to start the texture is better the sweetness is literally perfect it's all of the best parts of the eating frosted flakes experience but elevate it a little bit it's easy it's quick it's convenient it's delicious yeah exactly i mean you can't have a bowl of frosted flakes when you're driving you know what i mean dennis reynolds dennis reynolds right i feel like i gotta give it a 10. like i'm trying to find a flaw in it and i really i just don't see a flaw and i mean when something is as perfect as it could possibly be it's really hard to not give it a 10. so i'm giving it a 10. and i don't see any i don't see any uh any disputes here from you ryan so that's true not they're on that challenge flag so that's uh that's pretty encouraging um yeah i mean for two dollars and fifty cents get yourself six portable breakfast bars that are really gonna i mean it if you like frosted flakes at all you're gonna love them you're just gonna love them probably love them more than frosted flakes i have a from the archives product for the ages for you guys today there's a cereal that exists i don't think any of us could have guessed [Laughter] this is the fred meyer z100 morning zoo flakes serial from 1990. ryan can you believe that a morning show dj cast of characters in portland got their own cereal that is amazing from a local grocery store chain now granted it's kroger owned i mean it's a big it's a big grocery store the backside has the jammin salmon's cross weird puzzle where you have to know things about the radio station its characters and the music that it plays i don't think anybody has ever completed this puzzle in human history this one is just one i was really glad to add to my collection there's an instagram account that actually subscribes to our youtube channel his name is serial stash i believe and um he reached out to me and asked me to check out his page and i actually kind of stole the idea of these from him because he posted a picture of one and i was like okay i'm buying those so i found it on ebay and ended up picking them up and it was one of the smarter purchases that i have ever made on the next volume there's no more cereals for one more for one week next week is an important one for our morning routines though because it's combining coca-cola with coffee it's all five flavors of the coca-cola with coffee line of energy drinks i don't know what do you call that soda coffee liquid carbonated liquid please come back on a monday for that and of course until next time i will miss you until i see you go and get yourself a 10. this stuff is good",

that's flat just get a spoon if you want that'll be make it easier to flatten now just set this aside and we'll get on to the next part get a microwave-safe bowl and throw in 250 grams of milk chocolate pop this in the microwave for 30 second bursts stirring after each time until it's melted now get the melted chocolate and pour it straight over the top just try and spread it out so it's fairly even just pop this in the fridge until the chocolate has hardened all right that is set now once you've taken it out like this leave it for about 5 to 10 minutes just to soften a little bit

still like don't even add milk to it just eat it out of the box as cereals go Cinnamon Toast Crunch is close to perfect it's a great miss not good for you but it's a really good delicious cereals

flavors of cereal treats here Golden Grahams s'mores Lucky Charms with that let serials that no I wish those Reese's Pieces cereal these are recent stops and last but certainly not least my favorite cereal ball times 72 is crunch which one of these treats would you like to try first Lucky Charms this is effing go with that I'm so surprised you picked marshmallows first show it to him No for those of you out there who never had these treats they're essentially rice krispies treats just maybe different cereal all of them have a little coating on the bottom though there are the softest things in the world but they have a nice chewy texture to them and this one actually is even better than you might expect because I am oh the worst part of Lucky Charms is the non marshmallow pieces they're pretty bland by themselves however these have all been coated in some kind of sugary film and it makes it now much more delicious good start here I'm gonna be Lucky Charms treats I'm eight out of ten we give it okay you give everything a five out of ten you doesn't really lighten up a little bit next up cinnamon toast crunch you don't send it to us crunches my favorite serie of all time however I think they did it kind of dirty here with the treats version I think one of the things that hurts it the most is that the cereal isn't crunchy I mean what I love the crust part I'm cinnamon toast crunch it's a decent amount of cinnamon flavor but I just do not think sitting toast crunch was translated well for this treat still not that bad but definitely panels comparison lucky charms I'm gonna give this one a 6 out of 10 next up going Rams s'mores one of my favorite cereals is post s'more it's essentially cocoa puffs Golden Grahams and marshmallows oh yeah so the idea of combining golden brown chocolate and a little tiny marshmallows with another layer of chocolate on the bottom pretty much a slam-dunk to me what do you think about this one really I like it a little bit more than Tam I think these are great I'm giving these a 9 out of 10 last but certainly not least Reese's puffs Reese's puffs is one of my favorite cereals let's see how it is in treat form there you go whoo there's a peanut butter drizzle on this one yeah this is pretty good although once again I don't feel like the tree version does the cereal justice sell a few better flavor though I'm gonna miss one oh seven out of ten now which one was your favorite Lucky Charms why am I not surprised do you love marshmallows tam prefers the Lucky Charms I prefer Golden Grahams s'mores treats these things are the bomb calm really do you mind any of these worth of purchase IMO I think you'll be happy with them but if you want a safe bet I say go with Lucky Charms or go around s'mores because marshmallows these marshmallows make everything better right yeah come on over you want to give it a shot things gonna work out too well she only has two teeth for now good effort [Music]", "5B3UB0kxJ1U": "hello everyone and welcome back to my channel in this video I'm going to show you how to make easy treats they're really easy and they're super cute for the kids for the first idea I'm gonna be making rice krispies treat and we're gonna begin by adding 6 tablespoons of butter once it's nice and melted we're gonna add 6 cups of marshmallows and I'm using the small ones keep mixing until it's nice and smooth like this and then we're gonna add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and when it's nice and smooth like this go ahead and remove it from the heat then we're gonna add 6 cups of rice krispies cereal now we're gonna mix it with the big spatula so it's easier until it's completely mixed now I'm going to transfer my mix to a baking tray and use your spatula to make it nice and even now I'm going to let it cool down for a little bit just don't leave it for too long or you will get hard and you need it manageable to cut your designs now I'm gonna make some bunnies with this cookie cutter and it's really easy just press down and when your mix is not too hard is really easy to cut them now I'm going to press down on the bottom because I want these bunnies to look like they're sitting down and here I have my bunny now I'm going to cover them with chocolate I'm using these candy melts I'm gonna use the purple and yellow I also have some coconut and popsicle sticks i melted my chocolate in the microwave and now I'm going to be adding some of the chocolate to the popsicle sticks so my popsicles can stay better and now I'm going to place them in the fridge so they can dry faster so I can cover them in chocolate I'm also gonna be making some in yellow color so I will be doing the same thing just placing the popsicle sticks now I'm going to cover them in chocolate but I'm just gonna be doing the front part of the bunny I don't like to cover them in chocolate completely because they will be to sleep and it's really easy to cover them in chocolate just use your spoon and just make sure that you lay it all the excess drip down so they can dry faster [Music] I also melted some white chocolate and I transfer it to a ziploc bag so I can make some bunny tails these are gonna look so cute I'm also going to add some coconut to make more fluffy and just let them dry and look at these bunnies they look so cute and for the second idea I'm going to be covering this mini pretzels in chocolate I'm going to use different colors I'm going to cover half of the pretzel first then let it dry once it's done drying I'm going to cover the rest now since the blue ones are dry I'm gonna go ahead and cover the rest I feel that they look a lot better when they're covered in chocolate completely and now with my white chocolate I'm gonna go ahead and drizzle some lines [Music] and for the last idea I'm gonna be covering these long pretzels in chocolate I have some sprinkles and I'm going to color my white chocolate in blue with his candy color this is from Wilton and I also have some orange chocolate and I have my chocolate already melted I melted in the microwave I color my white chocolate with candy colors and to dip them in chocolate it's really easy just get a cup that it's a little bit long that way you can cover as much as you can from the pretzel and just be really patient just lay it all the chocolate drip down and for these pretzels I'm also going to cover half and then once it's dry I'm going to cover the rest and for this blue ones I'm going to be adding some sprinkles and just make sure that you press them that way they can stay better [Music] and now they're dry I'm gonna go ahead and cover the rest [Music] and this is how my blue pretzels look I just love how they look when they're covered completely and now for my orange bread sauce I'm gonna go ahead and drizzle some lines and I'm gonna add some sprinkles so they can look even better and these are my Easter carrots and I'm going to place them individually in bags and you can find these bags at Michael's or Walmart and this is how my pretzels look I just love the way they came out I also place my bunnies in clear bags and I'm just going to put a ribbon so they can look even better and this is my three Easter ideas I hope you guys liked it and I made another video on how you can give this as a gift I will leave the link so you guys can go see it and see if you guys like that idea and I hope you guys like this video if you guys did don't forget to subscribe to my channel leave me a comment and I'll see you guys on my next video bye bye you", "RCxQcmFQlLo": "what about Nestle's cereal bars I love me some zero but are lost any good let's find out what's going on guys thanks of my elbow comes that is video it's time for our episode of the series what about that product and today we have something that I'm really excited about cereal bars next quick Chuck a pic and cinnamon ease which is basically like cinnamon toast crunch all three nestle products you know how big of a cereal friend actually a dict I am and I love trying new cereals but here in mogera we don't have that many varieties like for example you have there in America which I'm really jealous for and if anybody is up to send him some cereal from America or from anywhere that we don't have here just just right you know so we have had those cereal bars from a while here but a few Kevin tried any of them and this actually is going to be my pre-workout I'm not gonna get anything else I hope that this will give me enough energy for today squats so let's get started I'm think I'm gonna start with a choco cake so they are 25 gram bars and each bar cast 102 Cara sitting too close look at that guy's this looks amazing like for real it's like there's a chocolate glaze and underneath it has like a white chocolate or just like some kind coating so let's see how it breaks and look at this let's see how it is whoa this reminds me of something this tastes like KitKat snack bowls and tastes like that it tastes like paper or just cereal coat it in really really good Nestle chocolate and it does have a chocolate layer on top it's not just cereal now that's real good I'm going to try next week next same kind of bar the cereal a little bit of coating and underneath it has like white chocolate or watch I don't know so I'm expecting something similar they taste pretty similar though I think that chuck epic cat a Richard chocolate flavor and your head next week was a bit more sweet I think I prefer a chocolate cake the chocolate layer was much much better than this this tastes just like cereal and a bit more sweet I don't know I just feel like the chocolate was better and now to the cinema nice guys I'm not the biggest cinnamon fan but still I'm gonna give it a try okay this is a bit different it has like Rice Krispies and guess like little cinnamon squares a caramel coating and again white chocolate layer underneath so it smells really strong cinnamony I mean give me a second so if you like cinnamon like cinnamon toast crunch I can't say month-old I think no I have never had cinnamon toast crunch but if it like cinnamon II cereal because this is basically a cinnamon cereal you'll love this bar it tastes just like cereal with a really really nice caramel coating and the white chocolate definitely makes it taste better but for me this is just middle-of-the-road it's okay I mean it's a good bar I like it but it's not something that I would run to get yep I think the same goes for next week it was a really good bar but I don't think it's better than choc thick and choc a pic it's not in my favorite list but definitely is a very very good bar it's in the middle road of being good and does the this is the bomb you should try this bar definitely and that's quick it's a very good bar too but it's still middle role for me though I would go and get this bar again the cinnamon maybe maybe I would get if there's no next week or topic that's guys hope enjoy the video this was my weekly product review if you liked it make sure to give a like comment down below what you think which bar would you try and if you have tried one of them or all of them which is your favorite subscribe the channel and still makes one", "8h7bTMKxqsU": "for our bars you're gonna need about 8 cups of cinnamon toast crunch some dark chocolate to melt at the top why don't I have bags and mini marshmallows and five tablespoons of butter in a large pot we're gonna melt our butter over low heat once all of our butter has melted we're gonna take it off the heat and add our 1 and 1/2 bags of mini marshmallows [Music] mix all the marshmallows until they become a sauce and are fully incorporated into the butter once all of our marshmallows have melted we are going to pour it in our cereal stir in the cinnamon toast crunch and mix until it's completely coated with the melted marshmallow sauce line at 9 by 13 inch pan with parchment paper and we're going to pour our mixture into the prepared pan press the mixture into an even layer using your spatula if the marshmallows are sticking to your spatula you can always spray with cooking spray [Music] we're gonna drizzle ours with melted dark chocolate put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes and let it set if you're not using chocolate just let it sit out at room temperature for about 30 minutes enjoy guys", "Eq_BqoInAPs": "cookie dough flavored rice krispie [Music] treats hello everyone starting off with the cookie dough portion now this cookie dough is safe to eat because it doesn't use eggs but some people have concerns about raw flour and it is true that raw flour can sometimes contain e coli so what i did to mitigate that risk is i put the flour in the microwave and i heated it for about 40 seconds until it reached at least the temperature 160 degrees fahrenheit which according to the interwebs is enough to kill the bacteria in the flour that is in that bowl one and a quarter cups of flour so once you reach the right temperature it may feel compacted a little bit just give it a stir let it set until it cools now in a larger bowl place one third of a cup of butter quarter cup of white sugar half a cup of brown sugar you're gonna cream those things until they are nice and fluffy then we'll add one quarter cup of milk or cream a teaspoon of vanilla extract a quarter teaspoon of salt i blended that until smooth and then you're going to blend in that flour i just got the tail end of it because i didn't turn the camera on then finally stir in three quarters of a cup of miniature chocolate chips and that is your safe to eat cookie dough now we need rice krispies treats that's your basic rice krispie treat recipe which has marshmallows and a little bit of butter i do mine in the microwave i microwave the marshmallows for about two minutes until they are melted and puffy i add a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract give that a stir until the butter and the marshmallows are combined and then i add the rice krispie treats in i'll put the recipe amounts in the description box below if you're interested then we need to put this in a container this is a 9 by 13 inch baking dish that's been lightly greased put half of that still warm rice krispie treat mixture into the bottom of it and then spread it out and pat it down now some people say to grease up your hands with a little bit of butter so they don't stick to the rice krispies but the secret to this is just dampen your hands with a tiny bit of water and they will not stick at all it's a great tip then take your cookie dough and place it on top of the rice krispie treats i used two spoons to kind of spread this out because the rice krispies treats are still warm and you have to work with it while it's still warm otherwise it'll you won't be able to spread it out putting the cookie dough layer was a bit of a challenge but not that hard put it on there spread it out and then you're going to add rice krispie treats the second half on the top of your cookie dough layer and you're going to spread that out now this part is optional but i think it does add a nice little chocolate flavor to these i put some melted semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave until they were melted put them in a ziploc bag with a corner cut off and just drizzled a little decorative drizzle on top of the rice krispies treat layer these according to the recipe should be stored in the refrigerator however that makes the rice krispies treats harden up quite a bit so you may want to take them out and let them warm up a little bit before you serve them and here they are rice krispie treats with cookie dough in the middle now if you love cookie dough you're gonna love these the texture is a bit strange to have the rice crispy texture and then a really kind of a soft cookie dough texture in the center it's a strange texture combination but the flavors work very well together and they are very very good these should be eaten within a couple of days because as you know risky sweet treats have a tendency to get it kind of hard dry over time but i have a feeling that if you make these they may not last that long thanks for watching not surprisingly i have a playlist full of delicious rice crispy based yummy treats including these peanut butter cups stuffed rice krispies i have a lemon meringue one that looks like a watermelon and even oreo flavored go check them out", "5XLoWVrd83k": "today cannot really be trying the Lucky Charms treats these are marshmallow bars there are eight marshmallow

ago I don't think that little bugger oh they're mom they're all mushy than that it feels like a you know like a marshmallow rice krispies treat that's what they kind of feel a lot no particular did you ever wonder what the charm with the charms what power that gives him no you never wondered that from the Montaigne the heart allows lucky to bring things to life the star I won't read it on just gonna read a little bit the star gives lucky the power to fly the purple horseshoes gives him the power to speed things up the green clover can bring the luck the red balloon gives him the power to

the changing for all the time which one would you like out of those pregnant is I would like to time travel I would really like that that time travel would be good I'd rather be invisible I'd do all kinds of me the good things time travel would be good because you could you could find out the lottery numbers and then you could go back that's true and you could win the lot of course you could only do that so many times before the feds would be after you okay breathing that's true that would build prove anything but now I think that one would be cold so I'm sorry that we couldn't see our little Charlie no I gotta know where they've been the mix of marshal all that kind of God wish you what do you think of the flight they're good they're reminds me of a rice krispies treats if the cereals not rocks pursues it's just a different serial button you really don't get this strong like a marshmallow flavor but it's but yeah I agree it really is just like a rice grapefruit so if you've seen these in the store they're very sweet I think it's right snack for uh for only a hundred calories and I still like the golden brown ones better but yeah the golden gram bars are made by General Mills as well so all of those you get the Golden Grahams you get cinnamon toast crunch and those are awesome - I love those and they have these so usually I know a narwhal mark there on the very bottom shelf so I think a hundred calories great afternoon snack or something like that so thank you to Mitch Mitch force in disease I'm gonna have a picture for the end you're not going to be able to see the details like we said I hope you enjoyed it anyway and thanks for watching [Music]", "tk2duduKI20": "today's video I'm going to be making about chocolate treats it's basically the same as rice krispies treats because you can pretty much just use whatever cereal you want and make rice krispies treats or whatever Froot Loops treats but every Halloween I usually make Frankenberry treats but this year I thought I'd mix it up and do comp Chocula treats because chocolates usually better so I'm just gonna be making some Count Chocula treats all right so the first thing you do is you have to melt the butter so if you don't want to make rice krispies treats then you really don't [Music] also have to grease the pans before you put stuff in little fashion Crisco vegetable [Music] [Music] lay down all right melted butter I'm gonna put so there's some extra bag instruction on the back of the bag actually tell you to do it in a microwave here but just as messy so I don't wait to all the lumps are gone just because they don't have to get burned like there's like three lumps in there right now [Music] this is six I just make sure it's nicely coated and then into the pan filming that hardens all right so after about ten minutes I'm just gonna go ahead and cut them and put them on a plate make them beautiful so obviously these aren't sugar free or gluten free as far as I know they're lactose free I don't think there's any milk in these but you know you can find like a gluten-free sugar-free cereal and make these and all my gosh they are not cutting very well messy yeah okay disaster I'm gonna spray my knife and see if that works to the porridge double oil probably is good to put these in the fridge as well really let them garden okay a little bit here yes spring the knife it works for a second until you see till you admit that it works and then it stops working let's try it delicious so this is the finished product I am ended up having to put it in the fridge for a couple minutes because I mean it's melted marshmallows a sticky mess you can't really stack them on a plate make them pretty either cuz I mean they just you know they stick there so but that's it if you don't mind having sticky treats it's a good idea for Halloween", "dmJYEggh4Sw": "hey there guys thank you for coming back to my review channel for today's review we got some of this here count chocula

mostly healthy affordable family friendly recipes rich in nutrition and labor i'm diana Johnson and today we're making an edible craft easy vegan chocolate rice krispie treats [Music] but kids made these chocolate rice krispies treats last year for Easter and they have been begging to make them again this year Arden had surgery and was hospitalized until Easter day so we didn't actually get around to making them until this week of course they wanted to film it and even though I was once again filming with three kids somehow in my mind I saw this recipe video shoot going much smoother than the peanut butter protein balls shoot whipped it's gonna get crazy and real helps you get notifications when we post a new video and it helps us by telling the YouTube algorithm they should

someone or someone or for yourself cooking time is connecting time we printed the recipe at awesome eating rich lucam and I've got the link above and in the description below for you to be able to do the same the chocolate rice krispies treats themselves take just three ingredients Rice Krispies cereal chocolate chips and spray oil for greasing your cookie cutters weightless enjoy light bacon chocolate chips because they're dairy free I also got several bags of them in the discontinued bin at our Fred Meyer right now we're mostly having groceries delivered but if you are currently shopping stores in cursive make sure to always check those discs Bend's for items that you normally use that is a great way to save a few dollars on the food you're also going to need some candies for decorating your chocolate rice krispies treats we like to use the pull-apart Twizzlers for long straight pieces on with skittles and my connect candies the skittles are mostly for Eric just one taste for other supplies you will need parchment paper or wax paper and a cookie sheet a medium-sized bowl and fork a large bowl a spatula and a half cup measuring now it's time to crease those cookie cutters just gonna spray quick spray it on the inside of my cookie cutter I thought it would be really easy for the kids to spray their own cookie cutters but it looks actually more difficult than I thought and they ended up using most of my spray oil so fair warning it's up to you if you have your kids do this step or not now kleben's turn and then lick you might want to move biscuit and point--is spray down so it stays on the sheet scoot it back a little all right you're good you want help just rip it in it'll moisturize your hands measuring out ingredients is a great time to do some home schooling and work on fractions I try to do this every time we cook together and one day they'll really get it if we have 1/2 cup measurer how many do we need to get 1 and 1/2 cups if we cut an apple in half so how many have one yes if we want one and a half how many halves do we need it was super moisturizing plane ain't it big jump right to melt these I'm going to put them in the microwave at 50% power for 30 seconds I'll take it out and stir and then repeat 30 seconds at 50% power until it's about 90% melted if you don't want to microwave your chocolate you can melt it in a double boiler which is basically just a glass bowl sitting on top of a pot of simmering water on the stove just stir the chocolate continuously in the bowl until it's melted while the chocolate was melting we've got ready to measure the rice krispies it is cereal rice krispies our cereal they're just not very fuel food cereal wait did you hear that right at the end of the video that was the start of the craziness did you put your finger in there on accident or on purpose well I think you put it in on purpose but getting stuck was an accident yeah alright and I tried to pull it off and it didn't work did it yeah alright shall we try and boil it up oK we've tried string and we can't get it through to do that method so Corbin is holding it elevated with an ice pack I was sure this video was not gonna have anything crazy like the last it was actually easier when they were toddlers to fill the cooking videos with because autism he feels and processes pain a sudden injury like flunking his head can't lead to a quick big cry that he's also quickly over if you help them calm down but women rarely communicates ongoing pain so if he keeps crying about something hurting we know that it's pretty bad [Music] amen all right what do you say burden what do you say when you're afraid korban what do we say when we're afraid to give this to me when I am afraid I will that's right you're being so brave buddy again at the end of that clip did you hear Artem as we were focused on taking care of Corbin Arnaz decided to be adventurous and try to climb out of the back door for the first time which led to a little faceplant and mommy felt so bad fortunately Arden was quickly comforted and daddy was now available to take him outside to play so we could continue filming and not to be left out Alarcon made sure that she got in on the action after Quitman did that and got his finger study do you think this looks an idea for you to do it soon excitement was over and we could truly get back to cooking I got back to mulching the chocolate - it took about five rounds of 30 seconds at 50% power I'm just gonna get all this little list out and I can use the spatula all of the van der Brau instead of folding now we were finally ready to make our shapes you can use any cookie cutters you want to just know that deeper ones are going to make thicker treats and those can be a little bit easier to push your candies into for decorating also this is really messy work which is fine because making messes makes memories but I decided to be the one to scoop the rice krispies mix into the cookie cutters and then let the kids press them down which was a great idea except that I forgot to communicate that to them ahead of time so there were some hurt feelings you get to press it into the cookie cutter so if there is whining and crying we're just not gonna do this remember we do not argue and line during cooking after the previous whining I made sure to plan ahead and have any leftovers evenly divided once the cookie cutters were filled with the chocolate rice krispies it was time to decorate you may want to have a clean pair of scissors handy because they're great for cutting soft candies like Mike and Ikes into flat o bowls or cut the tips for little circles keep in mind that depending on the kid you may have to remind them that the candies are for decorating once you're done I'm gonna stick it in the freezer to get hard the baking sheets go into the freezer for about 15 minutes until the chocolate is really firm then you can carefully push the treats out of the cookie cutters I recommend doing this for your kid because it is possible to push too hard on one spot and break off part of the tree also they may have some tears if they see some if their candy fall off but you can easily fix it while they're busy plate just use a small amount of Milton chocolate as glue to put the pieces back together because the chocolate rice krispies treats are still cool your chocolate glue will harder the very quickly it's also so great to see their delight when they see their chocolate creations fully formed out of the cookie cutters hey hey ready and there you

krispies treats simple and delicious [Music] hello everyone starting off with ten and a half ounces of marshmallows miniature or irregular size and one quarter cup of butter now I put mine in the microwave for about a minute and a half until the marshmallows were nice and puffy and then I blended that butter and the marshmallows together but you can melt these things together on the stove over low heat as well then add in one cup of Nutella now I recommend that you heat the Nutella in the microwave for a few seconds prior to adding it to the marshmallows because I found that when I added the Nutella cold to the marshmallows it made the marshmallows stiffen up very quickly and it made it very difficult for me to blend it in to the rice krispies about 6 cups of rice krispies in a large bowl and what I ended up having to do was to put the whole thing in the microwave for another about thirty seconds or so just to soften it up enough for me to continue to stir but it worked out ok then after the marshmallow Nutella mixture is nicely blended with the rice krispies press it into an 8x8 inch baking dish that's been greased or in this case I've lined it with nonstick aluminum foil I also buttered up the spatula a little bit so that it wouldn't stick and press it down nicely and evenly into the pan now this has a great topping which is 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and one cup of Nutella you can also melt this over low heat on the stove I put mine in the microwave for about a minute or so until the chips were melted stirred it together and then poured it over top of the rice krispies spread it around then put it in the refrigerator just long enough to set the top coating and then cut them into squares now these can be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature the room temperature ones have a tendency to have a very soft topping on them so they're a little bit messy when you eat them but otherwise they are delicious very easy to make tastes a little like regular rice krispies with that extra wonderful chocolate and Nutella hit give them a try now I also have a Nutella playlist that has some great Nutella goodies including this braided new bread so if you want to see the brand video and take a look at the other videos on a playlist go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the About section below thanks so much for watching goodbye", "auAi00g0LNU": "hi it's Rosie Batista with I cook naked calm and of course I'm not really naked but I'm here to show you how to make a low fat healthy cereal bar that using mostly naked ingredients meaning that it's food in its most natural form now this is really simple easy kids will love it I love it it's a great grab and go snack and it's literally one bowl to mix it up so what we're going to do is put all our ingredients into this cereal and the base of the cereal is it's a brown rice krispies cereal which means when I looked at the box and I looked at the ingredients the only ingredient is brown rice period so what I'm going to add to the cereal is 1/2 a cup of peanut butter again you want to watch the ingredients on your peanut butter because it's very deceiving out there some jars of peanut butter will say natural but they'll still add all kinds of extra oil you don't need anything added to the peanuts there's enough fat in the peanuts and enough everything in the peanuts just to be peanuts we have 1/2 a cup of peanut butter 1/2 a cup of date paste to make de paste I use a cup of dates and a half a cup of water soaked overnight and blended and that is my sweetener of choice in all of the sweet treats that I make because dates are a fruit and they respond much better in your body so I'm just going to mix the cereal into the wet ingredients into the sticky ingredients making sure that all of the cereal gets wet there you go easy now I'm going to also add 1/2 a cup of chopped nuts these happen to be almonds but you can use whatever you have or you can mix them 1/2 a cup of raisins and a half a cup of dark chocolate chips I prefer to use the darker chocolate chips the better these are 65% cacao just for an added little tiny bit of a treat and this right here is so much healthier than any of the sugar flavored cereals that you might buy already prepared a store and we're making into a bar so you can grab it and eat it on the run or as your kids are walking out the door or walking in the door so all we have to do with this now is put it in a nice pan and I happen to find this very oblong shaped pan which I like but you can fool around with square whatever you want to do but we're going to eventually be able to cut this into some really nice bars and we're just going to put this right into the pan and you really cannot get much sympathy cereal bar in the freezer for about a little over an hour so what I'm going to do is just separate away from the side this is another amazing kitchen tool because it's just a tiny little spatula that gets out little tiny pieces of bar so it's great so I'm going to just cut this into four separate rows and then I'll cut it into three it just seems to be a nice size for me and there you go your healthy cereal bar and what I like to do for a lot of fun i buy these little cellophane baggies and then I can put an individual sized serving this way doesn't get dangerous and I don't tempted to eat the whole pan into a little cellophane bag and take a little ribbon wrap it up and you've just created an awesome little healthy snack for your family or for yourself because you deserve to treat yourself well I'm Rosie Batista from I cook naked comm ciao for now and I'm going to try to cut the rest of these up and put them in bags before I Cho down on the whole pan they're that good", "agC49XGFjxU": "okay so guys the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to take the lids off and we're going to pour the cereal into the bowl think you guys can do that yes yes all right let's do it good job okay jules job it's okay all right dump it in [Applause] good job those marshmallows are all sticky because it's so hot and humid here in oklahoma so we're gonna put it on the stove and get it all melted down girls are you eating all the marshmallows yes and some of these too look at that what is that is that a whale oh i like these too all right it's starting to melt down a little bit but we still have a long way to go [Music] oh look at that it looks like really really sticky slime mm-hmm just like how it slime mixes into my hands it makes it very sticky look at how stringy it looks like oh but you know what it's not too hard you can't eat it perfect perfect all right what do you guys think have you tried it yet what do you think that's good and it sticks my fingers when they touch it you'll definitely have to wash your hands immediately huh well what a yummy treat huh [Music] that's pretty yummy pretty yummy do you think you're gonna try this you think you might try this with different cereal leave me a comment down below what you think you might do what kind of cereal is your favorite mine i think is cinnamon toast crunch but this is pretty delicious too thanks for watching with us and cooking with us and we'll see you in our next cooking with kids video bye", "mjcR5zHpPoA": "[Music] hi everybody welcome back to anna maria cooks i'm anna maria and today we'll be making these delicious gooey homemade rice krispie treats so you'll it's really easy and today's a rainy day outside and not that nice so these are really easy to make and so yeah let's get started [Music] all right guys so now we're going to go over the ingredients four cups of marshmallows three tablespoons of butter so we're gonna do two different kinds of rice krispies treats we're gonna make the original and a fruity pebbles one so three cups of the regular rice krispie treats and three cups of the fruity peppers you'll also need two baking sheets coated with some spray should i have an adult because we're gonna be cooking over our stove and you don't want to get hurt so first we're gonna melt the butter oh no it already melted on a lowly heated fire we're just gonna wait for we might let's mix it around and then after the butter is melted we're gonna add in the marshmallows guys so you're going to want to make sure you use a low flame because if you use a high one the butter can burn that won't be good you have to start from the beginning so our butter is about done and melted and now it's sizzling so that means we can add in the marshmallows a little bit at a time so wait a minute i remember when we went to disney world last year they had the fruity pebbles one and i loved it every time with covered with white chocolate was what was the best so i would get them every time but then this year since we couldn't go cloven i'm so happy we're making them so it's gonna be like so as you can see the butter helps it to not really stick and just to make it more gooier so as you guys can see it's muffled so we just added it might get a little hard so you can just leave it there maybe to simmer for a couple of minutes just so it can become melting so here's a cool fact you can also make edible slime you just need food coloring i think i watched a video on it you just need food coloring melted marshmallows and some cornstarch to eat it all together and you get slime it's really cool and really fun but you just need to make sure to wash your hands because you don't want like you know dirty so as you can see it's starting to melt okay and come together so you can have an adult help you because it was a little hard because there are so many marshmallows and they were sticking together so you just need to let it simmer like we did and just mix it up guys so this is what it's supposed to look like when it smells and look how nice that looks [Music] so we're gonna divide it now and put in the fruity pebbles and the regular all right guys so now we're gonna mix it this one didn't have it all right guys so now we're just gonna mix these rice krispies so far but it's a good workout guys so it didn't come out as much as we expected but that's fine we're just gonna and they're both on one tray so we're just gonna flatten them out and you need to wait for these to cool but they're super easy except when you need to put them on the stove so and the mixing was a little hard right mixing oh yeah it was actually pretty hard this one wasn't as hard to mix i feel like this one's harder because the rice krispies are more thicker yeah it was a little hard to mix so we wait for them to cool we've been a bad boy today you get stinky spanky all right so we'll wait for them to cool and oh and also can be a drum set one two three four all right out all right guys here's the finished result nice i guess so yeah so if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and please subscribe if i hit 100 subscribers i think i get

I'm willing to be that just about everybody who's watching has made rice krispies treats at least once in their life. They're very easy to make. It's one\nof the first recipes I remember making as a kid, and they are so good. Well today\nI am sharing my rice krispies treat recipe, which is not quite the same as\nthe one on the box. These are gourmet rice krispies treats. So full of\nmarshmallows and full of flavor I think you're going to love them. So let's begin.\nNow to start we're going to need to head over to our stove top where you are\ngoing to need a large pot. I'm going to be using a large Dutch oven to make these. Now you're going to need 6 tablespoons of salted butter, and I highly recommend that if you can get your hands on it, you use a European\nbutter. These butters have a higher fat content. They have a really good flavor, and\nit's really going to bump up your rice krispie treats. Now turn your stovetop\nto medium low heat, and you'll just want to stir occasionally until the butter is\nmelted. As you can see I had cut my butter into 6 pieces. This is just going\nto help it melt faster. Now once your butter is melted, we are going to add our\nmarshmallows. You are going to need 15 ounces of mini marshmallows total.\nUsually a bag is 10 ounces so this is one and a half bags. Now we're only going\nto be using 10 ounces for now. We're going to save that other 5 ounces for\nlater. Add this into your pot. I will stir the marshmallows in with our butter\nuntil the marshmallows are just melted. Now make sure you keep your heat below\nmedium when you're doing this. If you cook your marshmallows on too high of a\nheat you're actually going to end up making them hard and your rice krispies\ntreats are going to be hard and brittle. Once your marshmallows are melted we are\ngoing to stir in one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. This vanilla flavor is another ingredient that makes these rice krispies treats extra special and extra gourmet. Now we will need our rice krispies cereal. You're going to need 6 cups of this cereal for this recipe. We're going to add these in with our marshmallows. And at this point, we are also going to add in our remaining five ounces of marshmallows. Now we are going to stir this until the rice krispies\ntreats are completely coated and all of the ingredients are combined, and that\nlast bit of marshmallows we just added, they should just be beginning to melt.\nyou really want to have distinct marshmallow pieces in these various crispy treats so you don't want them to melt all the way. Now this step is optional, but if you would like to add sprinkles you'll add\nthem now. I'm going to be adding three I'm going to be adding three tablespoons of sprinkles into my rice krispies treats. Now stir this briefly. You want to stir\nit just enough so the sprinkles are evenly distributed. You don't want to\nover mix it. Sometimes the sprinkles can bleed if you do that, and as soon as the\nsprinkles are nicely incorporated we are going to remove our rice krispies treats\nfrom the heat, and we are going to pour them into a 9 by 13 pan that we've lined\nwith wax paper. Now use a spatula, or you can use your hands to just gently kind\nof work down those rice krispies so that they're nice and gently packed into the\npan. You really don't want to overdo it here, otherwise, your rice krispies treats\nwill be too compacted and they'll be tough and they'll be hard. They'll be too\nbrittle I like my rice krispies treats to be soft and chewy so don't over pack\nthem. So these rice krispies treats have had about 30 minutes to cool,  they're still a little warm but I'm gonna go ahead and dig in anyway I'm\njust gonna grab the wax paper it's gonna make it easy for me to lift these out of the pan. And while just pulling pieces off of this nice rice krispies treat block would be fine I'm going to use my knife to make things a little neater. O man, this looks so good, these are still a little bit gooey, because they are still warm. Loaded with marshmallows and sprinkles, and they smell so good too, because of that vanilla and butter that we used. These are going to be great, I can't wait to take a bite. Well that is how you make my favorite gourmet rice krispie treats. If you give this recipe a try please let me know what you think. I can't wait to hear from you, I think you are going to love them.

Back to school time does not have to be that\nbad. Today I have three Rice Krispies treats for\nyou, they are all different flavors, and best of all, they are no-bake. They make the perfect after-school treat to\nlook forward to, so let\u2019s get started. So before we get started, I just wanted to\ncheck with everybody that you all know about YouTube\u2019s community feature. Now over here I post pictures from behind\nthe scenes, sneak peeks of upcoming episodes, and I even get to ask you guys questions. It's really, really fun, it\u2019s kinda like\nYouTube\u2019s version of social media. So what you want to do is subscribe to my\nchannel, which I'm sure you already are, and have seen all of my videos, and then tap that\nbell, because that's what will notify you when I post on YouTube community, so you get\nto be part of the conversation too. Okay, now that's out of the way, let\u2019s kick\nthis all off with a snickers Rice Krispies treat. So in a large bowl we\u2019re going to add some\nbutter, and loads of marshmallows. Now you can use vegan butter and you can use\nvegan marshmallows also if you are a vegan, so that will work really well too. Now what we want to do is pop this into the\nmicrowave for two minutes for the butter and marshmallows to melt. So you\u2019ll notice when you take marshmallows\nout of the microwave they puff up really big, it\u2019s kind of cool. You can also do this in a pot over the stove,\nover low heat, and that will work really well too. So what to do is give this mix a bit of a\nmix around, just to make sure it\u2019s all combined and then we\u2019re going to add in our next\ningredient. Okay this is looking good, let\u2019s face it,\nwho does not like melted marshmallows? Now our next secret ingredient, which probably\nis not so secret, are Rice Krispies. Now feel free to use any kind of cereal that\nyou have at home, they will work really well. I just like Rice Krispies because they're\nsmall and they get coated totally in marshmallows. So in you guys go. It might look like a lot of Rice Krispies,\nit is a lot, you need them. Then once they are all in there, go in with\nyour spatula, and give it a really good stir around, and coat all the cereal in marshmallow\ngoodness. So Rice Krispies treats remind me of when\nwe used to come to Florida as kids, and as a family. We used to go to Disneyworld, used to go to\nall the centers, like Epcot center, Universal, all that sort of stuff, but I remember it\nwas the first time I ever had a Rice Krispie treat that they sold in the stores, and I\nabsolutely loved them. I remember wondering like what is in this? It\u2019s butter, marshmallow and Rice Krispies. Okay, this is all mixed up, it\u2019s really\nsticky, now we\u2019re gonna press it into our tray and start building our other layers. So here I have a baking tray, it\u2019s 7\u201d\nby 11\u201d you can also use something a little bit smaller and that will work really well. I like to get my Rice Krispies treats really\nthick, so I might not actually use the whole tray. So when your mix is still soft and squishy,\nI can actually hear it popping, snack crackle and pop, like it says on the box, go ahead\nand scoop it into your tray. Now if you're thinking to yourself this looks\nlike a regular Rice Krispies treat and where's the Snickers, stay tuned, because that bit\u2019s\ncoming next. And then just take a spatula, and flatten\nit out as best you can. So you guys know I love no-bake treats, and\nI know you do too, that's why I wanted to do something like this, I think you're really\ngoing to enjoy these, and they're so easy to make. The recipe can be found on BiggerBolderBaking.com\nso head over there for the measurements. Now I am gonna set my Rice Krispies over to\nthe side, and bring in my bowl of caramel. Now this is gonna be our next layer. So into here I am going to add in a little\nbit of milk, and then what I'm gonna do is pop these into the microwave and let them\ncompletely melt. Now if you don't have a microwave, you can\nalso melt these in a pot, that will be fine too. So it\u2019s been two minutes and my caramels\nare melted. Check that out. So now I'm gonna bring back in my Rice Krispies\ntreats, and I've got my caramel, you might want to wait until it\u2019s a little bit cooled\ndown and then just go ahead and pour it over your Rice Krispies. A nice, big layer. You\u2019re starting to see where this is going,\nyou've got caramel, we\u2019re gonna have nuts, chocolate, just like a snickers. Feel free to spread your caramel or with a\nspatula, just so you get a nice even layer. Okay, lovely. Next up, toasted peanuts. So the peanuts that I like to use are salted\nand roasted because you get that little bit of extra flavor, it works really well with\nthe caramel, with the chocolate, absolutely delicious. So go ahead and scatter them all over the\ntop and do not be shy with these, a nice thick, generous layer is what you want to do with\nthese guys. All over, until it covers the top. Now what I like to do to make sure that it\u2019s\nall even is just go in with my hand, and press down the nuts into the caramel, just so it\u2019s\na nice and even surface. Okay, great. This is already starting to set. They firm up really fast. So now don't worry, I haven't forgotten about\nour chocolate layer. Here I have a big bowl of melted milk chocolate,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and pour that all over the top. Also make sure that your chocolate isn't too\nhot when you're pouring it over so it doesn't slide around everywhere. You cannot have a Snickers without chocolate. Okay, great, and if you want, take your spatula,\nand just even it all out. There is nothing about this that\u2019s not gonna\nbe delicious. Marshmallows, caramel, peanuts, yummy. Okay so now because this has a chocolate layer\nwe need it to set, so you can actually leave it out at room temperature or you can pop\nit into the fridge and we\u2019re gonna let it set up for around an hour and a half. Just make sure the chocolate gets nice and\ncold. My Snickers Rice Krispies treat is all set\nso it\u2019s ready to be cut. So with a nice, warm knife, go ahead and cut\nnice big squares. I say big because I like everything big, you\ncan do whatever you want. And then look at that, you see the caramel\nlayer and the nuts and the chocolate on top, these are gonna be just like a Snickers. So now if you're looking for more no-bake\nrecipes just like this one, make sure you check out my no-bake granola bars, they're\ngreat for school as well and they're really easy to make. Yummy. This is so good. The reason it tastes like a Snickers is because\nthe marshmallow is kind of like the nougat of a Snickers and then you've got caramel\nand the peanuts, and a big layer of chocolate, I tell you, if you make these, you're gonna\nbe running home after school to have these, yummy. I promise you they're all gonna be as good\nas this one so let\u2019s move on to our next one. With our next flavor, the name says it all. It is a Funfetti Rice Krispies treat. Now just like the last one, in a large bowl\nwe\u2019re going to add in some butter, and marshmallows, and then just pop these into the microwave\nuntil they're fully melted. Then just take a spatula and stir together\nyour butter and marshmallows. Okay, now this is our base, now we\u2019re going\nto build on top of this. Here I have some white chocolate chips which\nI absolutely love, and Funfetti always reminds me of the flavor of white chocolate, I don't\nknow why but it does. So I'm gonna toss those in. there. Next we\u2019re gonna add in our Rice Krispies,\nbecause you can\u2019t have Rice Krispies treats without Rice Krispies. So now here is my secret ingredient, Fruity\nPebbles, this is what is going to make it really looks like Funfetti. Now if you do not have Fruity Pebbles in your\ncountry, do not worry. You can just replace them with Rice Krispies,\nyou can also throw a few sprinkles in there as well to make up for them. And then with your spatula go ahead and mix\nit all together. When you're mixing, take care not to crush\nyour cereal too much, because you want it to stay intact. Okay, perfect. This looks great, it smells amazing, now we\u2019re\ngonna press it into our tin. Scoop your Rice Krispies treat into your tin. I like how it all falls out in one big lump,\nmakes it less messy. And then with your spatula, go ahead and use\nlike the other one, flatten it out on top. Okay, so these have taken good shape, now\nhere I have some more chocolate chips, and I'm just going to scatter them on top, just\nfor a bit of extra crunch and flavor. Okay, so we got nice, even coverage there,\nof white chocolate chips, give them a little bit of a press down with your hand, so they\nstay in place, great. Now I'm gonna set this aside for around an\nhour and just let it set up. I'm very well aware that these treats look\nthe exact same warm as they do cold, but I still think it looks fantastic. When it's nice and set, with my knife, I'm\ngoing to go ahead and cut this one up too. It does help when you have a warm knife because\nit kind of cuts through the marshmallow because it can be a bit sticky. Lovely. And like I said, cut any size that you like,\nthere is no judgment here. Now I have to taste this guy as well, just\nto make sure that he's okay for you guys. Oh, do you see how gooey that is? There\u2019s so much marshmallow. Oh, my gosh, this tastes so good. The white chocolate in it, make sure you don't\nskip that step. Definitely add white chocolate into these. Oh, my gosh. This just keeps on getting better and better. Okay, now onto our next treat. So as usual I always try to save the best\nfor last, so here is a S\u2019mores Rice Krispies treat. So now just like before, I have my butter\nin a bowl, and my marshmallows, I melted them and then I've mixed them all together. Into this, I'm going to add in some Rice Krispies. So what makes a S\u2019more a S\u2019more? Well, then next thing we\u2019re going to add\nis chocolate, because you cannot have a S\u2019more without chunks of chocolate. The nice thing about this, because the marshmallow\u2019s\nwarm, it starts to melt the chocolate a little bit and you get these kind of streaks all\nthe way around, it\u2019s really lovely. So now another component in a S'more is marshmallows. Now I know we already have marshmallows in\nhere but I'm gonna throw in a few extra, just because I can. So now a S'more is made with graham crackers,\nwhich we allow and love, but I've got the second best thing here, Golden Grahams. This is a cereal that you buy that tastes\njust like graham crackers. Now don't worry if you don't have it, you\ncan always leave it out and maybe add in a little bit of cinnamon into your Rice Krispies,\njust go ahead and toss all of those in there. I have to say, this is probably one of my\nmost favorite cereals. So now all of our delicious ingredients are\nin there, now you just wanna mix it up really well together. Just look at that chocolate melting, yum. Just added extra flavor and yumminess. Once your mix is all combined, then scoop\nit into your prepared tray. Once your Rice Krispies treat is spread out\nin the tray nice and evenly, I'm gonna go over the top and add on a few more marshmallows,\nand a handful of Golden Grahams. Look at that, gorgeous. And then just like with the other ones, flatten\nthem down so those ingredients stick on the top. Gorgeous, this looks fantastic. So I don't think we could possibly add any\nmore to this Rice Krispies treat, so I'm gonna set it aside and let it firm up. So now the s'more Rice Krispies treat sets\nup really fast because you have the melted chocolate in there and it hardens, so this\nis even quicker than the other ones. Go ahead and take it out of your tin, and\ncut up your portions. So once you've made your Rice Krispies treats\nyou can store them at room temperature in an airtight container for like up to 4-5 days. They last a long time, and they stay totally\nfresh, so then you've got a good snack to go to. Now my favorite part of the job, I have made\na lot of s'more desserts on Bigger Bolder Baking, and I have to say I think this might\nbe my favorite one. So yummy, and then the toasted cereal in there,\nyum, yum, yum, yum. Just goes to show you, you can enjoy s'mores\nso many ways.

wanted to give you some other cool ideas so you could come up with for your you know candy table so as you can see here I put one stick of butter and one bag of marshmallows and just waited until it was all melted once it was all melted I took it off the stove which I didn't do the first time so it caramelized so this time I took it off the stove and added all the rice krispies right in the you know this thing forgot what it's called guys so as you can see here now I'm putting all the mixture in to this clear pan and I am just going to smooth it out towards the end so it could try to be as even as flat as possible [Music] I am going to put this aside once it's done flattening down and just let it harden up for about 30 minutes you don't need to put it in the fridge you just let it chill in on the side so guys it's time to melt and decorate my items and I wanted to give these candy melts a second try because maybe the first time was just not good but the second time was even worse so definitely know for these candy melts just singing so what I did was I put it in the microwave for a minute at defrost and then another 30 seconds and I think I over cooked this because it kind of got a little chunky which is so frustrating I just don't this is that's it I'm not infusing this chocolate ever again ridiculous so for it to be more smooth and keep a little bit more melted I put a tablespoon of oil doesn't matter what kind of oil I used olive oil and it came out smooth for just a little bit because this chocolate is just ridiculous I need to actually like a candy melt pot because I heard that's really good anyways I am using this stick and then I am going to poke some holes in this marshmallows just leave you a little suggestion I will probably stick the sticks in the chocolate and then spread the marshmallow a little bit open where the holes were at maybe have a little bit more you know I guess a little more grip to them but it was honestly fine because it did not fall off the stick so that is a win so as you could tell here I am dipping it halfway in this mason jar which you guys eventually will guys see me switch out because this whole part was not big enough because I don't know what I was thinking but you know we always had to you know you know trial and error guys like hotel right here it's some of the chocolate was chunky and I think I overdid it with those putting it in the microwave because I didn't think it was melted enough but they still came out pretty cute and I used these sprinkles guy for Michaels for only $1 these little package goes a long way because I still have half of those sprinkles in that little bag definitely worth it see it didn't come out too bad you could tell a little bit with the blue on top but it's fine people won't eat it anyways but yeah that's it for the marshmallow and we're going to be off with the pretzels just like how we did the marshmallows we just have to pit in this chocolate you know tap off the access don't worry the chocolate I'm sorry don't worry the pretzel rod won't break unless you're really pounding it but you should it just lightly tap and decorate tap and decorate no actually you got a dip tap and decorate okay that's all you got to do [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hard so mature [Music] and this is how they turned out not too bad you know just for just trying it out and give you guys some ideas on how it would look so let's get on to the rice krispies treats this was pretty easy all like you could see me here was trying to cut it as perfectly as possible I took it out the pan as you can tell it easily came out because I did spray it before putting it in the pan so it does not get stuck right now I am spreading apart and just trying to make them as perfect as possible into squares you guys if you guys have cookie cutters use the cookie cutters I did not have any cookie cutters that were squared so I just eyeballed it try to make it as perfect as possible and you know they didn't come out too bad you know they actually paste really yummy I love homemade rice krispies treats you know I think they're way better than store-bought but that's just my opinion I ended up doing kind of two ways with these treats I took some aside and didn't put any sticks in them and then the other ones were just rice krispies treat pops and hey guys they came out pretty cute you guys gonna see sue for these treats I am using the white chocolate and just like the blue and the white make sure that comes out as baby blue I just put it in the microwave for defrost for a minute in 30 seconds and I still came out chunky guys I don't understand it was melted but I had a little bit of chunks in it I don't know but as you can see here I took the stick and dipped it into the chocolate just a little way that way just like cake pops guys pretty much just like hey pops as you can see here I was a little bit lazy and did not want to dip it and just grab the spoon and put the chocolate half way through the rice krispies treats and just a few seconds you guys will see me take a fork put it in the blue chocolate that was still melted surprisingly and I just drizzle it on top of those ones that didn't have the stick just to give it a little different feel instead of just having two straight up sprinkles everywhere I just decided just to do this little twiddling methane guys came out still cute honestly [Music] look how cute they turned out not too bad not too bad and just like the other treats we're going to dip or just spread out the chocolate all over the treats and sprinkle and then you're done how simple are these treats these ideas I hope you guys got some inspiration off this video cuz I know I did well if I ever have a boy baby shower to get to but um definitely hope you guys got some ideas remember if you guys are new here please please do me the kind favor subscribe to my channel share this video give me a like give me a comment do all that good stuff to make my heart happy I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I will see you in the next video oh stay towards the end so you can see how they all turned out all nicely cutely displayed not really displayed but you know I got to do what I got to do just for the video anyways guys I always see you in the next one bye how do I know what I'm [Music] tell me how I'm gonna get close in the back turn out making feet walking on my body like working on our body language inside [Music] but you mean everything to me [Music]", "88ShzVVXMiU": "hey there today's recipe is gonna be a super simple one it's gonna be some rice krispies treats and the way I'm doing them is inspired by the ones that you can find at Disneyland they're gonna be in little Mickey head shapes I'm gonna cover some with chocolate and other ones with just a simple pink buttercream you can just make these that's breaking the rice krispies or you can make them into the Disney theme as always all the ingredients and everything you'll need will be in the description box down below now let's get into it all right you're gonna start by heating up a pan with your butter and this recipe is super easy I'm just showing you what you could do with the rice krispies you can make certain shapes with them I definitely want to do the Disneyland ones and then here add your marshmallows and melt that well just keep stirring until all your marshmallows have melted I recommend using the very small marshmallows they melt faster or if you have jumbo ones just cut them in half and then start pouring half of your rice krispies treats once everything is melted incorporate that well and once you have that mix well add in the rest of your rice krispies treats and keep combining that until everything comes together just be careful this mixture will be extremely hot just let it cool down before you start handling it with your hands pour it out onto a sheet pan or any pan that you have I put this nonstick soap ad which is what I use when I make macarons shape out your square and then just put this in the fridge for 10 minutes once your score has chilled and hardened get your cookie cutters whichever ones you want to do or just cut squares directly from this here I'm gonna be doing two different Mickey shapes I'm gonna do small one and a larger one now these cookie cutters I did get them from the resort I know you can find them online handling it is a bit sticky so if you have some nonstick spray or anything use that on your cutters and this is how it should look once you get those Mickey shapes out of this and then here I'm just getting the wrist out in squares since they do have square ones at the park I have melted some chocolate and then I'm just dipping the ear part and half of the circle into it and while the chocolate is still pretty soft I'm getting my sprinkles and just sprinkling the top part and this is how you'll find the regular rice krispies treats at the parks they come in chocolate and I've seen the rice krispy fruity pebble mixture with the pink frosting so I did that as well here I'm dipping those squares into it I'm doing half of the square into the chocolate and it I'll add the sprinkles to that as well and then once you're done doing this to all your rice krispies treats just let them sit and Harden it should take a couple of minutes and then you'll have your rice krispies done and this is how they will look and that's how easy it is to make these rice krispies treats if you want to see pictures of them I'll be posting it on tumblr Twitter Instagram and Facebook and all those links are down below if you make this recipe tag me and let me know I love seeing when you guys recreate my recipes if you want to suggest something else leave it

chocolate and orange go really well together so that's what I'll do so I started here by peeling an orange and I want to make some candied orange peels now this isn't the sharpest peeler of all so you can see I'm having a little bit of difficulty with it but what you want to do is to peel the rind off a navel orange and just go around the whole orange peeling off the rind you don't want a lot of the white just the right and then when you're done with that just set your orange aside and then I'm going to stack up all the peels as best I can pull off that label and whatever else you might have forgotten okay so stack it up and then just cut them into thin strips because I want these to be little garnishes for my crispy treats I have a pot of water boiling on the stove and when that comes up to a full boil i'm going to go ahead and take my orange peels and put them right in so there you have it and i'm going to boil these for one minute after you've boiled them for a minute you're going to rinse them in cold water and I have another pot of water on the stove them and turn that on and get that boiling while I'm rinsing these then I'm going to just repeat this process I'm going to go ahead and reset my timer for a minute put my orange peels excuse me into the pot of boiling water and after a minute I'm going to go ahead and rinse those put some cold water into it now for the third one I'm going to take a half a cup of cold water and three-quarters cup of sugar and put it all into the pan and I'm going to turn my flame on and get this boiling so when this comes to a boil I'm going to go ahead and put my orange peels in and I'm going to turn my stovetop down to simmer because you don't want these to boil and then I'm going to set my timer for 15 minutes and I'm going to let these just simmer for 15 minutes so it's about halfway through and you can see that the liquid is starting to get thick and the orange peels are softening so when these are done I've spread out some fine sugar on a parchment paper and I'm going to pull my orange peels out of the hot liquid and use your tongs because it's really hot now and just take your orange peels and put them right on your sugar now you don't have to coat your orange peels with sugar I just thought it would look kind of sparkly and festive so I'm just going to kind of lightly roll them in the sugar and then I'm going to pull each little orange peel out and set it aside they need to dry I wonder what it would look like if I just twisted it I'd like to twist it before I put it on top of my rice cereal treat at the end yeah that look cute okay so i have a mall setting on a little bored and I want them to dry while I'm doing the rest of the little dessert here so now I have a pretty good size pan because I'm going to be putting a lot of stuff into it and I'm going to start out by putting a half a stick of butter mmm butter how can you go wrong okay yeah man get that melted down a little bit and then I'm going to go ahead and put in a bag of mini marshmallows I just put the whole bag in there and I'm going to stir that and let it melt down and it should become a nice liquid pretty soon and once it does you can add your rice cereal up kind of got it all over that's fine that's part of cooking ok so I'm going to stir my rice cereal and I'm going to coat every bit of it with that thick marshmallow niz you can see down in the bottom well here you go ok now you can see it's really thick at the bottom it's kind of hard to try to move that marshmallow up and get everything coated but when you do you're going to Pat it into a pen this one is I think nine inch by nine inch by two inches but you can use a bigger one if you want these are going to be kind of thick just use whatever pan you have use a hot mint because that pans hot too ok so you're going to just spread it into your pan here's a little tip spray your hand with oil and just smoosh it in there with your hands sometimes the hands are the best tool now I have a package of dark chocolate and I'm going to put in about a tablespoon of oil and microwave this for one minute when you get it out it may just look like what you put in but stir it if you microwave too long it's going to seize up and get all clumpy and gross and you don't want that so you just stir it down until it's liquidy and smooth then you just simply pour it on top of your rice cereal treats smooth it all out and then the whole thing is going to go into the refrigerator so that chocolate becomes hardened again it may take about two and a half three hours in the meantime we're going to make our glaze just spread it all over that looks yummy mmm and then this is what it looks like when it's done oops here here you go okay that goes in the refrigerator ok so now I'm going to show you how to make your glaze I think you're really going to like this too it's about a quarter cup of your orange marmalade nice good orange marmalade and here we go this is the surprise ingredient about a teaspoon of dark rum ah is that good you can use a little more or if you want you can leave it out altogether if you don't like rum or if you don't want to cook with the alcohol it'll be perfectly good without the rub but I just think it adds a little bit of complexity to the orange marmalade ok so here we are I'm going to put a piece of wax paper out and tip my rice krispie treats out on to the wax paper run your knife around the edge so you can loosen it from the pan and then just tip it out oh shoot okay you're going to have to put a board or something under it so that you can cut it there we go alright then you're just going to cut through your rice cereal bars here with the chocolate already on the bottom and all I do is I cut down to bite size pieces these are thick so it's going to be more than a bite size and then i turn my board around and cut back through it going the other way so that you have nice squares okay I have one little cut here left so you can kind of see how it'll be all squares to kind of fall off there at the edge but that's okay you can just kind of nibble on those as you go all right now I'm just going to paint on my glaze excuse me I'm going to paint on the glaze with a silicone pastry brush and these brushes are fantastic they work so well they wash up easily so I'm going to go over the entire top of my rice cereal treats with the glaze with the rub orange marmalade glaze you want to put it on pretty thick because you want that flavor it's so yummy mmm just the anticipation of eating it oh it's going to be so good cover every little bit of the top and use all the glaze that you have just go over every little morsel alright so when you have everything covered you want to get your orange candied orange peels and you're just going to put one candied orange peel on every square if you want to twist it make it look all fancy go for it one orange peel on every square that orange peel is just going to give you a burst of flavor mmm it's going to be so good so there they are the rice treats with chocolate and orange marmalade and that look cute you can package these up into little snack bags and freeze them and you'll have them whenever you want so I hope you'll try these they're so delicious and unexpected dark chocolate orange rum hmm", "5CalFWcR5ps": "hi guys I'm Korra from Easy Clip videos and today

"3LtVzwfqF5Q": "hello everybody welcome back to cook Mysore I'm uploading a holiday-themed recipe every single day this month on December 4th of 24th does that our 1st to the 25th so I'm sure as you guys know I missed a couple days this month so we're gonna be uploading a ton of recipes from now until Christmas so earlier this morning I posted a video with me in my mama and we made something called bold amel which is a Portuguese dessert it's so good as my favorite thing in the world I'm actually 1/4 Portuguese if you didn't know so head on over click the link in the cards here if you'd like to see that video but today or yes also today we are making some Rice Krispies Christmas trees so this is super simple that's why I like waited so late to post it because you can whip this up so

to make something festive this is perfect so let's get started so to make the trees and melt some butter in the pot over low heat and the mini marshmallows and mix until they're fully melted [Music] remove them from the heat and that's a vanilla extract and green food coloring then the rice crispies and mix well allow the mixture to cool just until you're able to like hold it with your hands sprite your hands with some cooking spray and this is going to help you handle these so much better it's not going to stick to your hands it's gonna be so much easier so like trust me just do it now shape them into Christmas trees [Music] then roll the trees in some colorful sprinkles and then set them aside and cool completely and dust them with confectioners sugar and you are done so thank you

"-aSetDVASHk": "hey there it's Steve from serious Quito and in this video we are gonna make a Hershey's crackle bar or Nestle's crunch bar call it what you want I think you're gonna call it delicious two quick things to get out of the way before we get started I will be using this silicone mini loaf pan which will give us six of these candy bars if you want you can do something smaller the macros will be based on this size candy bar secondly we will be using these Pro mix protein puffs in place of our rice krispies now if you are very much clean kedo i think this disqualifies because it does contain a small amount of tapioca enough that we're gonna wind up getting about two grams of net carbs per candy bar but it's not so much the carb thing it's the tapioca thing so call it dirty Kido if you want if you're alright with that let's get to making these things whenever I do anything on a silicone mold I always put it on a small baking sheet just because it makes a lot easier to transport it around it's not all floppy then we'll put one scoop of protein puffs in each one of the cavities and I will link to both a silicone mold and any ingredients that I use down in the description then give this a little shake just to even out all of our puffs and we'll set this aside then in a saucepan over low heat add 3 tablespoons of butter 3 tablespoons of coconut oil and a generous eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla extract when our butter and coconut oil are all melted we will add 2 tablespoons of swerve confectioner's and whisk until it is completely dissolved when your swerve is dissolved you can turn off the heat and we'll just use the carryover heat for the rest of this we have three tablespoons of almond butter you can use whatever nut butter you want I'm using almond butter whisk until the almond butter is fully incorporated into our butter and oil and finally we'll add two tablespoons of unsweetened dark cocoa powder whisk until smooth once the sauce is smooth we will add it to our puffs as you pour the sauce make sure you get around the edges first and then work your way into the center don't worry about covering up all the puffs right away we'll take care of that I like to make sure that I've got enough for all six and then I'll go back and hit the earlier ones with a little bit more then using a spatula or butter knife is poke around at each one of the cavities a little bit to make sure that that chocolate gets well distributed and I don't hit any dry patches of puffs as I'm eating and I finish off by just giving them a little Pat to make sure that they flatten out and then these will go into the fridge for about an hour our trench bar chilled for about an hour I popped it out of the mold hmm what I love about this is first it has more of a dark chocolate taste than a crackle or our crunch bar and as I've gotten older I've really gravitated towards that darker chocolate taste so I really enjoy the taste but then just that the mouthfeel the crispy little pops like Rice Krispies it feels like you're eating a crackle or a crunch bar you can also make this recipe using no sugar added chocolate chips like Lily's for example milk chocolate or dark chocolate all you will need to make your chocolate sauce is 170 grams of the chocolate chips and three tablespoons of coconut oil and then your puffs and you're good to go and also just for fun I decided to compare the macros in my candy bars to a perfect keto bar my bars little higher on the net carbs but they're also a lot bigger for net grams of carbs versus two net grams on a bar fad might have 22 grams this has 18 and protein mine has 14 grams this has 11 so there you go by way of comparison the full printable recipe along with all the macros is on my website link down below and as I said earlier I will link to the various products and ingredients that I used in this video also down below so if you enjoyed this video hit that like button hit that subscribe button and while you're

we would make a really fun recipe that you can go and make at home with your kids so we're doing some brown butter caramel cereal bars NS a cereal bars because you can totally make these with rice krispies but I think this is really fun to raise your pantry if you have kind of a bunch of different cereals in there right now today we're doing some Lucky Charms it's fruit loops but this is also really good with putting that Cheerios and fruity pebbles and you know really anything that you love so just gonna get creative with it all right so the first thing we're gonna do is we are gonna Brown some butter and basically browned butter is just that butter that has been browned and toasted but not quite burns if you burn you've gone too far save it stick right here this is Land O'Lakes unsalted a big hammer stall stainless pot this is a 16 quart stockpot and this is just my favorite stockpot on the planet because it's really great for actually making stock because it's wider not taller it evaporates a lot of water but you can also do so many different you can steer things in here make your rice krispies you can just do a lot so we're gonna let this butter start to melt and then I'll show you a challah bread we're back and we have some very toasty ironic butter and we should go help a customer for a second and yeah we we reached the perfect golden brown it was close there for a second guys that's touching you know so watch it closely all right yeah nice and brown smells amazing this is just gonna add an extra layer of flavor to our cereal bars it's gonna take them from basic to amazing all right and now to go even extra because that's what we do around here is I'm gonna add some caramels if you do not have these like you are buying this will still be amazing but we are using our McRae's brand caramels classic vanilla if you have some caramel sauce in the fridge from making ice cream sundaes you could throw that in you could make some homemade caramel if you want it as well all of it works so I'm going to add that we're gonna start melting the caramels and my recipe normally uses sweetened condensed milk but I don't have any today and I'm not gonna go to the grocery store so I'm just gonna do some heavy cream and we're gonna see what happens so I'm all about using much you've got these days and we're gonna get this all melty okay so the caramel is melted and it smells amazing so now we're gonna add our marshmallows oh my gosh so we're gonna let these get all melty Ashley alright so once these marshmallows are pretty much melted we're gonna turn the heat off I'm gonna add another cup of Marshall is because never cut marshmallows and now we're gonna add keep on mixing all right so we got all mixed up and now I'm gonna transfer it to a 9 by 13 pan that I have sprayed no oil spray Oh y'all this is gonna be interesting [Laughter] she's very sensitive y'all alright hardest part about this recipe is waiting", "jmZpAoU7SZg":

big so you know what use what you got so we're gonna see if we can make a nice decadent treat for the holidays we are gonna start off with using a big pot we're gonna put some vegan butter or margarine actually I guess you could use the same recipe that you would to make a Rice Krispies square so I think it's about a quarter cup for a half a cup I actually am almost done this container so I'm just gonna use everything I have on hand we can always wing it if we have to so we're just gonna let that melt all right so our butter is melted so I'm now going to add in the marshmallows well first I'm going to turn it down to medium just so you'll see once you have the consistency I mean you could use a [Music] little bit so which is perfect to use it up because it will melt the butter and so I have that on medium right now and you put the butter basically so the marshmallows don't stick to the bottom of the pan while we're waiting for the marshmallows to melt so I'm gonna go ahead and get my pan ready and just spray it I have some nonstick the in spray stick as you can see it is actually melting I have it on medium just so it doesn't burn alright so it is melting still I'm just gonna turn it up a little bit you really got to watch this you do not want to have burnt marshmallows cuz that just wouldn't be fun I'm sure many of you have had roasted marshmallows on the campfire and when you burn it it's not very fun you can see it really has started to melt a lot it I'm just continually stirring it if you do happen to use the big marshmallows maybe just cut it down with whatever spatula you're using it will make it melt a little bit faster alright so at this point it pretty much is all melted it's there's gonna be a little bit of chunks but that's okay I'm gonna go ahead and add the rice crispies whoops I mean I'm gonna add the pumpkin cheerios alright so I'm going to turn this off it has got the recipes at all four cups I'm going to see we also have to work quick because it does cool quickly I'm gonna show you so far I'm still gonna add a couple more ingredients in speak and it all mix alright so we are how mixed it up just gonna mix it some more still very gooey but you do need to work fast so you can really smell the pumpkin already I'm gonna add in a little bit of vanilla because I have this pumpkin pie seasoning which always seems to dump it so there we go and a little bit of nutmeg nutmeg this is definitely gonna be a perfect full treat mmm smells so good so I did make it a little bit more marshmallowy some people prefer it like kind of drier but it all in here so this is obviously I'm sure you've made like these type of squares you don't have to bake anything you're just heating up the marshmallows and then whatever cereal you like if you do find it sticky you can rinse your spatula and hot water or put a little oil in it but I think we are good I need it and you really want to pack it down otherwise it's not going to stay together when you go to slice it I'm just gonna get a metal spoon look at that this is my hat one of my husband's favorite treats although he's never had it materials I usually I get with rice krispies so when I saw these holiday pumpkin Cheerios I have to make something with that all right perfect look at that I just get this out of the way so you can just top it with a little bit more cinnamon if you want and of course you could put chocolate chips or even raisins kind of jazz it up and I will show you a finished product when it's done and cooled alright so it looks like it is ready so I'm gonna see if I can just try a piece didn't take very long to cool down actually that's definitely oh you could totally smell the pumpkin very berries good hmm so remember we use the pumpkin cheerios but then we also use some pumpkin marshmallows so it does kick it up a notch it's actually a lot crunchy er than the rice krispies but it's a nice festive treat so I hope you guys enjoy watching the video sorry there's so much flavor in here so sweet and until next time thanks for watching you", "O_Ac8fUuO3o": "[Music] so basically my wife and I our breakfast is always about

"MiKwrIZpAZI": "[Music] welcome back to my channel y'all and today we are going to be doing the best rice krispie treats and we're doing two versions using oreos y'all and we're starting with cookies and cream that are so good y'all and then i'm going to call the second one strawberry shortcake because why not super delicious simple ingredients and quick let's go so i'm starting with one bag of marshmallows and then i also have some butter and i am going to be throwing in some freeze dried strawberries that are super tangy and delicious and then i also have some white chocolate chips that i'm going to throw in there and then of course we have the golden and classic oreos and we cannot have rice krispie treats without rice krispies and then lastly some vanilla and then i am just going to start by crumbling up our cookies in the freeze dry you're going to actually have to chop up because they're a bit chewy but once you get that we'll pull them off to the side and use them later so into your pot we're going to melt the butter so start on a low simmer you guys i started with a higher heat i had to reduce that but you don't want to try to mix this up because it will burn so a low simmer and then you're just going to stir until it starts to melt and then once it does you're going to want to remove it from the heat because again you don't want to cinch this so once you've done that we're going to add the cereal in there and then we're gonna mix it up and so i actually got inspired by this recipe i saw the oreo one the classic one on facebook and then i was just like you know what i gotta have that and i just you know wanted to do a little something extra and you know this takes a classic to a whole different level and it was so good so to that i put half in one bowl and i threw my golden oreo and strawberry mix and i'm gonna also add in some of those white chips which is optional but it just gives you that extra creaminess and sweetness is so good and so i am also going to do the same for the other cookies and while i do that use this opportunity to click that subscribe button if you have not already and thank you so much to those who already have subscribed to my channel and show support by watching a full video commenting and liking thank you all so so much i truly appreciate you and shout out to my fellow creators so i am going to spray my dish which is optional but i like to make sure that these come out clean y'all and so i'm going to put half of the mixture well the half with the classic cookies on one side the cookies and cream and when they we're going to just toss the other strawberry shortcake version on the other side and i mean you don't need to waste a bunch of dishes y'all so i'm going to take some wax paper and i'm just going to press it down and this is going to make sure that it spreads out evenly and gives us good set on it so actually put mine in the refrigerator but you can leave them out and let them sit at room temperature but i want to get a good clean cut and i told you i wasn't going to cut on film because it's never even but it's all right you guys it all goes down the same somebody's going to get a bigger square me but you know it is what it is y'all and here we go super super delicious you guys i'm telling you we were fighting over these i had to make another batch of both okay and listen look

arrests krispies are tangy and fruit flavored hello everyone first thing you're going to do is lightly grease a nine inch baking dish either a springform pan or a cake pan then place five ounces of marshmallows in a medium-sized bowl add an eighth of a cup of butter and put this in the microwave for about a minute on high until the marshmallows are nice and puffy and the butter is melted then stir those two things together until it's nice and smooth now at this point we're making the green portion of the watermelon which is the rind in order to get that color we're going to add some lemon lime kool-aid I added about a half a package to the marshmallow mixture you can add the whole package if you want but lemon lime isn't my most favorite flavor in the world now once I stirred in the half a package I wanted a darker green color so I added a couple more drops of food color just to darken up that shade of green once that's all stirred together add in two cups of rice krispies cereal and stir that in until it is nicely combined and all the little cereal pieces are covered with marshmallow then take a butter - spatula or a buttered spoon and transfer that green mixture into your baking dish and just spread it around the edges of the pan and then using your fingers that have been lightly greased with butter you're going to press it up against the side of the baking dish now this might be a little bit more difficult at the beginning while the marshmallows are still hot but as it cools it'll get a lot easier and what you want to try to get is a nice even layer then you can repeat this procedure again five ounces of marshmallows 1/8 of a cup of butter in the microwave for about a minute until it's nice and puffy and melted stir together and then add your two cups of rice krispies in this case though we're not going to add any food color or any kool-aid because we want it to be white take that white portion and press it in to the baking dish against the green portion try to make sure that it's nice and even all the way around and that it is at the same level as the green now once I made this I realized I didn't like how thick the white portion was thought it was too thick so I took a knife and I just cut off some excess now this was a little bit of an experiment because all of the recipes I found online for these particular watermelon rice krispies I didn't use white so please see the About section below for the my recommendations for the amounts of marshmallows and risk free squeeze you'll need for that white portion now for the final part which is the red portion that's ten ounces of marshmallows one 1/4 cup of butter in the microwave for about two minutes until a marshmallows and nice and puffy and the butter is melted and then stirred together until nice and smooth if you don't want to use a microwave for this step you can just put your ingredients into a pot and melt it on the stove over low heat now for the red layer I used cherry kool-aid and I use an entire envelope for this amount of marshmallows and you just continue to stir until the kool-aid is dissolved you get a nice pink color and then you're going to add four cups of rice krispies cereal now I didn't bother adding any food coloring to the Ritt the pink portion because it was just the perfect shade of pink in my opinion so I'll stir it together until it's nicely combined and then you're going to take that red mixture and press it into the center now what I did is I did this in two or three steps I put a little bit in the bottom and then I pressed it down with a greased spatula added it a little bit more and continue to press you just want to make sure that you don't have any gaps or any air pockets in your rice krispies now we're going to add the watermelon seeds and you can use raisins or chocolate chips for this I recommend that you press them in when the rice krispies have not quite set yet and they're still warm that way it will be easier to press in and the chocolate chips melt just a tiny little bit with the heat of the rice krispies and it just makes them sit in there and stick quite well I wanted to show you here add a little bit of leftovers I wasn't able to fit it all in the pan and the main reason for that is when I first put that green layer in I only went halfway up the sides of that three inch high springform pan I should have went to three-quarters of the way up that way I would have had a thinner green layer a thinner white layer and I would have been able to fit in all of the pink rice krispies but the leftovers were certainly were not thrown out so they weren't lost then I put this in the refrigerator I let it set and I waited until the chocolate chips had solidified again and then I cut it up into triangle shapes and as you can see here I stuck in some lollipop sticks but you can also use popsicle sticks if you want and turn them into a little watermelon or rice krispies Pops and you can even put them into fancy little treat bags with a ribbon and they would make great little party favors this is nice and tangy great fruit flavor and visually it's super appealing I hope you give this one a try now I have a special log of watermelon themed food and of course I have a playlist with all those goodies together in one place so if you want to see it go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the About section below thanks for watching", "8LSfbs39MJE": "[Music] my brother Mike's been on the ranch today we've had such a fun time we've all had lunch and now the kids have taken Mike fishing they absolutely love spending time with them I'm just headed over to the house to pick up Mike because I think he's gonna be ready to get home but I'm not gonna send him home empty-handed so I put together a care package for him part of the care package is just leftovers from our lunch to go with the leftovers I also made Mike a batch of marshmallow crispy treats he absolutely loves them he always has to make the treats just melt 1/4 cup of butter in a saucepan then add a 10 ounce bag of large marshmallows add 1/4 teaspoon of salt then stir it all around until it's all melted and combined take it off the heat for a second then to a large bowl add 6 cups of rice cereal then drizzle on the melted butter marshmallow mixture then stir it all around until it's all combined toward the very end stir in a package of small marshmallows try to get them combined and then each treat will have these nice little chunks of marshmallow after that press the whole mixture into a buttered pan then for a final decoration I just sprinkled on some rainbow sprinkles then I just let him cool completely and set up pediments squares wrapped him individually in plastic wrap and tacked him in the care package for Mike honestly I don't know what he's gonna like better the leftovers or the crispy treats", "PpBr2_0VRBg": "you must remember these as a kid I remember them I'm sure you've had them before rash crispy treats rust krispies marshmallows and some butter they probably take longer to set than they do to cook they're really easy let's take a look first you want to lie on a tin with parchment paper so you're prepared to tip the rice krispies intersect do this first if you want to work fairly quickly once the marshmallows have melted I find it easiest the lightly grease the tin with some butter first which helps the parchment paper to stick and then it's easiest to get your sticky mixture into the tin put your butter in a large pan over a medium to low heat don't let it brown or it won't taste great once the butter is melted you can add your marshmallows you have some of the whole ones at the end if you want if you want to add more texture but I don't I just melt them all you can use large marshmallows here but I use the small ones just as they melt faster I also use the mixed color ones as the end result is a light pink color rather than plain white one but if you prefer the original look just use the white ones once all your marshmallows are melted about 4 to 5 minutes on a medium-low heat you are ready to add your rice krispies you'll need to continually stir once the marshmallows are melting make sure it's mixed well and you're ready to transfer to your tin and also make sure you subscribe to the channel pause the video and check now it makes the recipes easier to follow now the fun begins this is really sticky so I suggest you wet your hands before handling the mixture and you can like the press it down into the tin without getting absolutely covered in it only press lightly here if you press hard you'll end it with hard bars once it's all set we don't want that now you can add anything else you want to or nothing at all the great as they are I decided to use from hundreds of thousands and a little bit of melted chocolate just to ensure to smile on Lucy's face is the biggest one of the day [Music] I'll put the recipe on my blog I'm the method for you guys to follow please don't forget to like the video if you enjoyed it and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "hRYNlwTynfs": "welcome to my mini

my oldest actually used this recipe to earn one of his cooking merit badges for Boy Scouts it's very easy and kids love it so the first thing we start with is three tablespoons of butter and we put that in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt and you compare a nine by 13 pan usually I save my butter and Crisco wrappers to use for just this purpose in the fridge where they can stay strapped and will end up using this also I think I'm going to need a little more than this I'm gonna save that one to use to press the mixture down into the pan so I'll just use a little bit of butter so the pan is ready to melt this little longer [Music] shut up the 10-ounce back so it makes it really fast and easy because you do not have to matter these are a little sticky but that's okay [Music] kids love to help with this super easy stir it up to coat with the butter back in the microwave just make sure on that we'll look that should be about right and then when that comes out we'll stir it up make sure the marshmallows are melted add the peanut butter and then the recipe calls for five cups of Cheerios but I usually use six whatever you have just gooey or the less you use up the Cheerios and then we'll put it in the pan and we'll use the butter wrapper to press it down let it cool for just a little bit and cut it it's great for kids and fairly healthy I used a multigrain Korea's you can use plain you can use Honey Nut I do is hoping that Cheerios are going to be tiny baby going to be happy about that so then you stir up marshmallows and this you have to do pretty quickly because this is almost a candy mixture that's why I have everything already these were my grandma's measuring cups my name I feel very thankful to have them she was a wonderful cook and I always when I cook with them stir that peanut butter in I said this part you need to do pretty quickly there we go that looks as I said whoopsie since now you know why my mother does not allow me in her kitchen and why Theo is finding all of them I don't know what I did before I had the I was always cleaning the floor can hear I'm chewing all right see that is cooling really my nephew Sean loves this so much that for Christmas or birthday I got him a glass bowl another nine by thirteen yeah that way a little bit as you can stick the spatula works fine I just kind of like pressing it down pretty important kind of flap it makes it a little more even - yeah I make this for youth group it's a great little breakfast item it's also great for sports teams I've done it for that boy scout obviously if you have a peanut allergy you can use almond butter though okay all right and then there's the finished product cut it in as many squares as you need for the number of people that you would like to eat happy cooking", "uDPAMJn9-JY": "I don't know if you remember but a while ago I went to Grocery Outlet bargain market and I bought sour patch kids cereal it wasn't that good and I thought what could I do

of your choice I decided to add yellow now go ahead and combine all of your ingredients into one bowl once it's all combined place it in the refrigerator for a couple of minutes so that it firms up a bit and then you're gonna roll them into balls [Music] you can damp your hands with a bit of water to prevent them from sticking to it and your first treat is complete refrigerate and enjoy moving on

more crunchy than the compound I can taste the peanut butter I can taste both and I can also get the crunch of the walnuts which one is my favorite I think I like the sweet the chocolate is nice it's a nice treat my second favorite would be it's a mix between the two I would say just my second favorite and my least favorite but it's really good I think it's mighty spear because I'm not a great fan of one but if you like comfort and you like all the other ingredients in there it's a hit I hope you guys enjoy puts it together these treats as much as I do if you guys got a chance to try this recipe please comment below and let me know which one of them was your favorite give me some feedback how did your trip turn out thank you so much for watching and see you next time bye you [Music]", "Y4p5Y_oTosQ": "welcome this is C's 101 Easter is around the corner so I've decided to make these special treats I'm first going to start off with 6 cups of rice krispies this is just a crunchy rice cereal I have 40 large marshmallows or you can use 4 cups of miniature marshmallows which is about 9 ounces here is 3 tablespoons of butter and I've got 1 cup of coconut and green food coloring because I'm going to turn this coconut green and I'll show you how to do that here in a little bit and I have chosen to put jelly beans in my bird's nest 2 Easter baskets once they're made now you can use any kind of candy but today I've just chosen these beautiful pastel colored jelly beans so let's get started over here on melting some marshmallows and butter add your butter to a large pan get it melting and when the butter is about halfway melted we're going to add the marshmallows because you don't want your marshmallow sticking to the side of your your pot here and if you have a nonstick pot that would be best that as long as you got some butter melting and you get your marshmallows Cody you're okay alright now I'm going to add the large marshmallows right in there and if you use smaller marshmallows they melt a lot faster but make sure that your heat is on low because you definitely don't want your marshmallows Burnie and with the sugar and the marshmallows that could definitely be a possibility alright I'll come back and show you what they look like once they're melted but now let's go back over here and I'll show you what I'm going to do to the board before we transfer all right over here I have 24 miniature muffin pans as you can see this one holds 12 and this one holds 12 and I'm lightly going to give each just a very light coating utter these are nonstick just make sure you give them all a nice little buttering and the certain test one because we're going to use these as the mold for our rice krispies treats that are going to make a nest or you know an Easter basket spring is in the air and here I'm going to use a little butter I've lined two cutting boards with a little wax paper and just to ensure that my rice krispies treats do not stick I add just a little bit of butter because we're going to pour our rice krispies treats out of the pan onto here alright now we're going to add the cereal and incorporate the cereal with the marshmallows until everything is coated very well alright now you kind of want to work fast with this because it can sit up quickly because now after we mix this well we're going to turn it out onto that buttered wax paper make sure you get all the way in the bottom get all that marshmallow incorporated with the rice cereal now you're just going to dump out the cereal and leave enough room so you can put your miniature muffin pans right here okay and get it all out of ten there it is all right and I use gloves on my hands just because it can get really super sticky and I've buttered the gloves so they're not going to stick and now we're going to just make a little bird nest and put them in our our mini pins all right just take a blob stick it down in there okay and make a little well in the center of each nest because that's where your candy is going to go and these are just so lovely for Easter and if you've got kids get your kids in the kitchen because it's a lot of fun for them too all right another great tip for adding in the rice krispies treats and I'm starting on my second pan is to Pat it out flat like a little round circle and then go ahead and put it in to your miniature you know muffin pinch now if you would like to I got too much on that one but if you'd like to add the large muffin pans that's alright and if you would just like to mold these by hand without using some mini muffin pans you can do that too all right you've got about ten minutes to do this in before your marshmallow and your butter start setting up see you can also mold it by hand as well you see and then it turns into a little birth nest or you know a little Easter basket all right see that all right I'm just going to stick mine in my pan all right I've got both of my mini muffin pans completely full and they look lovely so why they sit and firm and I'm going to put it in the refrigerator for about five minutes check I've got leftover rice krispies treats and that could be a possibility which it usually always is and what's so great about that is you can take any kind of cookie cutter here I've got a carrot here I've got a bunny and here I've got an Easter Egg you can just go ahead and fill those up and if somebody doesn't want to eat a basket an Easter basket or you know a little birds nest with eggs then they can have their a little individual rice krispies treat in an Easter design scene just put them right in there and then they pop out very nicely 10 there's you've got an Easter Egg treat all right and for the carrot we're going to do the same thing just fill that with your rice krispies treat leftover and now these are plastic and I didn't butter them so I have a feeling they're probably not going to stick to the cookie cutter itself that if you feel like you need to refrigerate them before you pop them out of your cookie mold do so because it's all all right there we go and there's the carriage here we go let's pop it out now that has a thin little piece in the center from the carrot and the top of the carrot so I'm going to just put it together like that and here you get a little a little carrot all right and now of course funny bunnies got to be the favorite at Easter time and if you want to take a frosting and make little eyes and pink ears that's strictly going to be up to you all right and there's the Easter Bunny all right get down in there saying by this time you get to your rice krispies treat it'll be cool enough to where it'll pretty well hold your mold all right and just two doubles and force the ears how cute is that and just put more nice crispy treats right there kind of glue them together so they won't pop off but as they sit they'll be fine all right and now I'll show you how I'm going to arrange the Easter basket or furnace whatever you want to see if I'm going to show you how to turn the coconut green we're going to apply just a few drops of green food coloring and you're going to take a fork and you're going to start tossing it around until your coconut starts turning green all right I transferred my coconut to a larger ball that way I can use the back of my fork and really smash that green food coloring into the coconut it made it so much easier and once you get it the way you like it which this is just the way I like it I'm taking a serving platter then I'm going to put my my Easter treats on or my Easter baskets or my bird's nest and I'm going to sprinkle it around on the plate all right and now I'm ready to fill my Easter baskets or my bird's nests with the pastel jelly beans now I've taken my Easter basket out of the refrigerator and I'm going to arrange them on top of the coconut I went back and flattened at the bottom of the Easter baskets or egg nests and you may also add a little bit of the coconut in the baskets if you wish that's not necessary but I saved a little bit here on the sides as I was flattening the bottom of my little mess but it what makes it look very lovely and then I just add my chili beans into each basket you can add two you can add three or you can just add one and I go around and continue doing this until they're all full okay here I add three and the kids absolutely love these little treats here they are my rice krispies treat Easter baskets filled with any candy in life now let's see what it looks like on the inside oh just like a rice krispies treat pull it apart give it a try mmm yummy she was like what a joy me nice sweet fun to make enjoy happy Easter to all my subscribers and those of you who are checking out this video until next time I'm Toronto with Susy 101 enjoy", "D9JD8etxepw": "hi my name is Marni I use they/them pronouns and I'm gonna teach you how to make one of my favorite treats rice krispies treats rice krispies treats are as some of you my housemate included might call them rice krispie bars are three ingredients that is butter marshmallows and cereal so the first thing we're going to do is we are going to start with three tablespoons of butter which I already have in my pot and I'm gonna turn that so you can see would be but I've got this wide pan and I'm just gonna push the butter around and let it melt completely yeah if you have like a nonstick pan that would be a very good choice to use for this I do not so this is what we're gonna live and you'll see why in a little bit as that's melting I'll tell you what we're gonna do next which is once this is all the way down we are gonna add ten ounces of marshmallows which is the bag this size I like mini marshmallows better than full-size because they melt a little better they melt a little more evenly but either really works so 10 ounces which is this size of bag and I believe that is for cups double check it was also on the back of the rice krispies box so yeah one 10 ounce bag or four cups we've got that belt a little fun fact this is actually the second time we've made this recipe for her work because the first time the videos did not save right and got corrupted so take two luckily it's crispy treats are one of my favorite desserts as I mentioned before I like them because they are super easy to make into other things other shapes other flavors you can use pretty much any cereal you want they're gooey they're crunchy I honestly just like straight up what's not to like love me some rice krispie treats awesome so that is just about all the way melted and yeah you can use different types of cereal too you can use like everything from like you know Cheerios to fruity pebbles to cocoa puffs magic stars generic Lucky Charms alright awesome so our three tablespoons of butter but you're gonna for all those marshmallows alright so again 3 tablespoons of butter 4 cups / 10 ounces and then you're gonna just mix that together until it all melts we want one big like marshmallow we do honestly it's just like you know I would love to just like have a cool full of marshmallow goo go for a little swim that thing said you want to be careful cuz this is gonna get hot and when you get something that is hot and sticky on your hands it can actually burn you worse than other things because as it is sticking to your hand it is just gonna be holding the heat there that's why it is so easy to get burned when you're making caramel so in conclusion don't go swimming in a pool of melted marshmallow yeah I'm using a rubber spatula to do this just because I like how it makes it easier to kind of scrape down the sides more evenly I'm gonna use it later as well to push them down into my pan but you can use a spoon I think I probably wouldn't use is like a wooden spoon cuz it would be kind of hard to clean it just using a rubber spatula melting it all the way through very exciting it smells really good and a little bit I'll tell you how you can add chocolate chips mmm stuff to it along those lines as well we're not quite there yet like I mentioned before to you one thing that's really cool with Rice Krispies nice crispy treats is that you can mold them into pretty much any shape like I feel other seem like Cake Boss or any kind of like cake competition where they're trying to make cakes into weird shapes a lot of time when they have those like 3d shapes and so if they're actually made out of rice krispies because you can mold them so easily awesome that is completely melted together so I'm gonna take that off I've made a mistake for double bagging before and all that you're gonna do and then that look like slightly sticky cereal [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright so we just had to cut two seconds because actually broke the rubber spatula which is new and while we were gone my husband ate told me that they actually really like using wooden spoons for rice krispie treats and if you want to tell what you just told me as far as why oh yeah cuz it gets through all that thick goopy cereal yeah that's why I like it and I feel like I can get it out of the pan really easy some of us just leave our first an overnight just get in the way awesome so that is o coming together and all it cost was cool so that is pretty well mixed Capeman I'm gonna spray this down you know want spray it too too much this one's gonna end up like greasy but you want to get it just enough that the rice krispies treats aren't gonna just like stick into it you can also use a glass pan a little bit easier but and again you don't want like tripping off or like anything like that you definitely want to make sure so I'm just gonna scoop all this in here nice gooey mixture I'm trying to go kind of quickly because this burner is still hot I don't know if you can hear my cat like a fool in the background the last time we found this she older and then went over to mine kind of hung out there for a little bit and then started chasing your tail on my shoulder she's a real she's a real bear laughs that's for sure well jokester alright so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my spoon spatula whatever you're using I'm a solution down if you want a good way to do this to you is if you take like a piece of parchment paper or even like wax paper it's not too too hot you can even like use your hands too we want to like push it down enough that it's not gonna just pull apart when we cut into it we want to make it like one solid mass of rice krispies treat these are sweet I'm never gonna be sweet actually right about now is if you want to add like M&Ms or chocolate chips anything like that even like sprinkles you could put them on the top and press them in as you're going down you don't want to fold them into it or mix them in because then they will just end up melting and you will end up with gooey chocolaty rice krispies treats which is not the worst but like not usually what people are going for if you do want chocolate rice krispies the best way to do that and keep the consistency the same is to just use like a chocolate cereal Oh Coco rice crispies do uh mama no I'm not up to date on these cereal offerings anywhere really awesome alright so that's about as even as I think it's gonna get we are gonna set this to the side for like 30 40 minutes and then we're gonna come back to it and slice then see you know alright our rice krispies treats are just about set they're good to cut into nope rice krispie treats but yeah they very really nice I got a good eye on them as well if you want them to be taller you can always use a smaller pan and just make them higher up and less of them but that's how you make rice krispie treats", "mA-KBomm6MQ": "welcome to another episode us in this area today on the show we're going to make peanut butter and honey cereal bars and then this small candle I have got 1 and 1/4 cup of peanut butter and a cup of honey and I've just got it on a low medium and I'm just basically melting it together you don't have to bowl it or anything you're just hating it up and honey and peanut butter become one okay our peanut butter and honey mixture is done now in this bowl I have got 7 cups of touched it out do you think the honey nuts we're just gonna mix together okay just make sure your cereal is all covered with the mixture now I've got a sprayed blast 10 inch pie plate but you don't have to use a pie plate you can use an 8 8 or 9 benign square opinion just smash them down to make them laugh a lot you know like you do rice krispie treats I'm hitting switches for their Matt oh right just so I can press it down with my hand I'll make sure it's compacted even once your cereal bars to fall harder okay I'm gonna leave it on there and then it cool and set up and then after it sets up we'll cut it into squares", "GMFPO1sa7IQ": "going into I think our first week of quarantine and I'm filming this in my pajamas just because this was a quick thrown together video and needs us and minds from stories and you guys wanted the recipe so here it is you're going to need rice krispies marshmallows salt butter unsalted vanilla extract and condensed milk we're gonna melt four tablespoons of butter again check the description box for the recipe I'm only making half because it's all that I have left four ingredients and then I'm just gonna take a little sliver of that and grease the pan for the treats good amount half a stick of butter I'm just cutting up my marshmallows the recipe calls for mini marshmallows but I don't have any so I am just making it my own butter is melted at the condensed milk and you want to stir that through until it bubbles up now we want to drop it in the marshmallows all melty once everything is melted turn off the heat and add in a 1 teaspoon of this to the cereal add in the rest of the marshmallows you want to move quickly so that it all melts together I like to go in here and just press out any marshmallow that's still home just so that it creates a nice gooey texture and it to our prepared baking dish take the spatula and press it down you don't want to press this down too tight because you want to be able to just flip it out of the pan when it's ready try to give it as even as possible sit for an hour and it'll harden up this has now been sitting for a couple of hours and if you greased your pan that could easily lift I'm just gonna hold down onto it so it doesn't come flying out at once turn it over this is still really soft so you can manipulate the shape Forks or you know fourths my husband is behind the camera today and yesterday when I made these we gave away pretty much all of it to my sister-in-law and he was very sad but I think he's happy today because these are pretty much all ours that's mine well I think this one is the biggest one okay that was my it's like Bowie and it's nice and soft I don't like Rice Krispies that are hard don't punch you I have a major sweet tooth but I don't bake so anything that's no bake is a win for me I'll see you guys in another video stay safe", "sZxzvDmmdzg": "see real time see real time see real time what's up cereal heads today we're going to talk about rice krispies treats cereal so I already did a video about Rice Krispies cereal and it's a fine cereal but to be fair it's kind of boring the best thing you can do with Rice Krispies cereal is make rice krispies treats now when I make my rice krispies treats I add a little spice to them just a little capsaicin oil or hot sauce well the marshmallows are melting sounds weird but the spiciness with the sweetness so good trust me now rice krispies treats were supposedly invented in 1939 by someone in the General Mills food department and they've been popular ever since rice krispies treats so good it's hard to believe how easy they are it's worth any amount of trouble as long as it makes you happy so these things were so delicious of popular I'm not sure why it took them 50 years after they mentioned to make them into a cereal but in 1993 Kellogg's finally had the brilliant idea to bring them to market here's a box from 1993 now I love this box for two reasons one it's just a really cool color and two it's kind of three-dimensional now you can't tell from the video but the word treats and these little pieces here kind of pop out a little bit from the box and on the back of this box they have a drawing of the rice krispies treats machine showing how they supposedly make the cereal the commercials were kind of boring here's an ad for the cereal house krispies treats cereal I love it yeah me too when you eat the cereal proceed carefully one taste it's never enough you'll want to move fast to get it you hear something cuz now you can make a marshmallow a taste of crispy clusters part of this complete breakfast so the stereo was basically rice krispies clumped together with marshmallows but it was crunchy not the gooeyness you get from rice krispies treat until you submerge it milk but it actually wasn't a sweet as some other kids cereal at the time you can see here they compare them to honey nut cheerios and Apple Cinnamon Cheerios kids love this stuff and it stayed on shelves for years but then sometime in the mid 2000s I couldn't find it anymore I thought maybe they discontinued it but then I was happy to discover that you could still buy it online orange stores in Canada the box isn't is cool but it's still the same cereal the same recipe let's check it out so here's what a bowl this stuff looks like you can see there's a bunch of crumbs in this one but it's basically just frosted rice krispies clumped together here that still got the snap crackle and pop sound man this cereal is good so much better than regular rice krispies so if you can't find this stuff on your grocery shelves head online Amazon or Ebay and pick yourself up a box you won't be disappointed thanks for watching until next time stay crunchy it's like Braille see real time see real time the real time", "KBx5fN9MzW0": "what's up guys i'm looking for my tripod so i can show you how i make pumpkin rice krispies treats for sure bars but somewhere somewhere in this store is my tripod still nowhere i just don't know where why cover your camera oh found it i want to show you how to make rice crispy treats i don't know why i think about this sooner but um i already put the sugar and the butter together so let's flip that around okay so in this pot what i put in here was one and a half cups of simple syrup now that's not available to everybody unfortunately so if you do one and a half cup corn syrup or rice syrup that will work and then a full stick of butter so that's what we have in here it's one half cup of simple syrup and a full stick of butter okay so we're gonna do the gelatin the gelatin is to bind the rice crispy together since we don't use actual marshmallows that already are made with gelatin because homemade marshmallows cannot be used in homemade rice krispies treats due to the fact that the homemade marshmallows have too much moisture in them so let's do it the deconstructive way and how to make a rice krispies treat so again we have our syrup going and now we're gonna do the gelatin all right so as far as water goes i'm gonna do 1 4 cup of water i use filtered water just because marshmallows anything takes the taste of whatever so we're gonna do 1 4 cup of filtered water so 1 4 cup of water and we're going to do five heaping teaspoons of gelatin so gelatin we use uh kosher gelatin and our marshmallows our treats uh we don't we don't use any gelatin that is derived from uh pork it's all beef based so it's 5 teaspoons of gelatin into 1 4 cup of water then of course i use a little whisker whisk to mix up the gelatin [Music] what i use to make rice krispies treats is uh frosted rice crispy cereal i have to do the frosted because that layer of sugar around the cereal protects it from the moisture and it seems to be the best when it comes to making my cereal treat bars so we're gonna do two boxes of these guys beeping i have to grab the sugar here's the butter and the simple syrup mixture and we're going to add in our gelatin then you want to stir it so that way the gelatin melts into the butter now that the butter and the syrup have mixed together i'm gonna add um marshmallow fluff to it two full cups heaping cups of uh marshmallow fluff [Music] then you just want to incorporate the marshmallow fluff with the butter syrup and get it all melty now the marshmallow fluff is incorporated with the butter and syrup and we're going to add the flavors in there to make sure that we get that pumpkin taste that we're wanting for the rice krispie treat okay we're gonna add orange food coloring because pumpkin orange we're gonna add pumpkin emulsion so we use and we're gonna use pumpkin pie spice so let's add those ingredients to our marshmallow fluff and then we're ready to go okay you're probably thinking patricia how much did you put in of all those ingredients and i'm very much of a dash of this a little splash of that a little bit of this and i have no idea i like that then you understand what i'm saying if you need to have measurements what we did was i added five drops of orange food coloring a teaspoon of pumpkin emulsion and probably a quarter teaspoon of uh pumpkin spice your marshmallow fluff and then we're gonna pour it over our cereal and then incorporate the cereal in the fluff until you get a sticky consistency [Music] okay once incorporated then we're going to pour this into our pan and get it to set these are the pans that we use here in our store and we're going to do is we're going to spray pam in here grease it down so that way the marshmallow comes out and then we will cut it right out we'll let it set we're going to let it set for about two hours and then we'll cut it and show you guys what it looks like okay once you've poured it into your pan your knees just patches are flattened out you definitely want to use some ham to get on there so that way it doesn't stick to your spatula so spray some pam and then press all right there we go it's a flattened rice krispie treat and we're gonna let that set for two hours before we cut into it what's up mallow peeps it's the next day uh got a little busy while i was making the rice krispie treat and begin to finish but next day and we're ready to cut our rice krispies treat our pumpkin right here's the pumpkin now i know i said you can let it set for two hours and then it's ready to cut you can even cause that has said overnight and it'll be ready to cut so i mine sat overnight so let's cut this and go from there [Music] with this guys you can get 16 pieces out of this cut so we're gonna do four and then four [Music] so [Music] [Music] there we go there's our pumpkin rice krispie treats to enjoy you guys you can get these online or in store we'll have them through the month of october all right guys that's it for my rice krispie treat tutorial thanks for hanging out with me and you know hanging out doing things making marshmallows um so yes so here is our rice crispy pumpkin rice krispie treats has hints of flavor a pumpkin it's there you go that little pool again these are not like your normal rice krispies treats only because these are homemade marshmallows and we don't even use homemade marshmallows in our rice krispies treat because they have too much moisture and they tend to make the cereal soggy not soggy still not even stale it's just chewy it makes the cereal chewy and so unfortunately they're nothing like the store-bought ones but they taste amazing there's crunch but it's a good snack so make sure to support small business during this time holiday season if you have some ideas of what you guys would like to see me make next let me know um give me some recipes i can try out i'm always up for making new things and trying out new stuff so let me know what you guys think and um yeah i hope you enjoy this video and i'll try and make another one and make sure we're taking care of each other um be respectful to one another and we'll talk to you soon bye", "REyRTjS0yEk": "hi guys and larvae tally you know this episode of Laurie - kitchen I want to share with you my recipe for chocolate peanut butter balls now listen I know that these are usually made around the holidays but I'm not bound to a holiday to make a treat estimate treat I am assessed with these this recipe actually was influenced by one of Joe's family members and she actually makes these around Easter and Mother's Day and Father's Day like pretty much all year long and since Father's Day and Mother's Day are kind of coming up I thought this would be a really great treat to package up in a nice little box and give to your loved one for a nice little treat or a present or whatnot they are so easy to make they should really be called chocolate peanut butter crispy balls but whatever you say potato I say potato is the same thing you're going to set off with some confectioner sugar you also need some rice cereal any kinda you like some creamy peanut butter a little bit of unsalted butter and you're going to need a little bit of vanilla extract and you're also going to need just a couple more ingredients to make the chocolate coating but that's going to come in a little bit so for now it is so easy and simple just you wait and see I've got a small saucepan into my sauce pan I'm going to add my unsalted butter and I'm just going to melt this over about medium heat and then we'll add our next ingredient okay this is about where I wanted to add the vanilla and now I'm going to just turn that off and I'm going to add my peanut butter I sprayed my little bowl with some nonstick spray so that it kind of pops out really easily and now I'm just going to take my time and mix in the peanut butter and the butter until everything is nice and creamy and smooth you might have to turn this back on medium heat in order for it to melt a little bit quicker but just take your time and be patient I should have used a much bigger skill you know much bigger saucepan but what can I say can't think right sometimes okay how fabulous is that looking I like to take a bath in there so if any of you you want to go and buy a few I don't know thousand things of peanut butter and butter and fill the bathtub for me yet appreciate it okay so this is done and now it's just a question of putting everything together it's really easy you've got your rice cereal your confectioner's sugar and want to pour this lusciousness all over the top now I do want to say one thing you can adjust the amount of confectioner's sugar that is in this recipe you can adjust it to however much you like now some people like to put like a pound of sugar in here mmm I on the other hand like a modest amount to much but yet not too little I think this is a perfect amount but if you make this recipe and you give it a taste along the way and you just find that it needs a little more sugar than by all means just add a little bit more sugar now what you need to do because you'll think to yourself it's never going to come together it's never going to hold but it will what you need to do is just be patient and mix this with your spatula until every piece of every little bit of powdered sugar is no longer visible you want it to be really incorporated you want that rice crispy you know that rice cereal and the powdered sugar to be well coated in that buttery mixture so just take your time and give it a good mix get that upper body workout that you forgot to do this morning get it done now this is what you are looking for okay so now what I have here is I just filled my bowl with a little bit of water and I also have a baking sheet with some parchment paper that I've sprayed with nonstick spray and I've got my little handy dandy little ice cream scoop that's about a teaspoon size and what you're going to do is you're going to just form them for now and then we'll give you all a roll once you have formed them because you could do this just with your hands but I always find that they kind of vary in size so form them and then we'll roll them and we'll get them chilling once you have them all sort of form you know you got all your you're battering the same size you want to just take your hands damp them with a little bit of water otherwise it's going to just stick to your hands and give them a nice little roll they don't have to be perfect I mean mine certainly on perfect some are bigger than others but who cares that is a beauty of anything that's homemade you know it's got that rustic sort of charm to it now once I have rolled each one I'm going to pop this into the fridge these need to set for a good couple of hours you can even do this the night before makes life really easy if you've got a bunch of people that you're making these for you can double or triple the recipe it's completely up to you they're really fantastic if you're doing like a baby shower or a bridal shower or just anything like that will you do just you know give out a favor I always love giving out food so this is a great one to me because everyone loves them and they're just so easy so I'm just gonna form them let them chill and then we will cook them okie dokie these I've had a couple of hours in the fridge and they are set and they are perfect and ready to go so you're gonna need to make you see how I went just for like one thing to another if it isn't so excited it's not even funny you're going to need to make a chocolate coating to coat these in what I've got here are some semi-sweet chocolate chips and some vegetable shortening it's kind of important that you have your vegetable shortening it's going to give you the right consistency the right shine and mix it up to that the chocolate won't crack you can melt this over a double boiler or you can do it I'm going to do I'm going to pop it in the microwave on the melted chocolate setting and let it melt for about 60 seconds giving it a stir every 15 seconds or so to make sure it's getting melted evenly so I'm going to pop this in and then we'll go kit we'll get to coating okay this looks perfect and now you just take your little peanut butter balls you can do this with two forks if you want to or you can do it with your fingers however your heart desires and you just dip them in there and like as all that's

"Marshmallow cereal bar. Marshmallow cereal bar. MARSHMALLOW CEREAL BAR. You will need 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 teaspoon\nof vanilla, 4 tablespoons of poison, 4 cups of marshmallows, 1 corpse, and 5 cups of cereal. Grease a pan. Then, place the butter and marshmallows in\na pan over the stove. Turn on the heat, and watch the marshmallows\nslowly melt away, imagining them as a metaphor for mankind, slowly rotting away until there\nis nothing left. Compose poetry about how this makes you feel. Roses are red. Violets are blue. Death. Once the marshmallows have fully absorbed\nyou're message and become goopy globs of fear and confusion, stop the heat, and add the\nvanilla. Mix in the cereal, noticing the unique shapes\nand textures of each piece of cereal. Think about the beauty of individuality. Then, take a small section of the mixture\noutside. At midnight, rest the mixture on top of the\ncorpse. Shout as loudly as you can into the sky: MARSHMALLOWS! The marshmallow gods will take your offering,\nand the corpse will slowly rise into the air. Quickly pour the poison into the mixture. The gods will die. Return to the kitchen and continue the individuality\nof the cereal until the cereal bars have cooled off. Eat the individuality. You are more powerful than it, you are more\npowerful than the cereal. You are, in fact, more powerful than everyone. You will rise into the sky, the new marshmallow\ngod, more powerful than any of the puny mortals below you, and you will see the fear in their\neyes. They are like the individual pieces of cereal,\nnow, and you will bake them into a delicious marshmallow treat.

a surprise filling on the inside and also a surprise coating on the outside I'm also going to show you how to package them really nicely in case you want to take them to a wedding or some other type of formal occasion so with that being said if you're ready let's go ahead and go over the ingredient list that we're going to use for today six cups of rice krispies four cups of miniature marshmallows three tablespoons of butter or margarine medium to large saucepan for rice krispies treat mixture cookie sheet lined with wax paper and a cookie cutter the size of your choosing Ghirardelli milk chocolate and caramel squares or whatever kind of candy feeling you'd like wilton candy melts chocolate and white chocolate or whatever colors you'd like squirt bottle for the melted candy wafers and candy bags and ribbon for when the rice krispies treats are done where they can be stored okay guys what we're gonna do first is make our rice krispies treats and I've already got the butter in here and I'm melting it over low heat once the butter gets melted we're going to put the marshmallows in and melt all that and then stare the rice krispies in blast okay it looks like our butter is all nice and melted and I lumps or anything left in it so I'm gonna go ahead and put our marshmallows in this is still on low heat you guys you don't want to cook or burn your marshmallows okay I finally have some melted marshmallows see what you're supposed to look like here now I'm still got it over low heat but I'm gonna stir in these rice krispies treats while it's on low heat and then remove it from the heat look overwhelming with rice krispies treats but once you get all the marshmallow stirred up in here not all the way because we're gonna fill it with our chocolate just press it down well don't rush too much take your time and make it look good it's gonna be very sticky once you get that in there take your chocolate smush that there a little more be sure to fill in all around the edges here gonna have to get some cooking spray on my hands if it gets too sticky you might want to spray your hands coming out better than I had hoped never feel they rice krispy treat with anything so this is the first time for me to see that it's perfect look there all right make a few more here I'm gonna take that off the burner there all right remember put a thin layer at the bottom don't put it too high this would be good for Valentine's Day or Easter you could do heart-shaped cookie cutters or egg-shaped cookie cutters or anything Christmas all right another piece of chocolate in there don't sweat it if your chocolate breaks then I mean it's in the middle of this anyway so it doesn't really matter press it down at the top there and I sprayed my cookie cutter here with a little bit of Pam just so that these wouldn't stick to it as I was doing this all right perfect look at that I'm gonna do these last two and then I'll be right back with you guys after I finish that okay this is what it should look like when you're finished I've got the chocolate in there it doesn't have to be perfect because you're going to coat it just a little bit so that's what I've got and I had some left so I went ahead and used it and then 8x8 pan to make some regular rice krispies treats for my son so what I'm going to do is put this in the refrigerator and let it cool you don't want it warm at all because you're gonna melt your chocolate candy melts to coat this and you want it cold so the melts will stick to it and Harden so that's what I'm gonna do and put these in the fridge and I'm gonna start melting my candy melts and bring them out and I'll be right back with you guys okay they're ice crispy treats of cold and I've got the chocolate melted you might want to just eyeball it and see what size dish works for you I put this in the microwave for 30 second intervals it took 130 seconds and I took it out and stared it and then I put it in for another 30 seconds and stared it and it was finished so take your rice krispies treats they're completely cool and I'm gonna find the side that I didn't quite get covered I'm gonna dip it in dip it in diagonal it diagonally excuse me like this and I'm gonna use my spoon to get the chocolate where I want it to be and cut both sides here and you just want to shake off the excess lay it back on here and it's just a little bit so I'll cover that up if your chocolate gets a little bit too thick you can always add a teaspoon of cooking oil to it and it should thin it out a little bit find my chocolate side here dip it in I'm leaving a little bit of rice krispies treat showing at the top there let's go around make sure you got all the edges cover it up it's just what it looks like right now doesn't look like very much but wait till this hardens I'm gonna put it in the fridge and let it do that and then we'll come back I'm gonna melt the white chocolate in the meantime and I'll show you what this is gonna turn out to look like okay my chocolate is completely cooled off and I've melted my white chocolate here and I've got it in my squirt bottle I cut the end to be the end of my squirt bottle here to be really thin because I don't want these stripes to be really big I'm just gonna quickly go over it real thin these white stripes looks good all right bring you over here and let you see what they look like this shouldn't take very long to cool and once the white dries we're ready to package them up so I'm going to give this a little bouncing them in the fridge for maybe five minutes or so and let this cool off and just and harden on there completely and then we'll package them up really nice and let you see what they look like wow what a step up from regular traditional rice krispie treats look at this they look so professional these have worked so good for special occasions like party favors for weddings or baby showers or anything you don't have to use these colors remember you've got your little surprise candy inside your coating looks very professional on here I love these they're so easy to make it didn't take me hardly any time at all maybe 45 minutes to make them not long at all so I definitely recommend trying them they taste really really good alright guys that about wraps it up for this week but I really appreciate you taking the time to watch my video I had such a great time making the rice krispies treats for you guys and don't forget to click the subscribe button at the bottom or the top of the screen because I have a new video that comes out every Sunday thanks again for watching guys bye-bye", "3-co21BOJDA": "hey it's Danielle Smith back with style in your life bringing you into the kitchen today wanted to do a fun recipe with you fun delicious and easy that's one of the things my kids love I can do it with my kids I can do it on my own and have it ready for them when they get home from school we can also do it over the summer because I know many of you will be heading into summer vacation very soon Nutella rice krispie treats this is one that I found on chef in training calm very easy for you to find as well and of course we've got the recipe right here for you lots of simple directions you need rice krispies treats you need Nutella butter you need marshmallows chocolate chips milk chocolate chips and some shortening that's it so let's get started 6 cups of rice krispies treats that's the first thing we need I've already got 5 cups in the bowl we will add our sixth cup for you and once you do the six cups of your rice krispies treats you are going to set this aside and head over to your stove heading to the stove once you've set this aside all you need initially are your marshmallows and a quarter cup of butter and you're going to melt the two of these together half a stick of butter so a quarter cup of butter and an entire 10 ounce bag of marshmallows is what you'll be melting first melting these together and obviously stirring as you go so they don't get too sticky while you're waiting and watching your marshmallows and your butter to melt I will grease the pan and one of the ways that I do that because I don't like to get any the butter on my hand I put a little plastic bag on my hand put the little butter on that plastic bag and then I can grease the entire pan without getting anything on me but you do want the pan to be greased so that the mixture doesn't stick too terribly once this mixture is melted the marshmallows and the butter then you are going to add in overflowing 1 cup of Nutella and this is where you learned that about this size of Nutella at 13 ounces is just more than your heaping cup so you're going to add the entire thing when I was a kid my grandmother made the best rice krispies treats that was one before I understood the goodness that was Nutella pour the mixture into your grease pan spread it around and then we will go to transition to making the topping which is more Nutella goodness and this is one of the reasons that it's good to definitely have your pan greased because it does it is going to want to stick now we transition into making the topping which is super easy just a bit more Nutella some chocolate tips and a little bit of shortening and we're going to heat that up as well tablespoon of shortening chocolate chips which is half a cup and that's the milk chocolate chips and more Nutella we are using another cup of Nutella once the mixture is melted you are pouring it on as evenly as you can and then you can always use a spatula if you need to to spread it out your final step is going to be putting this in the fridge and then of course waiting for everyone in your house to get home and devour them once you're done with this step you are putting the entire entire tray into the refrigerator for about an hour so everything can harden on its own then chocolate hardens on the top chocolate and Nutella that is hardens on the top and then once you take it out you can cut it into squares I would make them smaller squares because it is a very rich dessert and your family will definitely enjoy it thank you as always so much for watching you can always find me on Twitter at Danielle Smith TV and I love when you comment below let me know what you think and I'm always looking for other desserts to make so if you've got a favorite or you have a favorite with Nutella I'm always looking for new ones to make there so again thanks for watching and into the fridge we go you", "vD_0T8nTg_Y": "today I will be making rice krispie treats I'm

we make recipes with just three ingredients I was supposed to have a co-host today but he may be a little bit late tends to be a little bit late hello Patrick ah there is Herschel do you remember Herschel from when we made turtles hello how are you I'm doing okay that's grand I'm here with my special hat I I see you're wearing a santa hat yeah I figured it would be a good thing to do for your Christmas episode Oh Herschel I'm sorry but the Christmas episode well that happened before Christmas it's now New Year's do you mean I'm late again yeah you're a little bit late can we just call me early for next Christmas I think so I think that you're 300 and something days early for Christmas yay so Herschel I thought that today we would make a really quick recipe what do you think why'd you have me for the quick recipe well I figure if we do a quick recipe you slow you are a little slow but then it might even out okay let's do it then ok so today we're going to do rice krispie treats you've heard of those yeah they're really chewy takes a long time to aid them yep they are chewy and they're very sweet and we are going to add one new element to them to make them a little bit more grown up and it takes a little bit of time to do that it's a brown butter have you heard of brown butter and I know the yellow butter yep this is you sounds the white butter but right you start with yellow butter or white butter and then you put it on the stove for a long time and it turns to a nice brown nutty salty consistency and that's going to just elevate these rice krispie treats to a little bit more of a grown-up flavor what do you think I'm Nadia butter what what a people are allergic to nuts oh no there's no deaths in it at all I just schleck not exactly okay so the first of our three ingredients is of course Rice Krispies you don't have to use this brand you can use any sort of puffed rice cereal you can get it in a large size because you're going to be using quite a number of them you're going to use six cups of rice krispie treats or rice cereal snap crackle pop that's right our second ingredient is marshmallows look at all of them hair that's right you can use four cups of mini marshmallows or just I just use a package of either mini marshmallows or the larger sized marshmallows usually works out to a good ratio with the six cups so it doesn't matter if they're big or small they end up being his chuyia nonetheless it's exactly the same kind of marshmallow so just whatever you prefer or whatever you can find yay and our final ingredient is of course butter butter no no no nuts involve burien folks there are no nuts involved we are going to use four tablespoons of butter that's a half a stick here in the US okay we're going to start off with a large nonstick pan you can use any Pan the butter makes the marshmallows come off a little bit more easily but I find if you start with a nonstick pan you're going to find that the marshmallows just come right out and cleanup will be a lot easier you're going to take your four ounces of butter and just put it in your pan on medium heat you may actually want to go for medium low heat it depends really a lot on your stove my stove is electric so turning down the heat takes a little bit of time for it to cool down so i'm going to start it on medium heat normally with the rice krispies treats all you need to do is melt the butter and then immediately add the marshmallows we're going to make this a little bit slower and it's going to take a little bit more time but it's definitely worth it the butter is going to brown it doesn't mean that it's burning and that's why we're doing this really slowly you actually want to cook the butter pass this yellow phase and it's going to go from yellow to kind of a clear and then it will go to brown you don't want to scorch it you don't want to bring it to brown all at once immediately because that's just burning the what you want is a nice slow nutty flavor it's a little bit salty and it's really just going to add a depth of flavor to these rice krispie treats so take your time be patient wait it out herschel and I certainly know how to wait things out he's a turtle he knows how to take things slow take this browning of your butter slowly it's going to take several minutes but it'll definitely be worth it as you can see we're halfway through the process the butter has gotten really foamy that's good and as you stir it you can see that it's a much more of a yellow color it's kind of hard to tell with the bottom of the pan but as you can see it's foaming up quite a bit now we're going to wait for it to go from this foam enos to a nice brown color again not too dark brown you just really want to caramelize the butter just a little bit now as you can see we have gone from yellow to that foam eNOS there's still a little bit of foaming this up on the top but as you can see we now have this beautiful brown color this is what you want you want it to be this color or slightly darker you can go a little bit darker than this mostly you're going to be able to tell by the smell it definitely smells very nutty very flavorful you're going to want to turn off the heat at this point because if you go past it you're going to start to scorch your butter and that's not what you want immediately upon getting to the brown stage I'm then going to add my one package of mini marshmallows and we're going to melt those to stir this continuously it's going to take a few minutes the marshmallows are going to look a little bit Brown that's because of the brown butter don't panic especially if you have a nonstick pot this is going to just melt down it's not going to stick to the pot it'll just come together and you'll see after a minute or two it will turn into a nice binding material for the rice krispies so once you've gotten to this stage where it's almost completely melted you can almost not see any of the marshmallows left you're going to now add your rice krispie treats and stir them all in together as quickly as you can as you can see this is not a neat process this is a very messy process the marshmallow is now starting to coalesce back together I've lost a few rice krispies that's to be expected with a panda size now as soon as you get to the stage and it's just incorporated we are going to transfer this to a well-greased 9 by 13 glass pan you can't push this down with your fingers what I would admit advise is to spray down your hands with a little bit of cooking spray not too much you don't want to make your hands terribly greasy but you also don't want them to stick to this make sure that it is cooled down just slightly before you start to do this because this can be very very sticky and very hot coat so it can burn you quite badly if it's too hot when you're putting it into the pan now we're just going to wait for this to cool and cut it into squares once your treats have cooled down completely you can then cut them into squares and serve them right away so what do you think herschel how to chew yeah those stick to the roof your mouth a little bit it does let me help you out oh thank you there you go there we go so you'll find that these tastes very much like the rice krispie treats you are used to it's just the brown butter adds a little bit more of a nutty salty element without actually using that without actually using not soon without actually using salt the butter does have a little bit of salt in it and I think that that comes out when you are browning it for the process of this taste just a little bit more grown up but it really little snack you lack is a kid it still is the snack you like as a kid and it's something to bring to maybe your new eat New Year's Eve party or your Christmas party if you're starting early like herschel here yeah I was like so I'm gonna be a little early this time perfect alright Herschel's so this is our very last three ingredients for the year of 2015 what do you think I made it just in time you did you made it just in time remember we're here every Thursday with a three ingredient recipe I'm always joined by a friend this time was with herschel you never know who will show up next won't be me promise well I won't make it enough time oh that's true he shows up when he can and sometimes he starts and we're already done yeah on Tuesdays I talk about growing long hair for men and on weekends our friend George you know George he's the cat he's the cat with the self-esteem right he's the cat who talks about Ogden always interrupts him that like I'm doing to you right now I like that yeah just like that George is here to talk about having good self-esteem so if you like this video please give it a thumbs

loop for my miles let's try ohhh bankie ah there you go I'd better not click went down up there you go there we go I better not just cuz my mouth no that's probably a good idea just keep it just okay yeah maybe", "Zd4lTk9HiME": "[Music] welcome to the second episode of cookie with the summer featuring today we're gonna make a speech all right so what your ingredients are is you can pick any cereal we have two options today butter and marshmallows that's all you need so we're gonna pick between rice krispie treats and Lucky Charms okay which one should we do alright so our next step is we're going to take a 1/4 cup of butter so you're gonna look at your butter stick and you're gonna find one quarter and you're gonna make a cut right there okay go ahead make your cut for us wait wait did she go anywhere good slice it like I just cut it hard slide it like a song drop it oh yeah alright now we're gonna get our pot and we're going to add our quarter cup of butter into our pots okay go ahead put the butter in the pot alright next we're gonna add a whole entire bag ten ounces of marshmallows Bochy might be a little bit messy [Music] alright next you're going to get a parent to help you and you're going to go over to the stove and melt all this together yet you need a parent for this part but lucky for me I am a parent so on medium heat we put our butter in our marshmallow pan here and I'm just gonna slowly circulate which means spin in a circle my butter and my marshmallows until it's melted so make sure you're constantly stirring cuz if you'll see it melts really fast but you do not want your marshmallow to burn so you want to be scraping the bottom and just keep everything moving because it's almost turned into a liquid if you'll look right now there are no lumps left so everything is smooth so at this time you're just gonna take it off the heat so next we're going to add in 6 cups of your favorite cereal so Kate go ahead we're gonna put our cereal in a big bowl so then you just have to look at Kaitlyn ready she's just gonna scoop it out with the 1 cup a nice level scoop and then dump it in so that's 1/2 so pause for a math quiz if we need 6 cups and we've added 2 how many more do we need to make 6 - no - let's do it before we eat 6 so I'm gonna do anything we have to and we need 6 how many more do we need but yes that's 2 plus 4 equals 6 so we have 2 this is gonna be number 3 doubles math back right there three plus three is six sticky sticky mess so now we're gonna mix it all together until a big huge salt yummy goodness really look at this besides one quick tip that miss Butler showed me I did not know my hands were an icky gooey mess when I was trying to spread it and she taught me this you just take a little butter and you rub it on your hands like this and then watch this when you spread it it doesn't come up on your hands because your hands are greasy so that's how I mix a Butler tip for you the next you're going to take your all of your wrist recipes you have in the bin and you're going to welcome in your cake sheet pan like so it's a lot harder guys than you think because bones are need to use your hands a little too so next you're going to add your rice krispies treats in here we're gonna flatten it into your pan I'm a flattening into my belly I don't know the Messier the better so after we're done it should look like this all

comments what should I make with this because it ended up making a good bit of cannabis coconut oil and I'm not exactly sure what I want to use this for and somebody in the comments said rice krispies treats and that actually sounds so good because I have only made rice krispies treat edibles one time before back in Mississippi and they were actually really really tasty so let's go ahead and try to make some rice krispies treat edibles out of this cannabis coconut oil let's get this video started so you're gonna need a few things in order to make a rice krispies treat edible the first thing you're gonna need is cannabis coconut oil or you could use cannabutter you're gonna need five tablespoons to ten tablespoons depending on how many you're making I'm gonna use five tablespoons today because I'm just gonna make a small tray of rice krispies treat edibles the next thing you're gonna need is ten cups of rice krispies cereal you're also gonna need a bag of marshmallows it doesn't matter what size marshmallows you're melting them down like I had a little bit of vanilla extract to my rice krispies treat anibal's just because it helps with the taste it covers up any weenie taste that you'll get from the cannabis coconut oil and lastly you're gonna need some cooking spray let's get to making some rice krispies treat edibles so the first thing you want to do is gather a large pot and then you want to turn your heat to medium heat next you want to add your five tablespoons of cannabis coconut oil let that cannabis coconut oil meltdown once your coconut oil is melted down you can go ahead and add a whole bag of marshmallows go ahead and spray your spatula with cooking spray so that the marshmallows don't stick to it as you stir together the melted coconut oil and the marshmallows you can also add a tablespoon of vanilla at this time [Music] [Music] now that I have the marshmallows melted down you can go ahead and turn off the heat and add your ten cups of rice krispies cereal go ahead and stir that up once you have the rice crispies well incorporate it go ahead and take a cookie sheet and spray it with cooking spray then go ahead and add your rice krispies and marshmallows to that tray once you have it on the tray go ahead and smush it down into a rectangle once you have that firmly pressed into a cookie tray let this sit for about thirty minutes to an hour to solidify and then we will go ahead and cut this and half our rice krispies treat edible a few moments lay down all right 30 minutes later and this has solidified I'm gonna go ahead and take a knife that I've sprayed with cooking spray and cut these and move them to the tray and then we'll try something all right so here we have it my rice krispies treat edibles these are super duper [ __ ] big I just cut them big and dip them really thick but let's go ahead and try one it smells a little weedy like I can smell the weed in it but we'll try it Cheers [Music] okay this this I can taste the wheat him it's not bad like it's still very sweet and still just like a rice krispy treat but that we D aftertaste is pretty strong in this but I advise crispy treat audibles from the dispensary before and they taste exactly the same and they smell exactly the same so I think that's just the nature of working with something like marshmallows that are kind of lightly flavored but it is really really good that like I'm not gonna lie like I'm gonna definitely eat this whole thing [Music] half the size of my have this made 8 large rice krispies treats and a use 5 tablespoons of 80 milligram THC oil so this should have 400 milligrams of THC in all of them and since there's a there's 50 milligrams of THC in each one so it's not what schlong gets notable this is definitely a lower dose but for somebody does not person edibles 50 milligrams kick your ass mmm all right you guys thank you guys so much for watching I guess I'm gonna end this video since all I'm doing is sitting here and eating this delicious rice krispies treat if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below on what I should make with the rest of this cannabis coconut oil I have a little bit

let's follow the journey of rice as it goes from the ground to becoming a bowl of Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal on your breakfast table full of snap crackle and pop my name is Jennifer and I'm a rice farmer my father has been farming for over 40 years and my brother farms so we are a family farm in every sense of the word she's my daughter so you know I'm gonna brag on her Kellogg's uses medium grain rice from our farm for rice krispies we plant rice in the spring it's seated in the dry and when it gets about 5 or 6 Leafs on then we established a permanent flood at that point it'll stay flooded all the way through the season until just before harvest and then we ship it out to the mill the Miller then delivers the clean rice to Kellogg where we turned it into cereals that have been family favorites for generations using simple methods in fact the way we make rice krispies could be envisioned in your own kitchen we take our medium grain rice cook it with sugar salt and malt flavoring and fortify it with vitamins and minerals we then allow the grains to partially dry so when they're rolled out each grain is ready for puffing and from there we deliver it to your bowl it's that simple it's really a neat feeling to think that a family sitting down for breakfast in Oregon or Virginia might be eating my rice in a bowl of rice krispies well you never know what today may

with famous rice krispies treats but today instead of rice krispies treat we're making lucky charm trees so there are only three ingredients for a lucky charm treats obviously lots of charms marshmallows and but now we're doing my favorite part which is putting in the ingredients and melting it all 1/4 cup of butter and 3 cups of marshmallows and that went to be add that all in we will put the pot on medium low heat so we could have been incorporated all right everyone now we are going to turn the pot on medium low heat and then stir until it is not so nicely everything starts melting I'll start mixing this is my first time that ever doing something over the stove to be honest with you guys here's what you could tell that the butter started melting the marshmallows are sticking to it now so now it's melting real nicely make sure you keep stirring through the cooking process do it so I'm just gonna pour this in real quick and that's butter and marshmallows and Lucky

something that takes you down memory lane back to your childhood keep watching this chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats recipe is really easy here in this pot I have half a stick or four tablespoons of butter here I have half a cup or 130 grams of creamy natural peanut butter the Noster kind I know it's in a 1/4 cup measuring cup honestly it is now midnight I have had neither lunch nor dinner and I think the hunger pangs are clouding my judgement so that is why that happened here I have three and a half cups of chocolate puffed rice cereal the original recipe for the plain peanut butter rice krispies treats calls for 160 grams of puffed rice so I did the same with this chocolate puffed rice which came out to be 3 and 1/3 cups on the box it says that one cup is 42 grams but when I poured it it was 48 so really three and a half maybe three and a third cups of chocolate puffed rice cereal and then I have 10 ounces or 283 grams of miniature marshmallows what I'm going to do is I'm going to melt the butter once it's almost completely melted I'm going to add the peanut butter and then stir that in when it's almost completely melted I'll add marshmallows and once they're almost completely melted I will add the chocolate puffed rice mix it well until it's combined and then pour everything into this buttered 8x8 dish also it's a good idea to make sure that your spatula and spoon whatever you're using to stir and handle the chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats are buttered as well this can get kind of sticky so as you can see the butter is almost completely melted it's been maybe one or two minutes over medium heat I was going to put in peanut butter once again half a cup 130 grams and then I'm going to stir this in so that it is melted as well it's been probably not even a minute on medium heat gas mark 3 out of 6 I'm going to add my 10 ounces or 283 grams of miniature marshmallows when you keep stirring so everything melts and combines well so now it's been 2 to 3 minutes I would say I've been stirring constantly now what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn off the heat pour in the chocolate puffed rice and stir everything together it looks like it might not combine but just keep stirring bring everything from the bottom up to the top so I just finished mixing in the chocolate puffed rice cereal I actually added in 30 more grams of cereal because it looked a little too wet so I would make that a total of 190 grams I'm saying four cups like I said it looked a little too wet and loose so I'm gonna pour this into the dish and let it harden also you're gonna have to scrape the bottom a little bit but trust me it'll turn out once the mixture is in the pan use a spatula or even your hands to shape it so it forms a smooth single layer and then let it rest for five to ten minutes before serving however since it was after midnight and I still hadn't eaten neither luncheon or dinner I had to dig in and I'm glad that I did because these chocolate peanut butter rice krispie treats were phenomenal while they were still warm if you like chocolate and peanut butter you will absolutely love these just like with the rice krispies treats with the peanut butter and the regular puffed rice cereal these chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats had an excellent combination of not only flavors but also textures the sweetness of the chocolate cereal and the marshmallows balanced very nicely with the savory flavor of the peanut butter the peanut butter flavor itself coming through loud and clear the combination of gooeyness and crisp eNOS was delicious as well although these chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats looked a bit loose when I cut them Wednesday I had a few more minutes to setup they held their shape pretty well as you can see I suggest serving these rice krispies treats with a tall cold glass of milk although some people might want to end chocolate chips to this recipe I'm gonna say even though I did not try it I'm going to say that it might be a little too much too much sweetness and in terms of the texture it might throw off the gooey crispy balance that is really just perfect in this however I do think that some pieces of peanuts would be good so if anyone makes these chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treats and adds chocolate chips or any other additions let me know although the original version of this recipe is definitely good I'm gonna have to say that I prefer the chocolate peanut butter rice krispies treat version if you've never made any of my recipes and you like chocolate and peanut butter dessert recipes be sure to give this one a try thanks for watching if you like this video please be sure to like share comment and subscribe for more

a couple of our favorites this summer and that inspired us to make a treat version of those two things so to make your rice cereal treats you're gonna need butter crispy rice cereal marshmallows and an eight inch cake pan and then to decorate those treats to make them look like watermelon and sweet corn we have candy melts here and i have green pink and yellow and we have some chocolate chips some wax paper and you're gonna need a paint brush or two the first step to making rice cereal treats is heating a fourth of a cup of butter over medium heat and now that our butter is melted you can add in your marshmallows we're gonna mix that all together you're going to want to mix it until it reaches a gooey consistency you're going to add in 6 cups of crispy rice cereal then mix it all together we're going to put half of this mixture into our greased 8 inch pan you're going to take some wax paper set it on top and press it in and making sure you get a nice even layer i'm going to spray my hands to make it easier to handle them and we're going to make these into our corn cobs so you're going to take pretty good sized ball so we're just going to shape this into a corn shape so you're going to want to roll it until it's a little bit long and then at the ends on one end you're going to want to make it round and on the other end you're going to want to pull it out a little bit i hold a nub and now you have a little corn on the cob you should be able to make about four of those with the remaining cereal treats so now we're gonna heat up our candy melts and candy melts our little candy pellets that you melt and you can use to cover things dip things or drizzle and we're going to use them as our paint so we're going to heat them up by putting them in a bowl and putting them in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time and then you're going to take it out and stir it and you're going to try to get all of the lumps out as you can after you've stirred it well you're going to put it in for another 30 seconds and stir it and we're going to do that for our pink and yellow too so now that all our pellets are melted it's pretty thick so we're going to want to thin that out to be able to use it as paint we're going to add a little bit of vegetable oil and you really don't need that much at all and then mix it up and now it's thin enough to use as paint our little corn cobs the le shaped have cooled and set and i popped this crispy treat out of the 8 inch round pan and i'm going to cut that into sections so i'm going to it i'm gonna take each half and cut that into thirds so at this point it becomes an edible craft project because we're going to be painting our crispy treats so i have a watermelon slice ellie has a corn cob we have our paint brushes and we have our candy melts that are warmed up to that paint consistency so we're just gonna start painting them [Music] so we have our tasty crispy treats and then we painted them with the candy coating and you add a couple chocolate chips on there and these are going to be delicious [Music] [Music]", "zqspUDzr6Xk": "  Hi Bold Bakers! I know it is back to school time but I am\ngoing to brighten up your day with my no bake granola bars. They are perfect for lunchboxes and afternoon\nsnacks. So here\u2019s what\u2019s fantastic about these\ngranola bars. We\u2019re going to make one base recipe and\nthen from that, you can make any flavor you want. I\u2019m going to show you some of my favorites\nbut first we\u2019re going to make the base for our granola bars. So in a large bowl, we\u2019re going to add in\nsome oats. Rolled oats or quick cooking oats work perfectly. Into the oats, we\u2019re going to add in some\nRice Krispies. Generally, I always have these in my house. So those are the simple dry ingredients for\nthe base. Now we\u2019re going to move onto the wet ingredients. So into another bowl, we\u2019re going to add\nin some butter, brown sugar, if you don\u2019t have brown sugar you can use white but brown\nsugar is preferable, and then some liquid sugar. I\u2019m using honey, you can use agave, maple\nsyrup, any liquid sugar. So our next step is to pop this into a microwave\nor you can put it into a small saucepan and you want to let it simmer up for around 2\nminutes. It will create a nice caramel and then we\u2019ll\nput that onto our dry ingredients. So our little caramel is out of the microwave,\nsmells delicious. So to this, you want to add in a little bit\nof salt. Salt helps to bring out all the lovely flavors\nof the ingredients you\u2019re going to put into it. We\u2019re also going to add in a little bit\nof vanilla extract. Now this is optional just in case you don\u2019t\nhave it or you don\u2019t want to add it in, but it does add a lovely bit of flavor and\na nice little kick to your bars. Just want to give that a little mix in and\nthen pour it straight over our oats and our rice. Look at that, gorgeous. Once your caramel is in there, you want to\ngive it a good mix until it all comes together. And there you go, this is the base for our\nchewy granola bars. It actually takes no time to make at all. Oh it\u2019s so yummy, the texture is really\nnice, I can taste the little bit of salt and vanilla. Now I\u2019m going to show you how you can turn\nthis into a lot of different flavors. We are going to start out by making a nut\nand raisin bar. Into my granola bar base, I\u2019m going to add\nin some toasted chopped nuts. Now here I am using almonds because I love\nalmonds but you can use any kind of nut that you like. Make sure that they\u2019re toasted because they\ngive such a better flavor. Next is our dried fruit, I\u2019m using raisins. Dried fruit is high in nutrients because there\u2019s\nno water. They\u2019re even more dense so they\u2019re really\ngood. And then lastly I\u2019m going to add in some\nunsweetened coconut. I adore coconut. And then give that a big mix around, make\nsure that everything gets combined well. These granola bars are fantastic when you\nneed a boost of energy after school, for lunch, whatever it is. Oats are great because they\u2019re full of energy\nand they\u2019re slow-releasing so they\u2019ll keep you going throughout the day. That\u2019s it, all mixed up. And as you can see, no baking, no machines,\nall done by hand in minutes. So now I\u2019m going to put this mix into a\ntray. Line a small tray with parchment and then\njust pour in your granola. This might seem a little bit dry but what\nyou\u2019re going to do is press it into the tray. You can feel then how sticky it is, also it\nfirms up when it goes cold and that\u2019s how you get those nice bars. You might want to use a spatula or a pallet\nknife and just press it in nice and firm to get an even layer. I like nice, thick bars but you can spread\nthis out further if you\u2019d like. And in true bigger bolder baking fashion,\nI\u2019m going to sprinkle some more ingredients on top. A few toasted almonds and some raisins. And then give those guys a little bit of a\npress down. Our granola bars are looking great and they\u2019re\nsmelling great but now it\u2019s time to pop them into the fridge and let them set. It takes around 2 hours. Now you\u2019ve got to have a peanut butter and\njelly granola bar considering this is back to school. It\u2019s really really easy to make, the only\ndifference is, into your wet mix of butter, brown sugar, and honey, we are going to add\nin some peanut butter. You can use smooth or chunky, whatever you\nlike. You also don\u2019t have to use peanut butter,\nyou can use any nut butter. And then just give him a mix in until he kind\nof just melts into the ingredients. And then like before, pour your wet into your\ndry. Into this bar, I\u2019m also going to add in\nsome toasted peanuts. Give it some nice extra texture, a little\nbit of bite. And then just mix it all together. You guys have been requesting granola bars\nI\u2019d say since I started the channel. So it\u2019s definitely about time that I made\nthem. So what you should do if you\u2019re a smart\nbold baker, is make these over the weekend when you have time and then you can eat them\nfor your snacks, for your lunch, all the way throughout the week. So we\u2019ve got our peanut butter in here but\nlet me show you where the jelly comes into it all. So go ahead and scoop half of your peanut\nbutter mix into your prepared tray. Press it down with your spatula until you\nget a nice, thin layer. So then for my favorite part, the jelly. Choose any kind of jelly you want, it\u2019s\nup to you. I usually have raspberry or strawberry. And then we\u2019re going to do a very thin layer\non top of these oats. Just spread out your jam until it\u2019s a nice,\neven layer. Once your jam is on there, then go ahead and\nput on the rest of the oat mix. Be careful not to squish down too much so\nyour jam doesn\u2019t come out. If your jam is a little bit runny, you can\nalways pop your tray into the fridge as well and let it set before you put on your other\nlayer. To add a little bit of something to these\nbars, I\u2019m going to sprinkle some more chopped toasted peanuts on top. Just as I\u2019m finishing up these bars, if\nyou haven\u2019t subscribed to my channel, make sure you do so. We\u2019ve got new mug meals coming soon and\nwe also have fantastic holiday recipes coming up so you don\u2019t want to miss out on any\nof them. Ok that\u2019s it we\u2019re done. I can see some jam coming out of the side\nthere. This guy is ready for the fridge. So another delicious granola bar is double\nchocolate. Sounds like heaven. It\u2019s really easy, all you want to do is\ninto your wet ingredients very similar to peanut butter, we\u2019re going to add in some\ngood quality, unsweetened cocoa powder. And then just give it a good mix in. And then straight into your dry ingredients. And then for extra chocolate, because no one\nwill say no to that, I like to add in some chocolate morsels. Make sure that they are good quality. And then just like the others, just mix them\ntogether until everything is combined. Sometimes these mixes seem a little bit dry\nbut just keep mixing until all your oats are hydrated, everything is covered in a delicious\nlayer of yumminess. And remember all of my recipes along with\nother snack ideas can be found on biggerbolderbaking.com. Ok this is well-mixed, it\u2019s nice and stiff. Now we\u2019re just going to press it into our\ntray. And then just press it down evenly all the\nway to the edges. And then because you can never have enough,\nI\u2019m going to sprinkle more chocolate chips on top. It\u2019s funny, this granola bar reminds me\nof when you go to a birthday party in Ireland and you get rice crispy buns, and all they\nare is rice crispies and chocolate, that\u2019s what this tastes like. So this guy now is ready for the fridge. My granola bars have been in the fridge for\na few hours, they\u2019re nice and firm. So now I\u2019m going to cut them so you can\nhave a look. Cut them into whatever sizes you like. Remember that they are filling so they don\u2019t\nhave to be huge. The granola bars stay fresh in an airtight\ncontainer for up to five days. You can put them in the fridge or leave them\nout at room temperature. Since I just made the chocolate one, I\u2019m\ngoing to give that one a taste. It is rich and decadent and chocolatey. This is gorgeous and the best thing about\nit is there\u2019s all these lovely oats in there, the rice, great ingredients. They are a great way to start your day, end\nyour day, or any time in between. Share your granola bar photos with me on social\nmedia using the hashtag #boldbakers. And I\u2019ll see you back here next week for\nmore Bigger Bolder Baking.", "WwmOl4nJrZM": "[Music] today we're going to be making rainbow rice krispies treats all you need for this recipe is

today we're going to answer the age-old question does it really matter is it important to use the name brand or can you get away with the cheap old store brand we're gonna make wrench miss Patrice that's another whole video and it is coming because this is 12 ounces and that is 12 ounces ah they're exactly the same but for how many grams see 40 grams 21 grams see they lie all the time oh they're the same thing or are they let's find out my spatula my eggnog this is going a little faster than mine just a little I think it's because Tami's burner is hot as bigger than mine and she's got a bigger pot than mine I think it's because I've got the good brand it could be mine these are mine mine oh [Music] [Music] hey not supposed to eat it yet [Music] this is the [Music] well that settles it the name-brand rice krispies treats are decidedly better they really are they're crunchy err the marshmallow seems to kind of cope better these are the rice krispies themselves are kind of flat and they're a lot more holy and they don't and that may be the marshmallow doesn't cling as much I don't know those are better oh no it is not okay well we'll agree to disagree anyway thanks for watching I hope you found this entertaining and don't touch me with your sticky fingers and we'll see y'all next time [Music] you", "Ih-h0tYhj5M": "I've enjoyed the marshmallow that was sitting there before you got it here at every university we used to fish out the all the marshmallows and then we would just eat the charms I'm assuming this has a lot of sugar no I think it's made of all-natural Oh God sugar sugar golden sugar my favorite stuff what really shiny here I don't know how I feel about that marshmallows looked kind of fake they look almost plastic I would totally eat these it is like a rice krispie square so let down yeah I'm actually really disappointed okay can we talk for a minute about what the natural taste of good luck would be I have a lot of answers cinnamon toast crunch treats sure mine is all-natural and that's all artificial this looks like candy I don't think this is something kid should be eating sugars alcohols might have alcohol it's both an afternoon snack and a cocktail well there's actually just like the cereal something like what cereal I disagree it is just like the cereal this one cinnamon toast crunch definitely yeah I don't like the cinnamon toast crunch cinnamon toast crunch absolutely like charge Golden Grahams this is what I'm talking about I'm super happy about this look at that it's like a chocolate bar no you choose like the cereal well I take it back I want Golden Grahams I still like my Golden Grahams it's not chocolaty enough or marshmallow a no or golden enough time it's quite golden yep winner kids don't eat this give it all to me instead", "7x74dCobN8Y": "good evening YouTube voltar to review back here again with another review I got two more General Mills cereal bars Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms these are the big bars a king size so hopefully I get some ample flavor in these starting off with Lucky Charms serving size is one bar at 200 calories 6 grams of fat 36 grams of carbs and 2 grams of protein so you get a pretty big bar for 200 calories oh my word it's sticky there it is not too many marshmallows but it looks like there's like a white fudge on the bottom crisping very chewy immediately get that Lucky Charms taste little hint of vanilla in there marshmallows add sweetness but no texture at all in fact they completely mesh with the coating that's holding this together I like the glaze that's on the bottom I wish there is more of it this has just the right amount of sweetness for Lucky Charms this is an outstanding bar 94 out of 100 they can improve by adding more marshmallows finding a way to differentiate them from the the glue they used to hold this together so they stay crisp and a freezer dried like the cereal that you buy in the box I like the texture the cereal bar itself just the marshmallows are throwing me a little bit now we're gonna move on to the cinnamon toast crunch serving sizes one bar at 60 grams to 250 calories 7 grams of fat 45 grams of carbs 2 grams of protein click on the love cinnamon toast crunch again it's a big bar 250 calories that could be a decent breakfast here oh look at that color I smells amazing nice chew but you still get a crispness room of cereal immediately get hit with cinnamon a little bit of brown sugar sweetness going on it's like they got the milk left over from eating the cereal condensed it down sweetened it with brown sugar made it into a sauce and glued the bar together without flavor is magnified it's amazing online complaint is not quite as crisp as the actual cereal it's a little softer but the flavor is magnified and I love the brown sugar this gets a 98 out of 100 they can approve just by making it a little more crispy this is an outstanding cereal bar I will buy this again this is the best cereal or iPad my word get yourself General Mills Cinnamon Toast Crunch treats King size this is the breakfast for you but if you want to see more cereal board reviews just comment down below and I'll make them happen

rice krispie squares so to start off you're going to need four cups of mini marshmallows four cups of rice krispies three tablespoons of butter some pink dye as well as a heart shape cutter now I have a 9 by 13 pan here that I've already greased some butter and I'm going to start off by melting my butter once I have that into a large bowl I'm just going to grease the sides the bowl kind of brushing up the butter so that way my marshmallows don't stick add in all of my marshmallows and then stick that into the microwave doing 30 second intervals and after each interval you really want to stir it up really well get that coating of butter all over those marshmallows and with marshmallows you want to be really careful that you guys don't overcook these because when you do they pop up and they create a big sticky gooey marshmallow mess so make sure you're checking in on them you know they're done when they're nice and melted nice and seamless like this now I'm gonna add my food coloring directly into my marshmallows I've done about half a teaspoon and now I'm going to add in my rice krispies once those are in I'm just using my spatula and just stirring them up just folding over and folding over until you get all of those risk is B's completely covered with your pink goo I'm going to plop that right into my pan and start spreading that out right away so I'm just using my spatula here and I'm just pushing and pulling back and forth kind of really trying to level out all of those rice krispies now I don't have quite enough to fill my whole pan so I decided to kind of push them over to the one side and I'm using a piece of parchment paper to help me get a really nice level surface now right away you want to start cutting out your shapes doing this while they're still nice and soft that way we can remould it and make more I found that this was the best method although you can let them Harden slightly and then cut them out that way you just can't really remove the rice krispies afterwards I'm going to take them out of my pan and plop them onto a piece of parchment paper to dry and just like I said we're going to take off all of those scraps and kind of mold those into a big ball and then flatten that out now it kind of looks like a big risk krispie square Patty but that's okay because we're going to cut out another heart and then do the process again remould those and cut out another heart now I'm going to melt some chocolate I'm just using compound chocolate because I don't have to temper it although you guys can use any chocolate you like just make sure you guys are tempering that properly and again I'm just going to go in 30-second intervals until my chocolate is nice and melted pour that into ziplock bag and I'm just using a cup here to help hold my ziploc bag open and cut off a very small corner and then go back and forth of zigzagging zigzagging making this beautiful chocolate pattern in one direction and then the other direction this is a super fun way to dress up your rice krispie squares give them that little extra bit of special and what is better than Rice Krispies square well I would say rice krispies care drizzled with chocolate I have to say that rice krispie squares is probably my all-time favorite dessert I love them they're so simple but they're so good especially with that little drizzle of chocolate so I hope you guys really enjoyed them as well thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you guys all later bye guys you you", "POEm5EW3a24": "hey everybody welcome back to my channel today we're gonna do a

krispies treats but their cocoa their peanut butter cocoa pebbles Lee peanut butter chocolate Oh cocoa and chocolate same thing but this is the end result they're super yummy and they are super super easy to make the ingredients and tools that you will need for the cannabis rice krispies we are going to be using five cups of rice krispies cereal or you can use the fruity pebbles or like I'm using the peanut butter cocoa pebbles you will need 4 cups of mini marshmallows a half a cup of Cana butter and yes this is a little more than half a cup but I want these to be a little strong so if you want them to be less strong just add less peanut butter you'll need a big saucepan and then you'll need a 13 by 9 pan so step 1 and this is we are going to be melting our hot cup peanut butter it's super important that you don't burn your peanut butter so I would keep it on medium depending on your range once your peanut butter is melted you're going to add your marshmallows I typically don't do this all at once just because it kind of makes it a little more difficult our marshmallows have been cooking for about 3 minutes this is the consistency we want so next we're going to add in our cereal oh I forgot to mention you want to turn your heat down before you add your cereal and just like the marshmallows it's best to add it in a little at a time you just want to mix everything up really well once we have this all mixed up really well we are going to put it in the 9 by 13 grease pan with rice crispy cheese okay once they are all mixed up really well and kind of starting to get gooey and stick together it's time to put it in the pan once you get it in the pan just get it all level warm if you want or if you don't decide to eat this all in one today just keep it covered and you know what I like about these these are what I like to get up in my good little late nights yeah I hope think of like sleep oh you recording it yes I wanted to see how they were are they are they yummy delicious absolutely you know I think I want to bite definitely oh I agree", "YxuWBleZb5c": "[Music] alright alright alright welcome to another episode of Toronto guy cooks I am the aforementioned Toronto guy and I will be cooking stuff today I felt like doing something sweet in Jacques Lee chocolate tea Dan deserty somebody on Facebook I know who it is they don't either name mentioned they got enough freaking attention whoring on my channel they posted a video of like I know if it was from BuzzFeed or tasty or whatever of like a certain type of dessert and I remember back in my real name Facebook page people would post those things and that people relieve comments oh look see just they make it look so easy they must be professionals well I'm not a professional I'm gonna show you today how to make some amazing chocolate peanut butter cup rice krispie squares yes you heard me right we've got seven cups of a TBD marshmallows we've got seven cups of name-brand Kellogg's Rice Krispies we've got you'd be careful lifting this up because there's a lot of them we've got ten lovely name-brand Reese's peanut butter cups we've got some got half a cup nice of you it's this is about more this is obviously more than half a cup it's probably about 3/4 cup of regular craft - peanut butter regular and we got some Reese's Pieces which we're gonna garnish with we're also gonna drizzle some melted chocolate on top let's start baby alright we're gonna start with about 6 tablespoons of butter we're gonna melt the butter in this pan on low like meat/meat low medium like in between low and medium we're gonna melt you want to go slowly and then we're gonna continue from there I'm very excited but you know what's unfortunate as I mentioned before man I mean like I unfortunately have to consume all of this buy my on my own because damn it everybody I've offered because I've made this before I've made this before back when I was on my real name Facebook I made this pictures and surprise surprise the comments oh my god I need some I wants and I bit into that and a lot of these were people from locally and I would be just saying to them okay we'll just if you want some I did make a whole bunch it's just me if you want some pick a time and a place where we can meet up and I can give you some and there we go for free it's not like I'm being it wasn't like I was being like ooh you're a hot female you want some of my food why don't you uh tell me where you live I'll come deliver some what we can do intercourse no I was like hey you want to meet at a freaking traffic intersection on a corner I'll hand it off there you go enjoy just tell people that it was awesome but nobody wants to leave the house what are you gonna do so I written what's up unfortunately offer me all the ladies could have had this I mean it's the weekend right now I could have like made this now which I'm making now headed to a girlfriend's place or whatever with this but no because they didn't feel they needed to put the effort in to proven to Toronto guy that they are worth Toronto guys time because I sure as hell tried to prove to them that I was worth their time but Oh what you gonna do you want putting the effort then you don't deserve awesomeness and since I'm putting an effort well you've seen my cooking videos I'm putting an effort and you've seen the awesomeness awesomeness is a result of effort so that's a little tip for all you ladies and dudes out there if you want an awesome relationship listen to all the make towels look at listen to this  guy used to be make 10 now he's a hey if you want an awesome whatever life it's gonna take some efforts nothing's gonna come strollin to you stop being so lazy alright our butter there's a salted butter by the way you can use regular butter of course it's all melted nicely let's now add our 7 cups of mini marshmallows baby still on low heat we're gonna stir it nicely until all of it is combined and melted into a nice thick yet smooth pasty marshmallowy buttery goodness baby let's fast-forward to that point okay so a marshmallow mixture is looking and smelling amazing it's just about done I'm gonna do something real quick that's that this is it oh man this oh well it's too big big deal it's only a little bit of water what I'm doing is gonna be melting the chocolate now of course the chocolate bit is optional the drizzle there's a couple different ways you could melt the chocolate you can either just put it into a little microwave safe Bowl and like cook it cook it if you will on like 30-second intervals intervals turn stirring it every 30 seconds or if you don't want to get that you know awesome microwave sticky film on top you can do it this way I put a little bit took a pot medium sized pot put us put some water in it we're gonna do and the end of obviously a clear safety safety bowl we're gonna do is gonna turn it on just a little bit of water but enough that it'll act as a heat conductor because when it's gonna start boiling we don't need to actually need to heat it right now or maybe we do damn and I need to work on my timing but what it's gonna do is it's gonna slowly melt the chocolate which we're gonna drizzle on top wolf well which which I'm going to drizzle on top of my chocolate peanut butter cup rice krispie squares that's right so let's now let's turn it up to maximum we'll add our chocolate chips and coconut oil so now the marshmallow mixture is pretty much good looking awesome great thing about this if you want to get creative you can add your own little touches to it which i think i'll do right now let grab some let's grab a little bit of vanilla extract man why not and I have to sneeze yeah there we go you only need a little bit with vanilla extract is just so frigging concentrated and powerful you only need a little bit so we only need it that much give it another little mix yeah baby oh man the smell vanilla and marshmallows oh oh it smells like man it smells like you know it like if there was a a female here and I was making this her you know what this stuff smells like it smells like that female would be giving me a reach-around right now holy moly because you know females love this kind of stuff that's what like that's what like movies and stuff taught me all right so that's that it's all good gonna add our peanut butter half a cup I just probably bout 3/4 a cup of whatever wanna have some nice peanut buttery flavor and awesomeness we're gonna melt this down still keep it in on medium-low I'm gonna combine it you see this this easy people it's this friggin easy to make something like this dudes out there like even even the mick tout dudes but the make town dudes who aren't like you know just completely lost that's the only word I can use for it me and your be I understand the anger but bloody hell man it's not a good way to live like it's so easy you make this then you don't have to prove nothing to the ladies man you go out and date them on a first date you show up with this and you'd be like here's here's proof that I'm awesome now I'm gonna sit here and you show me and prove to me why you deserve my chocolate peanut butter cup rice krispie squares damn it alright let's combine it keep stirring oh now the smell of peanut butter is punching me in the face like an angry ex-girlfriend finding out that I made this for somebody else alright love it love it love it okay listen to all these like anecdotes or whatever that Toronto guys coming up with because I'm awesome alright looking good how's this looking it's warm peanut butter stuffs looking good we're about to add our s crispy squares love it love it alright I mean our arrest Krispies and our squares we're making squares you stupid idiot alright let's get let's get our chocolate chips ready gonna use a little bit of Hershey's chip it's not gonna use the whole bag don't need too much let's toss that in there that's good enough about half a bag just to make sure it doesn't all burn and mess up we're gonna add about a tablespoon of coconut oil there we go love it love it and we're just gonna keep stirring every now and then until it melts and become super awesome how's our peanut butter doing oh that's ready it's good oh boy it's good as I say it can add even more your own little tricks and preferences and ideas to this man because don't just be like I want to make the same stuff Toronto guy makes and do exactly what he does because I have no uh no creativity you know be creative man add your own stuff he'll let me know what you did to add to it and if it sounds awesome maybe I'll try that same thing next time I won't give you any like any acknowledgement because you know I'll probably forget who you were but still the points the main thing is you're a somebody and you're special look at that chocolate melting baby milk chocolate use dark chocolate use whatever you want all right now seven cups of name-brand rice krispie squares cereal rice krispie squares see Rice Krispies cereal you stupid idiot into the pan we're gonna mix it all up until it's combined it's gonna get thick it's gonna turn into a big ball of bland awesome let's do that baby let's do that all right so our rice krispies mix is pretty much done our chocolate is melted look at the melted chocolate look at it Oh like those commercials man of the chocolate bars look at it slowly drizzling into the bowl I want some chocolate well I'm gonna get some chocolate and peanut butter and rice krispies and marshmallows and vanilla and butter and racist pieces all right so heats off the chocolate mixed the water the pot is on low now don't want to burn it but we want to keep it melted and warm now the next next phase we're gonna put it all in here one of these you can use a metal one you can use a plastic one use cooking spray bottom line is you want a nonstick surface so that could be cooking spray or what I'm using here is parchment paper also known as you know wax paper don't have to spray it nothing as cheap at the dollar stores and it just comes off easily like easy easier than a band-aid baby easier than demanding all right now we're gonna start layering because what we're gonna do is we're gonna put one layer of this on the bottom put the all the peanut butter cups in the middle and then add the rest drizzle the chocolate sprinkle with the rice krispies I mean sorry Reese's piece of stuff there we go that's good let's take it off the heat that's lovely all right let's start the you want a half the mixture let's just round it off pretty much half the mixture for the bottom layer all right love it love it love it oh this is gonna be so awesome man because I've made it before and I know so all right and I said man experiment you don't like maybe maybe you like Rice Krispies spares but you don't want maybe you have a peanut allergy and if you eat peanut butter breast krispie squares you'll literally die hold it then don't add that add like try like he'll like a tribe chocolate mint add mint extract instead of peanut butter add some chocolate chocolate mint six berry man have a good time because that's what cooking is all about unless of course you're a constant whiner who's like I slaved all over a stove for you people and you don't appreciate me it's like yeah well come on man who did the majority of the work in all honesty you are the stove right you sat there and you stirred in your piston mode well the stove did all the work that'd be like a friggin horse racer talking about how ou ran that race and I put all my heart and soul into that race and the guy meanwhile the horse did all the  running bloody hell all right why am I not showing this there's no much room plus the stove is hot so basically put half of it on the bottom and they spread it out as evenly as possible and do that right now we're quick all right so there's the bottom throw it's not fully all the way out to the edges because we don't we're not using enough ingredients to fill the whole edges so don't worry about it all you gotta do is cut a cut cut cut cut you have straight edges there you go look everybody I'm a genius all right so now we're in our peanut butter cups we have ten of them we're gonna spread them out as evenly as possible we're gonna put them upside down and then yeah maybe oh love it love it baby love it forever and seven days [Music] mmm there we go of course you can always use more peanut butter cups this was a 10 pack so I just got the 10 pack man could have used 20 man though it'd been even awesomer I'd have two women here giving me a reach-around all right that's that now you if you were like me you might worry you might be thinking wow but isn't like all of it like the thick marshmallow peanut butter mixture won't just destroy the rest cream how can the rice krispie squares hold up no rice krispies at least the name-brand ones that are surprisingly strong they don't crush while you're mixing this it's awesome all right now we're gonna add the second layer over this there we go it's on top now we're gonna spread it make it all nice and even as possible again now like the peanut butter cups are probably gonna crush a bit obviously but bloody hell they're buried in between everything so who cares there's people out there who will come up with ridiculous excuses to not do man I can't make those peanut butter cup rice krispie squares because the peanut butter cups get all crushed when you put them in the middle and layer them on top well it's like who can see that idiot like get it out of your mind bloody hell stop complaining everybody's complaining about stupid stuff man stop complaining about pointless drivel all right you have bested cover you see the rice krispies marshmallow makes it so thick and awesome it can't even cover this this degenerate peanut butter cup over here right here being a degenerate but that's all fine and good man because damn it like who cares my hands gonna taste good bottom line it's gonna taste so awesome going in and it's gonna feel so awesome coming out oh that was a poop joke all right so flatten it looks like this one's not gonna get covered but what I'm gonna do we're just doing it real quick all right now I'm gonna take some of our melted chocolate yeah baby now you can obviously just dump it all over and paste it all over up which I've done before this time I'm gonna just like you know go like this just random oh it was supposed to be a random oh well I guess we're just gonna spread it all over them way to go see what I plan to do is just like random drizzle lines and zigzag but see I'm not I'm an artist but I'm not that kind of artist damage gonna dump it all in let's spread it I guess we use the chocolate to hide that degenerate peanut butter cup so I guess it's better to do it like this but ultimately the plan was to was to be zig zaggy and just lines all over the place or like that Nouveau cool look you know but it's still gonna be awesome all right just spread it around like spreading icing on a cake ah yeah baby love it love it love it and we're not done yet we're almost done I mean you could be done if you decide to just say that this is enough but this ain't enough for Toronto guy you see I'm on a mission to show people awesomeness I'm on a mission for many things I want to show people awesomeness I want to show they can do anything I want to show that there's no point in being pissed off about pointless every day all day and I want to show all those ladies that look at all this stuff that you missed out on dammit oh let me lick this mmm tastes like chicken all right now we're gonna do we're gonna take some Reese's Pieces and we're going to crush them in the little Magic Bullet cup here and we're gonna sprinkle them on top so let's do that you damn it see I'm shaking because I'm so frigging excited this smelling so good it's looking awesome I'm very excited there we go that's probably enough that's that all of us do all plenty man it's a big-ass box but you probably owe the same amount as you do in a standard box way to rip people off way to go Reese's you're a giant failure of a company all right now let's mix it all up crush it all up for the final phase well the second final phase I guess let's do it you know can't it's not crush all perfectly there's still some big bits it's like a it's like what the blizzards at Dairy Queen you'll have the powder they'll have the big chunks you have medium chunks let's just spread it over just just just anywhere damnit hey there's a lot of stuff out there that's considered art that don't look like art so hey this is art alright there we go let's add more than sad more let's add more don't not cover the top too much want people to know what exactly this is all right so that's that it's basically done kind of what we're gonna do now is we obviously we have to let it cool we have to let us sit because we have to cut it up and take the picture so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it in my freezer for about half an hour and then we'll be back right now all right so it's been about 20-30 minutes something thirty yeah it's been thirty look at the clock fool thirty minutes in the freezer it's settled it's all fine it's time now to take our chocolate peanut butter cup rice krispie squares topped with Reese's Pieces onn then remember there's some vanilla in there too I'm gonna take that now we're gonna cut it up we're gonna trim the edges we're gonna cut into nice circles circles squares idiot you see I'm so excited on getting my shapes wrong and then we're gonna take the picture whoo the wool the bottom is still slightly warm but that's fine okay rice krispie squares you know they're supposed to be chewy and soft you know just wanted everything this settle so now what we're gonna do we're gonna start cutting it on up Oh baby oh yeah oh yeah of course you know if you want to be more pretty don't like pulverize all the Reese's Pieces and powders and stuff just put them on there as a whole and there you go all right so let's first start trimming the edges so we have a nice nice shapely square rectangle whatever all right so we have our slab let's take let's leave those bits on because there's no I didn't let me grab something put them somewhere put the edges in here for now but the edge isn't here there you go there you go there you go all right well you see see look at

Oh, no. I thought it was a zombie joke. I was going zombie. Huh. That went differently\nin my head, then. (SINGING) Tall guy, beard,\ntwins, purple hoser. Dude Perfect's in Overtime. Tall guy, beard,\ntwins, purple hoser. Now we're heading\non to Overtime. I should probably address\nthe elephant in the room. Yes, my muscles are bigger. I have been working out. That's not it. Oh, you wanted me\nto talk about it. Oh, OK. Cody had shoulder surgery. He's falling apart. He just had LASIK,\nnow the shoulder. Word on the street is he got a\nnose job while he was in there. I don't think so. Trouble in paradise. We've got a banger of an\nepisode for you guys today. Kicking it off with Top 10-- the\ngreatest candies of all time. Could be controversial,\nbut I'm hoping not. It will be. You guys do get to\neat some of the candy. Yes! That's all I was looking for. Two brand new segments-- Get Crafty, followed\nby Magic Time. And then we round it off\nwith everybody's favorite-- Cool Not Cool. --Wheel Unfortunate. Oh! No! OK, before we dive into\nthat, giveaway for this week. We will be choosing\none lucky winner to receive tickets to the 2020\ntour for you and your family. Wow! All you have to do is text the\nword \"Tour\" to the Dude Perfect phone number, and we will be\nchoosing one lucky winner. For the rest of you, some\ncities are already sold out, so get your tickets now. Hey, congratulations to\nour winners from last time, because there are winners. Here they are. Yeah, OK, let's head to Top 10. Here we go! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen,\nwelcome to this Top 10. Today we are talking about the\nTop 10 candies of all time. I'm going to start\noff with number 10. If you even think for a second\nthat black licorice even deserves a top 50 mention-- Hey, you know what\nI'm going to do? --we're going to have problems? You know what I'm going\nto do for you right now? Talk to me. No, I'm going to\nabsolutely freak out. Throw it. Yes! Typically, this would have been\nin my least favorite candies, but thanks to my good buddy\nCodes, number 10 on the list, Swedish Fish. I agree. Gotta respect it. What a stick. Give it a go. Number 10, there it is. Number nine-- the single\ngreatest movie watching candy. Ladies and gentlemen, Milk Duds. Oh! Number nine. I do like a Dud. There it is. My wife got me on the Duds. OK, I'm sure there's other\nmovie favorites out there, but in my opinion,\nyou can not be Milk Duds at the movie theater. Let's all agree\nthat Tootsie Rolls-- Oh, see ya! --are the worst\ncandy ever invented! Goodbye! Can we just do this real quick? Yep. Yep. Punt it. Throw it. No, no, no! What? I don't know what those are. Orange Slices, Circus\nPeanuts, and Tootsie Rolls! No, no, no! See ya! See ya! They're not in\nthe same category! And then chunk it harder. Yes! [CLANG] Oh! You just spread them forever. Hey, good news,\nCory, there's a lot of Tootsie Rolls on the\nground right down there. Time out. Time out. This is the worst\ncandy of all time. Yeah, they're horrible. Eat it right now. I want you guys to taste the\nworst candy in the world. Black licorice kills this. Punt it! Punt it! Punt it! Punt it! No, I'm not doing it. I won't punt it. I promise I won't punt it. But I'm going to throw\nit against the wall! Oh my-- Everything's going to be OK. Everything's going to be OK. That was excessive,\nand I apologize. Wait. Where's the Fun Dip? I would like to take this\nmoment and apologize to Fun Dip. Fun Dip would have\nmade my Top 10. We had a hard time finding it. We couldn't find Fun Dip. It's sold out? Let's take a moment of\nsilence for Fun Dip. All right, let's move on. Number eight-- can\nI please get there? Yeah. This is the most\nunderrated candy bar in the history of the world. Yeah. Payday. No! What were you saying? Snickers! No, no, no. I think this would\nbe a good time to hit some honorable mentions. Orange Tic Tacs. They're so good. Take a few. Because they're\nnot really candy. They're not candy. It's tough to put\nthem on the Top 10. But who doesn't like these? Everybody likes them. For me, this next candy\nat the number seven spot is a candy that I\nvividly remember the day that it came out. I am in my school cafeteria. I'm going through the line,\nand all of a sudden-- oh my. What is that? Sour Skittles. Oh my goodness! A game changer for the\nSkittles organization. Number seven. Top 10 candy for me, 100% Thank you. Sour Skittles. Number six. I'm nervous about this. I feel like I'm going to\nlose some people here, but I have to be true to myself. This is a unique candy. The packaging is unique. Oh, PEZ. Come on. I love PEZ. I just buy the accessories. Fruity Stripes with\ntattoos on the packages. Put it in there. Sure, it loses its flavor\nin about 10 seconds- 10? Five. --but that's why it\ncomes in packs of five. Not even in the Top 10 gum list. It's not even a candy. It's a gum. Do you want me to remove it? Yes! Punt it. The world wants a\nfake version of me, and that's what\nthey're going to get. What happened to be\ntrue to yourself? It's back up there! Number six, Fruity Stripe gum. We almost got Fruity gum off. I don't care what his list is. I just disagree! I would like to welcome\nyou to my top five by suggestion of Tim Bits,\nthe editor, Sweet Tart Ropes! So good! So good! It's a Nerds Rope\nwithout the Nerds. It's just half as good. Peach Rings-- send them. I need a full send\nfrom everybody. Full send! Send it! Boston Baked Beans? Disgusting! Good bye! Jelly beans? Yeah, send them! Send them! Yes! [CRASH] Oh! Oh! [LAUGHTER] He just threw away 30\nminutes of his time. What about a Toblerone? What is that? Oh, those are high--\npremium candy. First of all, that's\nmy number one. Whoa! Dude, it's up there. And if you don't believe me,\nyou can call my wife right now and ask her. Speaker phone. What's your number\none candy bar? If she doesn't say it, you know\nwhat's happening to this thing. Full send. Full send. I agree. What is my number one\ncandy bar that I love? Easy-- Toblerone. No way! That's insane! No way! I've known him for 15 years. I've never even\nheard of a Toblerone! At number four-- greatest sucker\nin the history of the world-- Caramel Apple Pops. Nearly made my top three. In the number three spot-- Pop Rocks. --we have a three-way tie. Let's buy Cody's support. Nerds Rope. Bang! Number three. I'm in his top six. I'd go on record and\nsay that I've been over 25 yards of Nerds Rope. I would argue that I've eaten\ncloser to 65 yards of Nerds Rope. I can't even throw\nfootball that far. Yeah. That's a lot of rope. You digestive system has\nto hate you for that. Can anyone beat 65\nyards of Nerds Rope? Comment below if you have had\nmore than 65 yards of Nerds Rope. Let me know your distance. Three-way tie third place. We've got two more to get to. Top three candy for me\neasy, no question about it, although I prefer a\ndifferent variety-- Sour Patch Bigs can not be beat. I'll dare say that I've\nhad them at breakfast. OK, to round off the\nthree-way tie at third place, Laffy Taffy. Oh! 100%! Laffy Taffy is like the\ncandy you get at Halloween and you cry. Well, I can't wait to see what's\nin your top five number two. [LAUGHTER] At the number two spot, the\nsingle greatest chocolate candy-- Oh god! You cannot say a word\nuntil you've had one! Open it up and have it\nready, and prepare to all bow down to me at one time. 3, 2-- you already ate it? You prematurely put\nit in your mouth and spat it on the ground. It was not very good. To be a number one\ncandy in the world, you have to have good marketing. Do the words lick the\npop, dip, and shake it mean anything to you? Is that Baby Bottle Pops? Ladies and gentlemen, the\nnumber one candy in the world and the greatest jingle\nfor a single candy item in the history of the\nEarth-- (SINGING) lick the pop, dip it and shake it,\nthen lick it again. It's a Baby Bottle Pop. Baby Bottle Pop. Doesn't even rhyme. Next time, I'm going to\nlet someone else take over the Top 10. Great. Apparently, I'm too\ncontroversial for the world. It's true. And I'm not going to put\ngum in my Top 10 candies. OK? We're doing top\n10 cheeseburgers, but I threw a chicken nuggets. Go clean up the office. Thanks for watching\nTop 10, guys. Let's send it back to the desk. I got some jelly beans to\ngo clean up, unfortunately. [MUSIC PLAYING] These are the most overrated\nold man candy of all time. Hey, guys, the segment's over. Let's move on. Lose the candy. We're headed to a\nbrand new segment that is bound to be one\nof my personal favorites. It's time to Get Crafty. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right, gang, welcome to our\nfirst episode of Get Crafty. Today, the guys will\nbe building a chair. They will have 30\nminutes to build the best chair they can using four 2x4s. These are the community tools\nthat they will have to share. You can only use one at a time. Best chair wins. I'll be the judge. Good luck, gents. Have some fun. 30 minutes in 3, 2, 1. Hit it! All right, let's see. You going-- oh, going\nstraight for the holder. I have zero clue\nwhat I'm going to do. [MUSIC PLAYING] My dad is a\nphenomenal woodworker, and he's going to be very\ndisappointed in definitely me and probably Coby. [MUSIC PLAYING] Is there a power button, or-- Maybe I go with a bench. I'm going to make a bench. The key is to be able\nto sit in it, right? That's the general concept. All right, I just\nwanted to clarify that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Cory's yet to do anything. He's just moving his wood. I'm going to cut something! [MUSIC PLAYING] This is majorly unsafe. That's hard to watch. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] It's going to-- [SCREAMS]. Are we allowed to film this? My first cut was\nnot a clean cut. [LAUGHTER] Guys, he's just standing\nthere looking at his saw. Meanwhile-- He's going backwards! Oh my-- What is happening? He's going backwards! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey! First cut, Coby! [MUSIC PLAYING] Quick update-- it looks like\nCoby's trying to build a raft. [MUSIC PLAYING] We've got hammering. I don't know why\nwe're hammering. We've got screws. That's well on its\nway to being a chair. I'm almost sure of it. Perfect. Setting up perfect. I did realize that this\nis my last piece of wood. Four 2x4s goes by very quickly. All right, so the\nguys think this is all about looks and\nthe structural integrity. This is literally going to\nbe all about durability. I'm throwing them\noff the mezzanine. Best chair, most\ndurable wins the game. [MUSIC PLAYING] I mean, we are still on\npage one of the directions. [LAUGHTER] I have the chair in my\nhead, but executing on it is much harder than I\nthought it was going to be. Really struggling,\nI think I'm going to have to go the nail route. On what Earth is a nail better\nthan a screw in this world? I've been asked that,\nTy, the entire time. Well, the problem is look it\nCory putting in the drill bit. I think that's probably\npart of his issue. [LAUGHTER] Oh gosh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ty's currently\nsitting in his chair. You're sitting in your chair? Ty. Hey. What's up, man? Me too. Hey, can I help you? This thing stinks. No, it doesn't. You just don't know\nwhat you're doing. Unreal. This is unbelievable. Oh, you tighten this part down. No, you just add power. You're on like 2%. There's a power? There's a power on the drill? Oh my goodness! That changes the game. I always knew he was Team Coby! That's my guy. I got to see what's\nhappening over here. What are we doing? Are we building a bench? We said scrap the chair? We're building a bench. So why is this piece way longer? I was going to go through\nthe four legs right here, but I realized\nthat's real wobbly. He's going to fall. And so this is coming\nout here, and I'm going to go leg down there. So you went with the\nthree-legged design? Yeah, a tripod. I can't wait to see it. Oh, this is so good. [MUSIC PLAYING] I could eat off this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, light bulb! [MUSIC PLAYING] Cory's hammering a screw. Coby, if you get stuck,\nhammer the screw. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll be honest. If you told me at the\nbeginning of the day that my chair would look\nthis good at the end, I'd have been thrilled. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh gosh, I almost died. 100 seconds left. [MUSIC PLAYING] What is he doing? I'm adding a foot rest. Gotta get this screw\nin and I'm done. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it! Drop the drills! We can let him\nhammer one more time. All right, you can\nhammer one more. [MUSIC PLAYING] Done! He's done it! [MUSIC PLAYING] Time's up. It's time to judge each\nchair individually. First up, we've got Garrett. There's not a wobbly\nleg on this sucker. Boy, did I start slow but, boy,\ndid I pull it together, huh? Anybody who just\ncomes off the street, they look at that, they\ngo, that's a chair. They will say that's a chair. This is nice. The cuts are exactly straight. I was way over there, but\nhey, Cor, where's your chair? [LAUGHTER] He's done it! He's done it! He's made a chair. Tornadoes frequent Texas often. This is a little\nsimulator test to see what would happen if your chair\ngot thrown up off of a two story balcony. 3, 2, 1. Should be fine. [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] That one's done! Literally every piece is apart! All right, Coby. 3, 2, 1. [CRASH] Oh! [LAUGHTER] [CRASH] [LAUGHTER] The seat is totally fine! Dude, yes! All right, I'm up. See you later, chair. It was fun while it lasted. 3, 2, 1. [CRASH] Oh! Yeah! Not bad! [APPLAUSE] [CRASH] Not bad! Second place is\nguaranteed, baby! In 3, 2, 1. [THUD] Ooh! [SCREAMING] Winner! [THUD] Ooh! Winner! What a performance! Unbelievable! He's done it! Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! [CHEERING] Tyler is your winner! Thanks for hanging\nwith us on Get Crafty. See ya! Hey, who am I? [SAW SOUND EFFECT] [LAUGHTER] Coby using a saw. Next time, I personally think\nwe should go through tool safety before we start. I completely agree. I didn't know you didn't\nknow how to use a saw. Listen. Once I figured it\nout, it felt so right. Before that, it felt so wrong. Is it as bad, though, as\nCory hammering a screw? Probably not. You also don't know\nwhat a chair looks like. Coming up, we have a segment\nthat I have been looking forward to for quite some time. Anybody that knows me well knows\nthat I am a huge fan of magic. Raise your hand if\nyou're huge magic fan. Me too. Huge. It's fake. Everything's fake. You think it's fake? Yeah. What do you guys think this is? Matchbox. This is a matchbox. You want your mind blown? You think magic's fake? Let me show you a\nlittle something. [MUSIC PLAYING] Whoa! What! I know what you're thinking. That doesn't have matches in it. There's plenty of matches\nin there, big fellas. OK? Your fake box was\nbehind your hand. It fell out, and\nall of the things fell out in the\nmiddle of your trick. Can we see that in slo-mo? Play that in slo-mo. If you play it in\nslo-mo, and just people will be more impressed. Guys, I think you need to\nknow we have a real magician downstairs. And so I think that's\nwhere we're going to head. Let's head downstairs\nand get to Magic Time. With a real magician! [MUSIC PLAYING] Ladies and gentlemen, please\nput your hands together. An illusionist, a\nmagician, Harris III. I don't know if I have anything\nthat can top that actual intro. That was amazing. Why don't we do a little bit\nof audience participation right off the bat? Is that cool? Yeah. I might save you for the finale. Let's try something\nelse with you. How would you rate\nyour imagination on a scale of 1 to 10? Oh, I've got a really,\nreally good imagination. OK, I'll tell you what. I need you to choose a card,\na random card that you think no one else would think of. The jack of clubs. The jack of clubs. How crazy would it be if\nthe card that I turned over in this real deck of cards\nis the same one that you turned over in your mind. OK, I'm going to go\nthrough the entire deck just so you can see out\nof all of these cards, there is a single card\nturned upside down. No way! No! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] The jack of clubs. No way! That's good. I don't get it! Well done! I don't think I've ever\ngotten a standing ovation after the very first trick. That was crazy. I love it! Let's try something. All right, Cory, come on up. Come on up. Good luck, Cory. Here's how the game works. I take the paper off. I wad it up into a\nlittle paper wad. Your job throughout the game\nis to guess which hand it's in. Take this, move it down\njust a little bit-- there we go-- so\nit's out of the way. All right, let the game begin. That feels impossible. Left again. Left. Dang it! Give it a little snap. Tap on my hand. Blow. It totally disappears. [LAUGHTER] We'll give it another shot. Here, take this. Roll this back up a little bit. He's trying to look\nat one hand even though I'm waving it around. He won't take his eye off of it. Don't take your eye off of it. [LAUGHTER] What do you think,\nright or left? Get worked, son. Get worked. You got this. Right. Right. Aw! Show me your left. Show me your left. Gone again. Big round of applause before\nyou go back to your seats. [APPLAUSE] Well done. Well done. I need to get one\nof you actually up here on stage this\ntime to help me out. OK. All right, Tyler, come on up. Come on up. Big round of applause for Tyler. Confirm for everyone\nat home there's no weird strings in the\nair or on the stage. OK? All right. All right, that's cool. Tyler, I need you\nto help me hang onto the corners\nof the tablecloth. I'm going to do the same thing\non this side with my hands. If the table moves, I just need\nyou to move with the table. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] His hand's not moving at all. I know you want to look. Have a good look. Lift up the tablecloth. Lift it up so you\ncan actually see. [SCREAMS] OK. All right, let go. Let go. Let go. [MUSIC PLAYING] No way! No way! [MUSIC PLAYING] What! Big round of applause for\nTyler, ladies and gentlemen. I have so many questions. You guys might officially be my\nfavorite audience of all time. Special thanks to Harris\nfor coming out today. To see more of\nhis amazing magic, click the link in the\ndescription below. His YouTube and his Instagram\nhandle will be there. Back to the desk. [MUSIC PLAYING] I know you want to\nclap, but you can't. Let's do a three-way clap. Oh, that's nice. Yep. Coming up is the segment\nwhere people tend to clap, and hopefully I don't\nhave to own a cat. A segment that people think\nis great but we tend to hate. The game show we play but\nwe wish we could delay. Coming up, the game\nshow that we play but we wish we could delay. Why did you just say that again? I already said that. I just wanted it\nto come from me. People think it's great. It's the one that we hate. He tried to mooch his joke. From the middle. Let's go. Wheel Unfortunate. [MUSIC PLAYING] Chad, cue the serious music. And add a big like\nwhen that drops. Like there's a 50\npound weight there. Like Indiana Jones when he\ndoes the stamp in the library, and it's like ... Drop it again. You're going to feel\nthis one in your bones. [BOOM] What's the total\neveryone's spun. I'm just curious. I've only done it once. You've only done one? Yeah, I did the first one,\nI haven't done it since. First one ever, and never again? Yeah. Cor, pick Cody's name out. Pick his name. Pick a name right now. Just do it! Pick it! Get it over with! Pick a name! I keep changing. I changed it like six times. Hot take-- it's Cody,\nand he's owning a cat. Hot take. 3, 2, 1. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] No way! No way! Say it with me, boys. Spin that wheel! I am Ned Forrester, the greatest\ngame show host of all time. Let's bring on our contestant. It's Cory Cotton again! [SCREAMS] So you\nmiss old Ned, and you want to come back on the show. Is that what it is? I'm pretty sure this is five. Five times. And you know what they say-- best friends of five stay alive. I think you know how this works. I don't need to explain\ntoo much about it. You know, I'd give you a Golden\nBoy, but you got five of them. So I went out of my\nway for you this time. The Golden Boy youngin' edition. You know, fun fact, I\nactually wasn't even flexing for this model shoot. I just stood there, and\nthat's what it looked like. So keep that. Enjoy it. Put it on your fridge\nor wherever you keep the rest of your Golden Boys. Hold the mic for me. Cue me in, big fella. 3, 2, 1. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right! OK! Send me to the wheel. Thank you. Go to the wheel now, Cor. I don't even have to\ntell you what to do. You say it for yourself. Spin that wheel. All right, spoken\nlike a true champion. Here he goes. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! Ladies and gentlemen,\nthis is amazing! You're the de-haired guy. You got a stage of 50\nmillion people to influence. What are you going to tell\nthem right now in this moment? Special shout out to\nTeam Cory for hanging with me through the lows. Yeah, I thought it was going\nto be better than that. Say it with me, folks. That's unfortunate. Hey, Cor, see you next time. All right, let's give it\nup for Erica, who will be waxing Cory's pits today. I promise I will never be\nchoosing a name out of a hat again. I want to see what\nwe're working with here. Oh yeah, that's a good amount. That's a good amount. That's a lot. That's three-inchers. Yeah. OK, hop on there, big boy. The table actually\nis really soft. It's really soft. You're going to love that when\nyour body goes into full shock. Bam! Erica, is it safe\nto assume that this is the first time you have ever\nwaxed on a basketball court? Yes, it is. That's good. Oh my-- That one's hairier. That one's hairier. We're just doing it? It's so exposing when\nyou have to just lift it. Right now, I'm just cleaning. That's numbing. That's numbing. You might look better\nwith shaved pits. Yeah, it's not a\ngood look for you. He shaves his chest. Show his chest. Let's do the legs. One knee. We should do a knee. She's going for it. Oh my gosh, she's just doing it. So what's that? There's no turning back now. Oh, it's hot. Walk us through what\nyou're doing here, Erica. So right now, I'm\njust applying the wax. Really? Oh, that's a good amount. Oh, it's over. This is going to be good. All right, Ty. Can I do the rip job here? No! No! No, he can't. Yeah, I can. I can do it. He's not qualified! Yes, he is. I'm totally qualified. No! And what are you doing? No! Erica! Erica only! Erica! Right here? Do it! Just do it! [SCREAMING] We got blood! We got blood! Bad news. Bad news. There's a little piece left. No, no, no, no! Ow! Ow! One down, two to go. OK. You're good. You're good. Oh yeah. We need a GoPro cam. There's a couple more pieces. I don't know. I hate this. One down. Dude, look at the-- This one's hairier, I think. You think so? Yeah. One huge one. A huge glob. This is up there\nwith the eyebrows. Yeah. Yeah. Eyebrows wasn't painful, you\njust looked like a weirdo. Yeah, it was horrible though. Cody's interested. Do it, Cody. I got one good hand. Don't hurt your shoulder. No, no, no, no! [SCREAMING] Yeah. That was the worst! Your technique was horrible! That was not good technique. I did a slow rip. We got to hit it again. Oh wow, I left a lot. We're literally going\nright back in the same spot because Cody did\nsuch horrible job. When the wax goes back over\nthe hurt area, it hurts. I don't have a degree in this. Cobes, you got to get a pull in. Is it fun? Yes. Get a pull. With the wrist. In 3, 2, 1. Oh! I know what you did there! That was good! The pain was in two\ndifferent spots. That was good! I got some leg hair\non the same pull. Thank you, Erica. Appreciate it. No more hair stuff! I'm over that. I love the game show. Cor, I want you to know\nthat I'm proud of you. I also want you to know that our\n2020 tour tickets are for sale, and they're still here. We got them! Oh, that's good!

serial review kinda sorta I mean we still got the sign up in the back we're going with the cereal bars new buy new bag we got the receipt puffs cereal bars we got the golden gram cereal bars and then we got lucky charms cereal bar no we got cinnamon toast crunch eight bars solo martim new pay new bank and some of them don't say knew we wouldn't grab them anyway we gonna try them off because they both are the cereal bars and we're assuming both of them came out almost at the same time and they're both the same thing so we're gonna try them out which one you wanna throw first we're going with the Cerritos Crunch first so I know back in the day they used to have these out I don't know if these are the same exact thing I know for sure these ones are smaller this is like a granola bar size like skinny let's go ahead and crack him in let's see I don't really look like cinnamon toast crunch it's got like a little drizzle and then the bottom has got something on it don't really even say really what it is definitely cinnamon so what'd you think about that one probably the best probably the best you think that's the best it tastes like cinnamon I don't necessarily a little bit like cinnamon toast crunch like if I close my eyes and really wish it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch and then I'll think it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch but if you if you did like a blind taste challenge then if you ate it you would know that it was a cinnamon toast crunch bar but it really doesn't taste like it if you know what it is I don't know what that coating on the bottom some kind of like cinnamon glaze some I don't know but onto the next one Lucky Charms I said this is what it looks like also has some kind of coating on the bottle let's see and this one definitely tastes like Lucky Charms it reminds me of if you made rice krispies treats with Lucky Charms that's exactly what this is tastes like Lucky Charms if you're a fan of Lucky Charms you're definitely gonna dig this one what you just said about it I'll just do say - no Chris meets mellows I mean Shawn oh wait wait wait I don't want to making it tough then go buy this next up we got the Golden Grahams s'mores treats chocolate and body just like a roof tomorrow so this is what it's looking like got the Golden Grahams cereal with the chocolate pieces with the marshmallows and he said the bottoms got the chocolate coating on the bottom let's go ahead and see okay bigot it's alright kinda tastes like a s'more this one's real chocolate real chocolatey like a poppin believe the link for that video down in the description last but certainly not least we got them new time new thing greasy puffs treats [Music] made with real Reese's peanut butter all right so greasy puffs it looks like it's got like peanut butter peanut butter chips in it and then the bottom is I would have some peanut butter coating that's all let's go cincy what you Michalek candy bar that's what it reminds me of Oh what can we call it what that's the candy bars called what you McCloud oh yeah I got em I like what do we call I mean you can remember names no definitely reminds me of you watching me call it candy bar look peanut butter flavor decent decent alright finish all four bars mmm you like them all all of them all of them all of them were decent to me some better than others we're gonna go and put them in order how we rank them so what you starting with what the best one into that first me toast trunk second lucky charm hmm Golden Grahams Golden Grahams hmm then racy very sea pups I mean the I don't want to put one at the bottom I don't feel like putting one at the bottom bite this none of these have anything wrong with them so you like them all if I said we're going to the story you can only get one of these again you're getting cinnamon toast crunch yes fair enough this is Mouse's order not really my order though because I don't they're all good and they both I'm not saying they both tastes the same but they both taste like they're supposed to taste like but I don't want to put this at the bottom so I guess it'll be like it's fair enough none of them are the worst he likes them all he doesn't want to pull one at the bottom he doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings fair enough you can go get any of them if you're a fan of any of these you can go me any other tastes like this okay here's how I'm going we're gonna Ricci puffs was the best one tastes like a whatchamacallit candy bar good peanut butter flavor then we're going with the Lucky Charms tastes like you made rice krispies treats but instead of Rice Krispies you use Lucky Charms I'm digging that then I'm going with the Golden Grahams s'mores joints then I'm going with the cinnamon toast crunch cinnamon toast crunch tastes like cinnamon really didn't taste like cinnamon toast crunch to me percent all made by General Mills General Mills makes all of these cereals ricci puffs cinnamon toast crunch Golden Grahams Lucky Charms so maybe in the future we'll see some post some Kellogg's cereal bars who knows no but as always comment subscribe you better you better have you tried any of the cereal bars what

looking at us like so the last thing I did here was I took this man over to this vsync and I just lightly dampened my hands with water and push down like very firmly to get it seems like a lot more firm just to get it kind of pushed down and there so it'll stay together once it's cooled and cut and every time it would start to stick to my hand I just add a little tiny bit more water and Pat it down until it was all the way compacted so it'll come out perfect I love a situation look at him he's not about repetition they'd be looking at us thinking we had too much look at me I'm in a bad

Jennifer Booker your Georgia grown executive chef and the owner of your resident gourmet today I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter rice krispie squares here are your ingredients unsalted butter peanut butter marshmallows and rice krispies so first things first we want to melt our butter and our peanut butter over medium heat right there directly to your pan and then you'll add your peanut butter as well when you'll make sure that your butter is thoroughly melted and your peanut butter softens as well so we'll give it a stir just to help that process along a little bit all right so we're starting to get a good Milt and then we'll add our marshmallows feel free to use whatever brand of marshmallows that you like I'm going to stir those in the heat from the pan will help melt the marshmallows as well as your heart hot butter and peanut butter mixture we'll give that a a minute or two to melt once your marshmallows have started to soften and you can see that they're starting to melt we'll add our rice crispies add those gradually make sure that they're well coated once your rice crispies are well coated with your marshmallow peanut butter and butter mixture we're simply going to transfer that to a well oiled casserole pan so I'll just scoop that right in our pan and be careful this is very hot all right what's good all right once you get everything in your casserole dish I like to just spread it nice and even get it flat on the top and we'll let it cool for about 15 minutes and once it's cooled you cut it into squares and this is what it should look like these are your peanut butter rice krispie squares and I'm chef Jennifer Booker your resident gourmet", "YHBqzAJeO2s": "hello candy toys here and welcome back to our Channel today we will be making spooky marshmallows cereal treats from General Mills Count Chocula Boo Berry and Franken berry so let's get started the first thing you want to do is to add about a stick of butter into your pan and then you're going to melt this completely as soon as it's done melting then we're going to add our marshmallows [Music] now that it is done melting we're gonna go ahead and add our marshmallows we're gonna add one bag of regular marshmallows not too many marshmallows and not the s'mores marshmallows into our melted butter and then we're going to stir it up until the marshmallows have completely dissolved into the butter so let's go ahead and do this and then we'll show you what to do next [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] once your marshmallows have completely dissolved into your butter you want to begin to add the cereal we're going to add three cups total but we're going to add two cups at a time of each kind of cereal it doesn't matter which order you go in you just want to add the two cups first and then come back and add a cup of each kind of cereal so keep on adding this and then we'll show you what to do next [Music] [Music] [Music] now that all of the cereal has been added we're going to mix this up completely we're going to make sure our heat is turned off and stir this until all of the cereal is completely covered and then once this is done we're going to go ahead and begin to shape it so let's keep on mixing this up and then head on over to show you what to do next so now you want to dump your mix into any kind of buttered dish we are doing Halloween plates where we are separating them into big medium and small little balls so we're going to do a little bit at a time dumping it into the plates that have been buttered you can also dump this onto a cookie sheet that's buttered and then cut it with spooky cookie cutters or anything like that or just shape them in different types of shapes or even make squares like the traditional cereal treats here we're going to be shaping them into balls so let's get started shaping them so if you chose to shape yours into a ball what you want to do is to pick up as much as you want meaning whatever size ball you want to make and you want to just keep rounding it and make sure it's really compacted you have to move very quickly because it dries so fast that it may harden too hard for you to be able to shape it so move quickly when making your treats so let's keep on making different size balls and then we'll be back to show you our finished product [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so here's our finished product up close we made three different sizes these are the larger ones then we have some medium size and some small ones for those who don't want to eat like a big one like this they are very sweet but pretty tasty and as you can see you can see all three of the cereals in each of the balls you see the Count Chocula the blueberry and the Franken berry and you will be able to taste all of those so that will do it for us today please don't forget to comment like and subscribe and if you do try this recipe definitely leaves us a comment below or visit our

is Marion I'm videos about cleaning organizing Jewish lights and cooking so definitely subscribe to my channel if you haven't yet and hit that thumbs up but if you like this so let's get into it first I'm going to show you guys the ingredients that you're going to need it's super simple the main thing is rice krispies treats and marshmallows and then you also need some butter or margarine to mix those together for the rice krispies treats and then we're going to make three different things of pumpkin monsters and a turkey so all fall themed desserts for the turkey you're going to need candy corns little eyes chocolate chips for the pumpkin you're going to need orange food coloring and something for the stem I'm using a Mike and Ike and for the monsters you're going to also need some little eyes and then white chocolate that's it super simple under like button okay so let's get into it so as soon as I'm making three treats today I'm gonna mix up the mixture in a glass bowl and then I'll come back to you guys and show you what to do for each different treat okay so the first thing we're gonna make is mini pumpkins and the way I'm going to do that is I microwaved half package of marshmallows with one and a half tablespoons of butter for 30 seconds and then start it really quickly um you want to try and do this quickly while it's still hot and I have my orange food coloring and I'm just gonna put in about two or three drops to see if I get the color that I want and then I can add more from [Music] okay this is looking really good so I'm gonna add ghee rice krispies Justin okay I'm back there ants krispies are all mixed in and the easiest way to shape them is to actually get your hands a little bit wet with some water this will help them Marcel I'm not stick to your hands so you can form them into pumpkins okay so you're just gonna get in there with your hands grab some warm it into a little ball and then I like my pumpkins to be a little bit princess style so I like flatten them out a little bit and as you keep going it will start sticking up to your hands more so the best thing to do is just rinse under warm water when it rinse them under water again and then start again forming them into balls okay so now that your little pumpkins are shape all you're gonna do is add the stems I'm using Mike and Ikes you can also use like tootsie rolls or anything that's like really in this shape that's either brown green or orange or like do whatever the heck you want but that's just what I'm doing here so all you do is take little Mike and Ike and push it into the pumpkin and I like to hold the pumpkin while I use because it'll kind of like break apart if you don't and that's it and then I squeeze it back into more of the like little princess pumpkin shape that I like and that's your little pumpkin isn't he so cute and the other thing that you can do is I have some white chocolate that I melted my added green food coloring so if you want you can sort of make like little leaves and stems and they'll look like this and yeah so just like some fun decorations you can eyes also use chocolate to make like just Lantern fees or whatever you know just have fun with it so I'm gonna finish these up and then I'll move on to the turkey okay for your level Thanksgiving turkeys what you're going to do is after you've made your rice krispies cheat mix you're going to flatten it out into a baking sheet so that you have a clean surface to work with and then you're just gonna like use a cookie cutter to cut out circle shapes so these are my little circle shapes that I'm going to use to work with then you're going to use candy corn to make the feathers around the turkey and eyes and chocolate chips okay so the first thing I do is I take the candy corn and I put it all around the edge of the circle and I just do one edge um so it's kind of like you know the back who fit their games bars also if your candy corns are not sticking like if you've waited until the rice krispies it's almost like dry you can just use some melted chocolate or a little bit of icing to get them to Center so I'll show you guys how I'm making this fan feather turkey shape I just put the candy corn like that and then to make the nose you're going to take one chocolate chip put them in the center and then for the eyes I'm just gonna go like this [Music] so that's my little turkey guy and now I'm gonna move on to the monster or the last Street I happy today of these are the monsters and this one's my favorite because you can be super creative with it and pretty much to do what you want so what I like to do is use sprinkles to decorate if you have a melted chocolate or icing you can definitely use that too and and then the eyes look so cute on it I always use one eye for a monster that's how you tell if the monster okay so I'm gonna start with the sprinkles okay guys so I'm just gonna finish this up and then I'll show you guys the final finished product so here are the little monsters I used um the white chocolate with green food coloring to do some little mouths and hair for them here are the little pumpkins with the Mike and Ikes stems and also the white chocolate with green food coloring to do little beads and stuff on them the camera would focus and then my favorite level guys but turkeys aren't these so cute I love them yeah those are all three treats ready to go for Halloween Thanksgiving in just the fall so thank you guys so much for watching this video hope you liked it if you did make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel thanks for watching bye [Music]", "ITnCAfTM0yY": "hey i'm going to show you guys how to make a couple of Lucky Charms streets first we'll make some lucky charm squares you will need a large pot an eight-by-eight pan and some cooking spray or butter five cups of Lucky Charms one package or about four cups of mini marshmallows one quarter cup of butter a handful of lucky charms marshmallows and about a half a cup of any kind of chocolate chips first turn on the stove to medium heat and melt your butter and as always don't drop your bowl once the butter has melted add the marshmallows I like to spray my spatula to keep the marshmallows from sticking to it sir until the marshmallows have melted also spray your pan then turn off the heat and mix in the cereal until it's all coated in the marshmallows poured the cereal into the pan and flatten dough now we're going to melt the chocolate I'm using semi-sweet but you can use whatever you have in the house melt it for 30 seconds at a time stirring in between I started with white chocolate chips but they burnt I thought I put it in for 30 seconds but I put it in for three minutes and then walked away it smelled awful in the kitchen for almost a week just keep an eye on what you're doing and you won't have any trouble once it has melted put it into a ziploc bag push the chocolate to one side and twist it and then cut off a corner drizzle it over top of the cereal while the chocolate is still wet sprinkle your ex lucky charms over the top let it cool for 30 minutes to one hour then cut it into squares while you're waiting for the Lucky Charms swears to set up you can make some lucky charm spark you'll just need two and a half cups of chocolate two cups of lucky charms cereal and a cookie sheet first melt the chocolate for 30 seconds at a time stirring in between once it's melted stirring the lucky charms once it has all been coated in chocolate poured onto the cookie sheet and spread it very thin and as evenly as you can if you have some extra cereal or marshmallows you can sprinkle those on top if you like put it in the fridge to set up this won't take long as it's so thin maybe 10 to 15 minutes once it has firmed up break it into pieces and a joy", "sizHDMvv-d4": "everyone welcome back to another episode of the cooking golf and tonight I'm gonna rant a little bit because there's something that I'm really upset about one of my favorite cereals has no at least to me been put out the pasture by the way of them coming up with a new recipe of course a lot of you people probably think that this cereal was gone anyways because of some stupid Facebook posts about 90s foods that are no longer with us I'm talking about rice krispies treats cereal here in West Virginia we've sold it ever since 1993 when everywhere it came out at least I think that's the year I came out I've loved it since I was a little kid and it was my favorite cereal now they got this this thing right here which is it's not there's no one treats like rice krispies treats is supposed to have its individual pieces with little tiny hydrated marshmallows I've tried this cereal before and I'm not gonna lie doesn't taste bad but it is not original it does not compare to the sheer greatness of the original formula there's even a petition online that I found I'll try to find the link again and put the link in the description if they want the original formula to come back don't know I've had this in a Rubbermaid container for about a year and they're kind of they're not really dried out they're still crunchy so crispy yeah this is how they originally looked and I'm still taste one oh hey that might be one of the last times I ever try my favorite cereal from whenever I was a kid so sue me if you guys are complaining about me eating your own circle um but I mean why should you mess with the formula yeah I'm incredibly mad about it I mean really you didn't have to change nothing you guys yeah I mean credibly pissed off about it I'm just gonna say pissed off and that's what I am I never really put that many random videos on my youtube doesn't taste bad but this is not the same I mean honestly I'm not saying that the original a formula is superior because I'm nostalgic for it I'm saying it because it is superior Oh No maybe you didn't test well in a lot of other places but maybe didn't so well in other places that's why you guys don't carry it but I mean we here in West Virginia I love it at least make it for us damn it look at that it's not about crew is this ma'am I'm just I'm depressed so you guys that still ate this girl you guys you guys my cats hitting the tripod for you guys to that are still scream about it flip out about it you heard from what I understand post I'm in the same exact thing with honeycombs these people just gonna keep on doing it I know um rice krispies treats us Kellogg's but I mean we need to show them though they didn't quit they need to quit it now because you're with some great  I need it back in my life I hope I'm not sick for work tomorrow because I ain't that piece of cereal I doubt I will I once watched LA beast eat 30 year old cereals cereals yes like he ate a whole ton of them but not just one not just five like and afterwards he missed probably like maybe ten cereals maybe maybe more afterwards he dried called milk all that milk oh that miss combined in um I mean hehe it was a great video don't know a lot you just check them out la beast but one thing that you can pass one you know checking out is this not bad cereal but we need though formula to come back I'm the cooking goth and get night everyone yeah halfway I'll give you a full one", "iSKFi22vp_o": "[music playing]", "rP8rQMeS5LE": "wait you're poisonous yeah hey guys so today I'm making rice krispie treats but I do not have rice krispies treats so I'm using Lucky Charms so actually this will be called lucky crispy treats so this box of Lucky Charms has no marshmallows in it because my little siblings took out all the marshmallows in the left of the box open now the cereal is stale and it tastes very nasty so we're going to fix that so first we're going to be getting a pin oh look at my nails anyways you want to turn on your stove to medium heat and then you wait for the pan to get warm enough so we can pour in our nasty stale cereal once it's all poured in I let it just sit there maybe I stirred it up a little bit but I wanted to leave it alone so it can get nice and toasty I didn't really time this I just kept an eye on the cereal until it got this light golden color that you find on a perfect marshmallow but you should also try it to see if it has that nice crispy texture oh did you hear that crunch that means it's good to go so we'll let that rest while we get a bowl to make our glue you'll need marshmallows and butter put the butter in your bowl and we're going to heat that up in the microwave for one minute hold on this is too much butter we need to cut that fat because we are on a diet okay now back to the microwave to heat that up for one minute while the butter was melting I came across a nasty surprise apparently the pan is still hot even after you take it off the heat so I actually burnt my cereal but there's no time to worry about that because my butter is done I actually stopped at 30 seconds because it was all melted by then now we're gonna put in our marshmallows I basically used the rest of the marshmallows we had and I just popped them all in there not a good idea because the hot butter spilled back at me and hurt my leg so I put nine marshmallows in here altogether not counting the one that I just dropped on the ground but that's okay we can fix that okay now there's ten marshmallows in here we're gonna heat this up in the microwave for one minute while that was heating up I got to pick out the burnt cereal from my pen oh yeah I forgot to mention we're supposed to watch the marshmallows heat up and stop it every 15 seconds to stir and make sure it doesn't overflow like you can see here I did not do that I just let it heat up for one minute so here's just me cleaning up my microwave and trying to put off mush balls back in the bowl side note it's a bit unsanitary to eat the marshmallows that had fallen onto your microwave platform but our microwave platform looks pretty clean to me so I just I ate it and it was good now that we're back on track we can mix all our ingredients together just pour it in nice and slowly and make sure not to spill any cereal on your counter but if you do everyone makes mistakes and you can just put that back in your bowl I'm going to give this a nice healthy mix till all the cereal is covered in this beautiful stretchy marshmallow look at that it should look like mozzarella cheese so this is good but it's not extremely good but it's not bad it's okay eating it like spaghetti I can't say the more I eat it the more addicted I got and I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing [Music] Monica really likes you which is good toasty crunchy is it good then what do you say you say please please delicious mmm thank you for watching Madison's cooking show wait", "3OUDhl7WXoA": "hey guys welcome back to another video on stila stuff and things today we are gonna make our first easter treat of

krispie treat peeps easter something i don't even know what to call it but super simple i actually saw it on a facebook video no one was mentioned so i don't know where it came from but it's all over the place so i'm sorry i can't tell you who the originator is but just enjoy while we get these ready in our pan we're going to go ahead and preheat our oven 350 degrees and that's that simple so you're going to get a baking dish of your choice you could also get a throwaway dish maybe you're going to an easter event but we're just going to take our peeps line them up and you have to have a mixture of colors for the peeps and we're just going to do multi-color you know there's really no rules it's kind of how you want to do it peeps are probably the most controversial candy of all time like any holiday like anything peeps is controversial so let me know are you a fan or not because i don't feel like there's any in between it's like you either love them or hate them we are personally not a peeps fan but for right now this is a marshmallow so we're just thinking of it as a marshmallow dish with the rice krispies so it works out fine this will be great to take to your family parties for easter have for the kids maybe a school party anything like that you could be the rice krispie treat mom for that day they will love you for it i promise okay once you have all your peeps in the bottom of your pan next up we have our rice krispie treats i'm not measuring it out i'm just going to pour it over the marshmallows the peeps until we kind of till they're just like peeping out the top you know because you're going to do a second layer of this can you believe that i don't know who's gonna eat this i don't know if we'll even eat it we'll have to give it to a neighbor okay so we've got our layer of rice krispies now we're gonna go back in do some more peeps got your peeps layer with your rice krispies okay are you guys freaking out so fun fact i don't like sticky and peeps are sticky when you pull them apart it's stressing me out a little bit can you relate then we're gonna take our butter we're just gonna put like eight tablespoons on top of our mixture here you know this is going to be fun asa stressing i can tell you're just going to put it right on top it's not going to be like normal rice krispie treats guys it's a little bit different okay i feel like it's going to be way sweeter i don't know this might be a fail we'll see i don't know that we've ever had a fail on our channel i feel like this could end up like that outfit that you see on a mannequin and you're like that is so cute and then you go try it on you're like oh my gosh that's not cute at all you know what i'm talking about this could end up like that it looked so easy and so cute when i saw it on facebook i don't know you have to hang around we're gonna throw this in our oven for eight minutes that's it just eight minutes on 350 degrees fingers crossed that it works oh my goodness so it's out from what i saw in the video you just kind of mix it up i i don't know i don't know that i did enough butter let's see it's gonna be a pill i'm like i told ace i'm stirring this little peep eyeballs are staring at me like don't don't stir me away okay it's working it's working really well i'm super impressed you could make it the night before easter and leave it out for the easter bunny do you guys leave things out for the easter bunny like santa we're gonna add sprinkles because why not oh my gosh so cute you could get little easter bunny sprinkles or something like that if you wanted to add it to it we did it i think it turned out super cute if you had more peeps you could like put them all over but i don't think you need any more than that the question is does it taste good for us non-peep eaters so we're gonna let it cool we'll come back later when abby gets home and try it out for you do you like peeps i don't like peach i don't either me either abby do you like peeps i don't think she does i think she spit them out it's probably a texture thing yeah do you think i mean or first thing who doesn't like peeps like i don't i've never met anyone that actually

"[Music] so here is a super easy and fun recipe just in time for christmas i picked up my ingredients from a grocery store called aldi sometimes they carry these little white baking morsels which you can use i am going to use their white chocolate bar which is really creamy and delicious i think and so we'll start by breaking up the chocolate and i want to just rough chop this into some small pieces and then we will also crush the peppermint candies i will leave the measurements and all the ingredients below the video and then spray your dish with some nonstick cooking spray and then in a non-stick skillet melt your butter on low to medium low heat and then add your salt and now we can add the marshmallows we're going to melt these marshmallows until they're nice and creamy and then you can begin to add your rice krispies and then a little bit of the candies i just kind of add these two slowly alternating so they don't all clump up in one area and after all that has been combined real well you can transfer it to your dish where we will press it down after they have cooled about 15 to 20 minutes or longer you can put it on some wax paper and cut them into the size rice krispie treats you like i like to layer them on wax paper so that they don't stick so there you go i hope you can make these they are so delicious and also if you haven't subscribed already please hit that

girl Dominica back with another video you can find me on Facebook and Instagram at Dominica Jade [Music] this is a quick video on these dip rice krispies treats so let's get right to it I wanted to try out these larger rice krispies treats these are the 1.3 ounce bars after trying them I will be sticking with the smaller ones I'll link in the description box the rice krispies treats that I normally use you want to let the chocolate harden around the stick after that they'll be ready to dip [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] while the drizzle is wet go ahead and add your sprinkles I didn't care for the 1.3 ounce bars because I just think they're too big and flimsy for the treat stick and that is it for today thank you for watching don't forget to Like and subscribe", "Q6IaOAkASl8": "for today's challenge I'm gonna make the best rice krispies now if you're like me you learn how to make rice krispies from your mom and you assume that that's the only way to make them but I just watched this video by Alton Brown and he does every step differently so we're gonna do both ways find out which one is the best and start making it that way from then on so let's start with his he starts with a wok I do not have a wok but I have this giant pan and that's good enough we're gonna go with a large box of rice krispies and you toasts the entire box [Music] so that is actually not a big enough fan ideally I'd have more room in there but we're just gonna we're gonna make it work can we make it work things are not going according to plan [Music] we're gonna have to make it work so I have this on the low heat and keep stirring it till smell toasted [Music] [Music] so toasting is a key difference that's not involved in my recipe so I want to make sure I give it a good toast I don't under toast it because we are testing the difference in the recipes here but I I think it's just about toasted it feels pretty hot I'm hearing the occasional snap and crackle there's a little bit of a smell of burnt rice krispies so I think we're good [Music] these are things hosted so now we are going to dump the rice krispies [Music] apparently wasn't storing that area very well so we're going to try to have it [Music] where's Krispies we're saving for later now I am going to similar toasting the rice krispies we're going to brown the butter carry gold high quality premium butter stick of this is going in and I'm going to brown it hopefully not burn it because it would be harder to separate the burn from the not burn as it has to do for the rice krispies [Music] against the wall feet and we'll keep it moving around in there it's very yellow I guess that's a quality of this high quality high premium I don't know what's special about it but those yellow celebration because it's pronounced that on elemental grass welcome if I tell anybody brazen grass over grandpa I think we're almost there all right yeah so now we are going to add the marshmallows two bags of ten ounce mini marshmallows [Music] [Music] [Music] we're gonna cover this in butter and just stir it until the marshmallow is completely dissolved again on the low flame a little bit higher than that [Music] super gloopy I'm seeing specks of black in here hopefully that isn't burned rice crispies that we're in because I'm sure that taste will come through hopefully it's just those common black spots that are in marshmallow right [Music] it's looking a little bit like cookies and cream ice cream all right I think this is pretty well mixed definitely liquefied so what we're going to do now is add in all of the rice krispies which is going to be difficult because if you remember they didn't even fit by themselves but luckily I purchased some some of it were burned and some fell out while I was pouring so maybe it'll fit better now let's go stir these up slowly this is looking pretty well combined right now I just see like some rice krispies I'm not seeing any blobs of marshmallow or packets of dry cereal see it all combined so now for the difficult part because everything in his recipe was difficult for some reason you'll see when once we get to mine I'm going to quickly now take the rice krispies oh no where is the bag so this should have stayed inside there and it shouldn't have this long rip down the side of it so let me turn the heat on for a second I don't want this to solidify while I'm quickly thinking of a plan B I think I'm going to just put it in there anyway all right a little bit of cooking spray in the bag the bag in the box [Music] and now he fills the bag back up with rice krispies [Music] so let's see if this works this is not gonna work [Music] he used his hands I'm not gonna do that once I have to this is not work maybe it's working all right we're taking this out of the box and put it back in the box later luckily now I have this slit down the sides your give me easy access it should be able to come up easier assuming that this smacking Hannity testicle needly living room that shot back box [Music] there's plenty of room in here I think we can fit the rest the rest of the treats if they have been solidified on me are gonna make their way in the box and there we are all of our ice krispies are back in the box which definitely feel warm on me up on the outside I can feel the heat in the cardboard I'm going to condense it a little bit because I like a really tightly packed for its crispy treat and condensing when it's still warm is how you get it to stay tight once it's room temperature there we go that's method one of rice krispie treats so after filming I realized that my camera actually cut out mid recording I don't know at what point I don't know how much it captured I guess you know because you just saw how I had to edit the prior section but I'm currently going to leave this mess and head over to my parents house because they have a microwave and I do not and we're gonna need one for my technique my method of rice krispies and now for the way that I make rice krispies I start by using the size amounts that are written on the box that means we're going to need three tablespoons of butter which has already started to melt due to it being summer but we're going to let that continue melting by putting it in the microwave well that is melting we're going to measure out 6 cups of rice crispies plates I'm going to take care not to destroy the bag not because I need to use it later but just because we're gonna have leftover cereal that's almost done now your butter is melted and I'm going to dump the whole bag of marshmallows in there and again microwave until melted don't worry about timers and give it a stir every now and then to coat it in butter now we're going to ready our pan sounds not done miss that as well as a piece of parchment paper marshmallows are almost done see they're losing each individual marshmallow and becoming more of like a fluff consistency so we're almost ready here alright that's looking good now we mix them together one of the few times when the recipes are similar because just straightforward stuff of mix and again I'm using a bowl that is just barely big enough which is actually not really big enough but I'm gonna make it work I don't have the heat on when I'm mixing mine so you do have to be quick because it's constantly cooling down and I can't microwave it to heat it back up once it's cool so it's looking pretty combined at the moment I don't see ya looking good so now I'm going to use a pan to form it which is I know a crazy idea it's a little bit messy but it works this and I sprayed so it doesn't stick I won't get my hands sticky to form it out into a rectangle and to compress the crap out of it because I like the very firm and this is how you got a really hard rice krispies treat and we let that cool I let them harden up a bit and now it's time to inspect the finished products let me take this out of the box here this is the heavy mass rice cream cheese I kind of like this presentation to be honest it's visibly darker due to the toasting you can definitely tell it's darker it does have little flecks of black which I suspect or burned something we'll see if that paste is rock solid all right that one tastes like a rice krispies treat [Music] this will also taste like a rice krispy treat the ratio of the ingredients is different between them we just had one bag of marshmallows and six cups of rice krispies this has two bags but significantly more than twelve cups I didn't give that 18 cups so this one's got a lot more marshmallows and you can definitely tell that when you vanish when you look at it it looks like cereal whereas this one looks you can see a lot more marshmallow in it and try to break off another piece here which this one it's like it cracks and crumbles it's very dry but this has more of a sticky it has a lot of give to it tastes like a stretchy where's that ones are cracky perhaps when you bite into it - I think this one's probably better like that fancy baking if you wanted to carve out of it so it'll hold its shape better cuz it's a solid block I think taste wise more marshmallows than this is much better I do not taste the difference in butter or toasting so for me no taste difference but this has butter consistency I will ask some other people get their opinion but as far as I'm concerned I've known how to make the best rice krispies for a while now because it's this one and often you had some fancy ideas for being a little kid but try with the microwave next time [Music]", "CU57bQVDXqU": "[Music] hello everyone this rainbow rice krispy recipe was inspired by an idea found on Pinterest there'll be a link in the description box to the original idea however what I've done is added a little bit of a fruity twist to these so starting off with a medium-sized saucepan on low heat place one tablespoon of butter I use salted butter you can use unsalted butter or margarine if you prefer now you need to add one cup of marshmallows I added large marshmallows and one cup of large marshmallows is approximately nine marshmallows you can also use the miniature kind of course just I'll stir those over low heat and make sure it is low heat because these things will burn quite quickly if it's any higher than that once they'll start to melt you can add some food color to give it the nice rainbow color now I decided to try something a bit different I added one tablespoon of jelly powder or jello powder this is strawberry jell-o powder and I just stirred it in and wanted to see what kind of color to get with it and it did make a very nice pink color but I wanted to intensify that a little bit so I had it just a couple of drops of red food color to that just to make the color a little bit brighter I stirred that around and then added one cup of rice krispies cereal once the marshmallow was completely melted stir it around until the cereal is completely coated with the marshmallow mixture then you're going to line an 8x8 inch baking dish with tinfoil grease the foil with some margarine or butter or some cooking spray then dump in the rice krispies marshmallow mixture and spread it out evenly in the bottom of the pan using a buttered spatula or a buttered spoon or even just your fingers that have been coated with butter spread it out as evenly as you can and work quickly because the rice krispies and the marshmallow sets up pretty fast just try to get it as even a layer as you can in the pan now basically all you're gonna do from here on is just repeat this five more times with all the other different colors so that's one tablespoon of butter 1 cup of Marsh which turns out to be about nine large ones a tablespoon of the jello powder if you want to use that and a little bit of food coloring and then the rice krispies once everything is melted now in order to make this go a little bit quicker what I suggest you do is use two medium sized sauce pans once you're done with one saucepan and you've used it and there's marshmallow stuck to the bottom of it put it in the sink with some hot water in it and then make your take a clean pan and make your next layer by the time that layer is finished the pot that's sitting in the sink will be very easily cleaned you'll probably just have to dump the water out and just wipe it dry it'll be ready to reuse again and you can just alternate back and forth between sauce pans that way and it might go a little bit faster so you can see I have it a little bit of paste food color and in this case I use just a tiny little bit just to intensify the color after I made these I probably realized that I probably didn't need to add the extra color I would have made just more of a pastel colored rainbow which would have been fine on its own so once your second layer is done spread it over top of the first one the same way you did the first one by spreading it out using a buttered spatula and then once all your layers are on let it set pull it out of the pan using the tin foil and then cut it into squares and it's ready to serve and here are the completed squares these tastes a little bit different than your regular rice krispie squares because of the added jello and I have a little bit more sweetness and of course it adds the fruit flavor all of the different flavors of jello work will very well together taste a little bit like fruit punch when they're all mixed up they look great and just like any rice krispies treat they're always better on the first day as they tend to harden up a little bit on the second and subsequent days and you just have to store them in an airtight container and that's it so why don't you give them a try", "78IOp6iyvac": "okay baby done make we're gonna be making a some strawberry carrots puppy chow and some rice krispies so we're gonna start off with chocolate dipped strawberries and the chocolate that we're going to be using today is the Wilton brand the candy melts they are orange because we're wanting them to look like carrots we have some toothpicks and then we just have a little baggie that we're going to be squeezing the strawberries with and then we have our Melcher so I'm gonna start off with the strawberries and all you want to do is hook this what they called toothpick in the strawberry put all a little Leafs down so you can have it like that and then push this back and then once we're in there we're just gonna swirl it all the way around straight it can go everywhere this swirl it around so I can't go everywhere and just move it around too like it's not that thick and some other truck that comes off just like that and then we have a little plate with a little bit of parchment paper on there but you just want to keep doing that all over again and then we have a little bag inside a little bag you're just gonna want to add a little bit of some of the chocolate in there just a little tad what depends on me and then you know when I'm make a little tiny hole in the bottom of the baggie okay that's too small okay so we're just gonna try to keep cutting it and just be careful with the back because it's gonna be hot but you want it to be hot just because if it's too cold it's not going to come out so you know you don't want to do is do this and then Eunice was only on top so they can look like little care but that's just the strawberries and then right now we're gonna be showing you some of the other recipes okay so this is gonna be our second one and it's gonna be the Rice Krispies for those strawberries you just want to put them in the fridge for about 10 minutes until they cool down and you guys can be able to eat them so for the rice krispies we're gonna need a box of any Rice Krispies that you want we're using this brand and then for the marshmallows we have the Walmart bread and we're getting the minis and then we're using this ramp for butter and it's only three ingredients that's all we're gonna be using today and then it's a full bag of the you know I dumped all the marshmallows on this bowl and then this butter we buy em on sticks and has the measurements on top like 20 points and stuff and then you want to microwave this every like 15 seconds stir it up until it's all the way melted and then from there we add it to the rice krispies and for the rice krispies it's gonna be 6 cups of rice krispies so we're not do the microwave thing real quick and like that guys can see the melting process okay okay see that you guys want your marshmallow to be like running in good to go and then we're just gonna be dumping it in our rice krispies I don't remember if I told you guys how much butter but it is 1/4 of a cup of butter and then we're just gonna stir it up let me see if I can do this they're just covering just spacing and you can also add some food coloring just if you want to change the egg color we want to keep it white like just a regular because we are gonna add some candies to make it Easter themed so oh yeah [Music] we're gonna make these into the shape of like um some Easter so that would be fun okay guys so we're just gonna keep stirring it and then once it's all like sticky and good to go we're gonna put in the fridge prop up twenty minutes oh I can cool down and we can actually shape it up and do it the way we want to do it so we're gonna do that real quick put it in the fridge so it can be done and then I'll show you guys right now what we're trying to do with the Easter eggs okay so we just took them out of the fridge and they're not as sticky as before how they were when we were mixing it and we're gonna be using this cooking spray some egg shows and the egg shells are we wash them or just a little bit of warm water and some dish soap and then for this little rice krispies Egg Easter thing well I don't know what to say okay after this one we're just gonna want to add a little cooking spray on the egg shells so like that it's easier to take them out and then we're also going to be putting a little spray on our hands and just mixing our hands together and then and then you guys can start doing that suit Lizzy we're gonna try to put and um some rice krispies in here and arena just show her like our thumb in there so I can like make a hole where Jill trying to make the Easter look whiskas be look like an Easter Egg basically so let's hope this works I know so we're just going to make the hole in there just like that so I'm both of them all of you can see so a hole like so we can um what's it called put some stuff in there so this is the bottom piece and then we have our little mix right here of our candies and sprinkles that's all I'm gonna be doing is adding a couple oh shoot a couple in there putting the nest in there and you can close this up and then it turns on into Easter Egg and then you can always add a little bit of sprinkles just because it is still a little bit sticky but yeah so they're doing that one too yeah yeah our third treat and this one's gonna be puppy chow people usually call it as well muddy buddies there's like a whole bunch of different answer but we call that puppy chow and it is super easy and we're gonna be using this kind of cereal it's the Walmart brand and we're gonna be using the whole bag so she's gonna be doing the dump in on this container and then [Music] [Music] about six teaspoons of butter and then we're gonna put this in the microwave for about again 15 minutes stir it up until it's all the way like liquefied and then we're gonna dump it in the right now so we're gonna start the melting process right about now we want our chocolate and peanut butter I'm better to be cool and then you can also add a some vanilla extract at this one at the Dollar Tree because I didn't have time to go to Walmart and then have you this is totally optional you don't have to put it on but this just to add extra flavor and if you do end up using I don't want to use half a teaspoon in there so I'm gonna add it on there just one teaspoon and then we're gonna mix it together okay so we're just gonna mix that around so the vanilla Eckles everywhere and then we know we're gonna be dumping it on here okay so one is gonna put me cold back just cuz the glass bowl is pretty heavy so good so we're just gonna want to mix it all together in there move fast but not too fast do not turn up we'll keep mixing okay so this is how much you want it to look like see try to get as much chocolate to every little cereal and before it gets dry we put on each powder sugar so this is the powder sugar that we'll be using its one more round as well I put one cup to each bag change the bag and then two cups of this cereal and there are just going to be shaking them up and every axis anyway it's gonna end up already a really good consistency of shaking yeah and the chunky ones are really good because it's full of more chocolate and stuff so let me show you off really quick look close and then we did a little mixture of some Easter candies and then the Easter candies that we're gonna be using today are this one doesn't so oldest and snack is sprinkles I don't know if you guys can see so this Easter sprinkles we have these chocolate M&Ms and then yeah I don't know they had peanuts throw these little mixtures and I mixed them all together we're just gonna be dumping them on top but that's our puppy chow one so this is how our yes strawberry carrots look like let me see bacon in the bottom it is crushed Oreos so we just crush them up so I could look like the dirt this ones are a puppy chow let me see if I can get it closer to you guys so tell our puppy child came out to look and I just have something under section you can see it and this is our Rice Krispies eggs they're a little good but they came out so we're gonna be doing a taste test taste test of the puppy chow have a little bunch ready one

Rice Krispies no there on the bench pretty one two three go okay thumbs up alright guys so this is gonna be the end of the video we hope you and head to Belle alright guys peace out", "PBCmLi0kJ34": "are you looking for a super super easy treat for yourself and your kids this week I have one for you I mean even if you don't have kids I think you're gonna like this one it's based on an all-time favorite cereal honey nut cheerios it's a honey nut cheerios bar super easy fast and delicious I have three cups of Oto's in this bowl any ohto will do Cheerios included then I'm chopping up three-quarters of a cup of toasted salted almonds put them in the bowl with your three cups of oat goes and then you can get your sauce you need to melt four tablespoons of unsalted butter quarter cup of packed light brown sugar that sounded like a hockey puck going in there didn't it it's not as hard as it sounds a quarter cup of honey hence the honey net Oh Bar named Cheerios not really in the name 1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt and a pinch of cinnamon what you need to do is combine all these ingredients you can cut the butter into pieces if you want so it'll melt more quickly and then boil it for one minute if you boil it too long the mixture gets too hard to pour it into your cereal mixture so one to two minutes no more it's been a minute now you want to combine your sauce with your cereal mixture pour it evenly over and then just stir it to combine and you're done with all your work see this is the part that would be hard to do if you had overcooked it if it gets too hard it won't distribute throughout your cereal mixture and then the stuff won't get coated I made it so hard this is an 8x8 baking dish I've lined it with parchment leaving an overhang on all sides it'll help you lift your cereal bars out when it's cold just transfer it to the dish plan a dish it's a cake pan it's an 8 by 8 by 2 cake pan that's what it is I mean it doesn't have to be a cake pan it could be a it could be a baking dish like a casserole press it in some firm nice and even and then it just needs to cool for about 30 minutes not even that long it cools pretty quickly when your cereal bars have had time to cool you can unwrap them see how easily they lift it out because of the parchment paper it's really great just fold it back and then cut it into squares whatever size you want I like the serrated knife for this just like I like it for cutting not see these serrated edges they just go straight through and the offset handle keeps your knuckles away from the board it's kind of ridiculous how easy these are to make and how delicious they are you're just gonna be so popular if you make bring them to an office party people look at them will be like what and then they'll eat them and they'll be like oh I love you honey nut Oh bars it's like breakfast it's so much sweeter hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and

want to see that something great is better but you know it's um some nice butter so right now you're just gonna want to mix it all in wait for your marshmallows to melt yeah how rum medium I turn it

and put your ceiling tell us about no marshmallows left I end dump in your cereal like I said before it's three tablespoons of cannabutter to five cups or six cups of cereal you pop putting some more if you want you're gonna want to spray cooking oil on your pan to a rice krispie treats honk instead so your rice crispy fries down sticks and dump it on there so yeah once you get it all out of the pot and there you go you have your finished product I messed up before do not prove in the fridge just let them sit out very cool and that's it thank you", "M98EasrzCBE": "hey guys it's tiffany today we're making oreo rice krispie treats so first thing obviously put up her hair i'm going to go wash my hands and back so you need for these is of course rice crispy cereal again doesn't matter six cups six cups didn't work this time i don't know why obviously you need your marshmallows you need your oreos crushed oh there they are delete i guess you need butter i'm doing a whole stick of butter this time because i just wanted it to be a little more buttery if you don't then just stick to the six tablespoons and vanilla let's get started so we start off by putting our butter over medium heat so we let that melt and once it's melted we'll put in the marshmallows now the butter is melted we put in the marshmallows we stir these until they're melted once they're melted we put in a teaspoon of vanilla once that is all mixed together we turn off the heat and we add in our rice krispies and oreos [Music] oh and for this i used 16 oreos and crushed them up now you mix now that it's all mixed together we put it in our prepared baking dish now that's in there just move it around fill the pan once it's moved around where you want just take a little piece of parchment paper and press it down don't press too hard because you don't want it to be like a rock when you are eating it but i found that using a piece of parchment paper to press it down is honestly the easiest way or to [Music] get yourself into a bit of a sticky situation [Music] so this is what it should look like when it's done and you will put this aside for about an hour to set and then you can eat", "TiZdCV-UiUQ": "hey guys it's Rachel and today we are making these adorable watermelon rice krispies treat pops these are perfect for a summer pool party because you can just kind of grab them and go and they're also perfect if you have younger cousins or younger relatives I personally have some younger nephews that I'm definitely going to be bringing these to and I hope they're gonna like them because I don't know rice krispies treats are very nostalgic I think and I have to admit that I personally love rice krispies treats I know it's only basically like butter marshmallows and rice krispies but still I think that they are so good and this recipe is even cuter because they're shaped like little watermelons too so let's get started first off in a large bowl you'll need 4 cups of mini marshmallows I like to use the minis because they melt a lot faster than the large ones but use whatever you have on hand then add in 3 tablespoons of butter and pop that off into the microwave at 20 second intervals until it gets all nice and melted if you've made rice krispies treats before you know that this is some seriously sticky stuff I mean it is melted marshmallow afterall so just don't get it in your hair or anything next step add in some green gel food coloring this is for the outer rind of our watermelon and just mix that through working quickly add in 4 cups of rice krispies this mixture isn't going to set immediately but you do want to give yourself enough time to get this into the pan so just fold that all the way through it's going to take some muscle here but you're just going to have to have some persistence for your rice krispies treats after you've had a good workout at that you're going to pop this into an 8-inch pan that's been greased with cooking spray this recipe makes enough for 2 8 inch pans so only add in about half of your rice krispies treats here then grease your hands up very well cooking spray and by very well I mean like spray them down for at least a good 5 seconds each and then mold this to the side of your pan give it a good firm press making sure that it's held together really well and then set that aside now just repeat for your other 8-inch pan this is a great time to get your younger siblings involved because I'm sure they would love to get their hands messy now for the red part of our watermelon you're going to need five cups of mini marshmallows pop in three tablespoons of butter and again microwave that off then you know the drill just mix it through until it's all smooth now we're going to add in our red gel food coloring and then grab your spatula and mix that through to get a really nice red color you're probably going to have to add in quite a bit of red gel food coloring but just be patient once you're happy with the color you're going to add in five cups of rice krispies and you can see I like to add in the rice krispies about half at a time this way is a little bit easier on your arms to mix through then I finish it off with the remaining two cups and went in for the final mix once all your rice krispies are coated you're just going to pop half of this into one of your pans and again using some very well greased up hands you're going to press this into your pants press that in really well especially at the seam to make sure that it sticks together and if it helps you can use some wax paper to get it really nice and smooth lay your rice krispies set for about 15 minutes or so then run a knife around the edge of the pan then you're just going to flip this over give it a couple hard taps in the back and voila you have your watermelon slice now I'm just going to take a knife that's been greased very very well and I'm going to cut this into 8 equal pieces to add any popsicle sticks I found out that the best method was to put in the stick part way and then stand the watermelon pop up on its end and push down from there this seems to do the least amount of like squishing damage to the rice krispies trees then for the watermelon seeds I'm going to use some mini chocolate chips and then I'm just going to push these into our rice krispies treats and that's it alright guys our watermelon rice krispies treats are finished now and these looks super cute oh my gosh this is like a throwback to those watermelon cookies I made forever ago which you guys shouldn't watch that video but now that I mentioned it of course you're going to go back and watch it but it's kind of a throwback to that and that's somewhere dessert that I made forever ago anyway so I hope you

time of the year if i'm honest so today i'm going to be making lucky charms treats that are a lot like rice krispies streets except you're using lucky charm cereal you can do this on the stove or in the microwave i'm going to use the microwave so you're gonna start off with three tablespoons of butter i'm gonna pop this in the microwave for about 15-20 seconds just to get it softened a little bit and then i'll be right back now i'm going to add in a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows now i'm gonna put this back in the microwave for a minute stir it up and check it and when it's all melted i'll be back to show you what the next step is i'm going to go ahead and add in a couple of drops of green food coloring this is totally optional of course and now i'm going to add in six cups of lucky charm cereal and fold it in until it's all combined i'm trying not to break up the cereal too much once you have it all combined you're going to pour it into a 13 by 9 inch pan this one has been sprayed with pam you can butter the dish or you can just use parchment paper now you want to flatten it out i sprayed my hand with a little bit of pam cooking spray and i'm going to flatten this out if you want these to be super thick you can use an 8 by 8 or 9 by 9 inch pan all right so now i have some marshmallows this is optional i just took them out of the cereal the leftover cereal i'm going to put them on top spread them around a little and push them into the rice krispies treats be careful or you'll crush them like i just did and these are not rice krispie treats anyway you need to let these sit until they are completely cooled and i'll be back at that stage and we'll cut them okay so they're all set up i'm gonna take the butter knife run it around the edges and that just helps you get them out of the pan a little easier and now i'm just going to cut them into squares and this is what they look like when they're done they're so pretty and they taste so good and best of all they're super easy to make i think maybe the next time i'd put a little more green food coloring in because they don't look that green but maybe it's because they're sitting on a green plate i don't know so

TAKES DEDICATION TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL THE SCENE AS A LAW", "vaJcUFzhFIs": "rice krispies treat Christmas ornaments hello everyone this starts off with a regular Rice Krispies recipe except I divided it into two bowls each Bowl contains 20 marshmallows and 2 tablespoons of butter then I put each bowl in the microwave for about a minute two minutes in 30 seconds or so until the marshmallows are all puffed up and the butter is melted and then just stir it all together until it's nice and smooth if you find the marshmallows aren't melted enough just put it back in the microwave for another 5 seconds or so and then stir again then I added some paste food color to this stirred it around until I got a color that I liked and of course I used green and red here but you can use whatever color that you want then I added in 3 cups of rice crispy cereal also called rice bubbles in Australia and I stirred it around until the rice krispies cereal was completely coated with the marshmallow mixture and then I did the same thing with the other Bowl except I tinted it red then once it's cool enough you can form it into little ball shapes and the best way to do this is to wet your hands just a little bit and that way that rice krispies mixture won't stick to your hands for years I was greasing my hands with butter until I found this method with the water and it works so much better so once you've made them into little ball shapes you will end up with about a dozen depending on how big you make them and you need to put little ornament tops on them I use these Rolo candies but you could also use miniature Reese's peanut butter cups I covered them with this little piece of gold foil which I found at Michael's craft store wrap them up so that they look like metal tops of an ornament then I poked a couple of holes using a metal skewer but you could also use a toothpick and then I inserted a small piece of a licorice now the this is red licorice and it comes in a pull and peel package where you have to peel off individual sections and it's the perfect size for this and that is the completed ornament top now you're ready to attach them to your ornaments I used a little bit of candy melt that matched the color of the ornament that I was making so I had red and green but too just use a regular chocolate if you'd like and I attach the ornament top and let it harden and that's it's super simple but so cute and if you want to give them to somebody you can put them in a fancy little Christmas tin and you have a cute little gift now to serve these you get actually put them on a serving tray and add some greenery around them to make them look like they're hanging on a tree that's an actual real branch from a tree but you could use fake Garland as well here are more little edible ornaments that I've made in the past this is another video where I use edible chocolate chip cookie dough as the center and you decorate them with a bunch of sprinkles and these are delicious and they look great and I use a miniature Reese's Peanut Butter Cup to make these ones now I think it would be fun if you made both at the same time it would make a great little gift or a fantastic dessert for Christmastime if you want to see this video go ahead and click right on your screen or see the link in the description box below bye bye", "MsJiWdONTlI": "beautiful I want to say

Facebook user Jennifer Sampson and she has asked me to make some Oreo rice krispies treats let's go Wednesday [Music] so for our Oreo rice krispies treats what we gonna do first just into a bowl I've got some Oreos now what I've done here is I've just crushed them up I've got some smaller pieces I've got some chunky bits I've got some fine bits that's what we want okay we don't want at all the uniform all one way we want different sizes next into the bowl I'm gonna be popping in some rice bubbles as we call them here in Australia or rice krispies it wherever you are basically they're just puffed rice it's a breakfast cereal and I'm just going to add that in as well now I just want to give this a mix around get everything combined so now just put this to one side and we're gonna get started on our marshmallow mixture so just into a saucepan over medium heat I'm going to be adding in some butter and to the butter I'm gonna be adding in some Marsh mellows you can use the mini ones like I am you can use the big ones completely up to you just gonna add them straight in so now what we're gonna do just stir it and keep mixing it don't stop we want to melt that butter down we want to melt those marshmallows down so this is what we're after this silky gooey mixture where everything's just melted down so I'm going to turn the heat off so back over to our puffed rice and the Oreo mixture I'm gonna add in the marshmallow now this next part can get really sticky especially if you've got a spatula and you're moving it around and it can really stick in clumps so what I do just a little trick get some cooking oil spray and just Brahe the spatula and it won't stick so we're just gonna give this a mix around get it all combined so just into a pyrex dish again I've sprayed it with some of that cooking oil I'm gonna be placing in some of our mixture and then just press it into all the corners or the sides so now I'm gonna pop this into the fridge to set and cool and it's only going to take about an hour hour and a half in the fridge that's all so we've just pulled out our Oreo rice krispies square and before we cut it up I'm gonna finish it off with one thing and I think it just goes so well with the Oreos and the rice bubbles or rice krispies I've got some melted white chocolate oh man this is food porn all right and all I want you to do is just drizzle that over the top all right our rice krispies Oreo treats just look at that love it here we go so good I'm only gonna have a little bit mmm that white chocolate for me brings us all together it's a little different I mean I've made rice krispie treats before you know we've made them with M&Ms I think before but the Oreo is really given that nice sort of creamy texture on it almost because of that filling inside the Oreos the crunch of the rice bubbles or rice krispies and like I said that white chocolate is just so so cool this is fantastic for a kids party or any event really it's easy to do takes no time you can portion it out big or small it's up to you but in any case give these bad boys a try because you know what they're just that damn good [Music] [Music]", "vxVOD16mHiA": "[Music] hey guys I hope you enjoyed this video let's just jump right in so to make rice krispie treats you're going to need some parchment paper or some wax paper here like I do if you need your pan you need some butter spray some butter marshmallows vanilla extract and some mini chocolate chips if you want to have that inside of it so first you're going to take your pan and your butter and what I like to do is spray the pan first because that helps the parchment paper stick to it you just says this is something you don't have to do it's just what I like to do so it's up to you guys but make sure that you leave a pretty good amount hanging over because that is what you're going to grab to lift it out of the pan and then I just like to spray right over it again [Music] I don't really do measurements with this but yeah take your butter I would say that it's about three tablespoons and put it in there and let it melt [Music] once it's melted then you're gonna go ahead and add your marshmallows again like I said I did not measure I just put as many as I wanted I am obsessed with the big marshmallows so mini marshmallows will work or regular size it doesn't really matter it's whatever you're happy with then just stir it and watch it let it sit every now and then so it can melt and make sure to pay attention when it gets pretty melted the next thing that you're going to do is add some vanilla extract again I didn't measure I just pour it in until I was satisfied [Music] and then I threw in my rice krispies treats I'd say maybe about two cups maybe four cups actually because my cups that I use were pretty big not really that sure but I put in a pretty good amount of the rice krispies inside of it once you pour it the next thing that you're gonna do is just take your spatula and fold it [Music] okay and then go ahead and add in your mini chocolate chips this again you don't have to do this this is just my preference I like them in there you could melt them separately and then like drizzle it on top but I like them to be incorporated into it so I'm gonna go ahead and mix that in move back over to our baking pan it should just slide right out of the pan nice and easy if you don't have a non-stick pan then it probably won't be that easy but for me it worked pretty well and just scrape it all in there and right after you're going to Pat it down to try and make it flat and push it into the corners this really isn't that hard to do but for some it might be [Music] we could also take your hands and cover them with butter and that can help press them down as well the whole point of the butter is just so that it doesn't stick to you - pretty good hack I guess [Music] [Music] let it cool down to harden and then once it's cooled down and hardened on one type head and pre-cut it put some parchment paper on it and flipped it over and then removed the other parchment paper and just pulled it right off of it bring it there to dry and harden because that site is still really sticky now I already pre-cut it before I flipped it so this makes it easier you can either use your knife or you can just pull it apart like I did here in some spots that's easy because it's already pre-cut another spot that kind of like mend it back together so so yeah and that is it I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I hope they were just as delicious for you guys bye",

igniter ol on the request poner along behind the camera okay cup my guillotine asana move you know head repercussion which is 12 tables are you starting on June 30 I got the measuring things a little trade on the lowest upon 800 ILS too far mom mom because we need to have like a you know you look professions it's a bowl way we need we know what do you want an extra buttery melts in your mouth best video of my cereal guys look in the back of a box Wow we don't need this for you you have instruction refresh effect at all do you want to crispy in your mouth yeah it was not really helpful it was like a whole article who listen I believe No okay so you know make it crispy okay 1/4 cups great value butter okay so giving the butter great value because you get it everybody 1/4 cup okay okay so we're putting 1/4 cup thank you know little bit in here we need I'm thinking advance ounces of marshmallows 10 ounces how much is in here chances no need 10 ounces top perfect my ticket was wrong we don't need math it's already there I even high hmm oh yeah no when I sell those 10 ounces stop beating them ears man that's what I'm saying that's all together it looks like everything has to be together at one point at one point but all I'm the corporate noise did you have to melt this one tsp vanilla extract is patrasche because you guys one tablespoon you guys nothing not so prepare for TB yeah right there yeah like six cups oh he's not gonna fit in it six cups or what rice krispies that you know when you put the bowl with water and then over this no we messed up you need to put my guess it would burn them I think we can't melt in MA [Music] okay so we have to put it over water and then stir it up bolita are you this and I was innocent I pick up because come with this uh oh yeah sweet I could feel them after the burning because I could feel the heat okay so we're gonna wait for it to melt okay [Music] you look at it it's nothing that looks like freaking tea you okay get

recipe now if the Easter is dawning upon us and a big thing around Easter is chocolate and I love making healthy alternatives so this is a lovely slightly healthier alternative of the classic chocolate rice krispies cake so what's so great about this recipe is it's so easy and so here we have coconut oil just mixed with cocoa powder or cacao powder you can use a high-grade cocoa powder or raw cacao powder and we have the honey going in here but if you're vegan you can use an agave or something or coconut sugar but other than the honey heads is a vegan recipe which is great because I'm not vegan but I do like making vegan desserts and things and then I'm just going to add the nut butter into this so we have half a cup and this will just make it like gooey adds to the taste I love Pippin not because it is a slightly smoother consistency it's softer so it's a lot easier for things like this we'll have a couple of drops of vanilla essence and mix that in here we have some whole grains puffed rice you can buy from pretty much any supermarket pour this into here so we're just going to mix that's together here add the raisins you don't have to add raisins but I love the slightly chewy hard texture when you put them in the fridge or freezer now you can add nuts to this you can add some flax seeds you can trial some things out with this but this is a very simple version and then all you do is spoon them into here so now we're going to put them into the fridge or the freezer to set until they're hard and crispy so here we have the finished product they've been in the fridge for a couple of hours now and they are solid and crispy and give it a little bit of a taste so delicious so you can find the recipe below super easy make it for your friends and family

you get the notification or whenever we have a new video all right babe what we see at the end of the video [Music] [Laughter]", "mGlMP4KJHzs": "[Music] hey everyone my name is Jesse and welcome to my channel so with Thanksgiving come and gone I decided to start my Christmas videos and so in honor of think Christmas and an honor of this being my very first video ever on my channel I thought that I would meet some holiday treats and I'm kind of thinking about making this a two-part video where i'll be making treats and this one and in my next video i will be making some holiday drinks so be sure to subscribe and hit that on a vacation bell so that you'll be notified whenever I upload that video but without further ado let's get into it okay so the first you want to just go ahead and prep your pan that way whenever your rice krispies treats are made then you'll be able to just like plop it right in without having to worry about it so I have an 8 by 8 pan along with some parchment paper and what you want to do is spray it with some nonstick cooking spray so not your rice krispies treats won't stick to actual parchment paper art to the pan just one end so you just want to spray it really good so that it doesn't stick and so now that the ice paper just gonna stick it to the side for now and then we're going to get started on making our actual rice krispies treats okay so you put our pants aside so now what we're going to do is make our actual marshmallow fluff so you need about 4 ounces of butter and then you're going to need some marshmallows but you can use either one full bag of mini marshmallows alrighty can use half a bag of jumbo Mushmouth whichever you have on hand are whichever you're able to find this story either one is fine just whichever one you want and so then we're just going to melt our butter add our marshmallows and mix it all together ok so I'm on my stove now and what you want to do is go ahead and melt your butter and then once your butter is all melted then you want to your marshmallows I guess my continued melting it okay our butter has melted some now we want to go ahead and add our marshmallows okay I went ahead and added my marshmallows and now you're just going to med some marshmallows into the butter till it's all nice and melted and incorporated together and you want to keep this on low heat so that nothing sticks or burns okay our marshmallows and butter have melted together looks so good right now and so now we are going to take it back to our prep station and add our rice krispies okay so our marshmallow and Biman should have melted nicely and just be careful it's really how you don't want to burn yourself and now we're going to pour it into our rice krispies treat I have about six tubs here and so now you're just going to mix it all together yeah all of that delicious marshmallow butter goodness now I don't know about you guys but I love marshmallow treats and I love making them during the holidays just because it's so festive you can I chocolate to it sprinkles you can make pretty much anything from it okay and now we're just going to mix it together and then you have a rice krispie treat okay we have our rice krispies treats so now we're just going to put them in our little can that we have here that we're a prepped and having your pan prepped ahead of time it's just so much faster and easier to do and work with so I would definitely prep your pan before starting making them oh schedules faster okay and now we're just going to even it out into the pan okay so we have our rice krispies treats and some Maori is going to set this to the side and let it cool down and then once I pull down then we can get to decorating okay now that I rice krispie treats have cooled down and set I went ahead and cut them into squares you can make him as big or as little as you want and I went ahead and melted some more chocolate and so what you want to do is go ahead and dip them you want to go up out like halfway just like that and down and then you want to get any topping to you again you want to make sure that it's still what we just like that then we're going to green and I'm gonna go ahead and do that to the rest of my Rice Krispies okay now that I've decorated all of my rice krispies treats I'm gonna go ahead and I've let these cool down okay still on to our nut shell I'm going to be making some chocolate-covered pretzels and so what you'll need is some pretzel sticks and some red and green chocolates I already went ahead and melt at the same time and any toppings I have sprinkles a red and green you can also use I have these candy cane crumbs and so does anything that you want to talk about you can do different colored chocolates you can do other candies whichever you prefer I'm gonna go ahead and show you how to make these okay so what you want to do is go ahead and grab your pretzel stick and dip it into the chocolate and try to get as much of as possible to get covered all right if you want go halfway that's up to you however much chocolate prefer I liked lots of chocolate and so just when I cover it and just swirl it around and just like that and you want to put it on your parchment paper and then you're going to do the same with your green [Music] and so you just want to make sure it's all nice and evenly coated shake off any excess just so there's no like mess to try to avoid but hey and while your chocolate is still warm you want to go ahead and put your toppings on it so I'm going to do is I'm going to do the green sprinkles on my red and then I'm going to do my red sprinkles on my green and I'm going to continue that with the rest of my pretzels [Music] okay and then you have in my holiday treats I really hope you like this video and if you did

flakes yes there is the same [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so really quick and easy right and I really had fun making this one so I hope that you can make yours as well soon thanks for watching [Music]", "4LljZCFzHX4": "hello everyone and welcome to another vlog we're doing something a little bit different today this is something that I actually did mention in my twenty peak seeking to while self distancing video and that is making a recipe and that recipe is rice krispies treats now I have never personally made rice krispies treats before or if I have I was very young and don't remember doing so so this is going to be a learning or relearning experience so please bear with me while I try to figure this out I have a couple recipes pulled up one is just a regular rice krispies treat recipe one is a fluffernutter rice krispies treat recipe which is basically rice krispies but you add peanut butter in so it's gonna hop right in so before we even get started with the recipe you're going to want to wash your hands because one you should always wash your hands before you handle food of any sort and two we are trying to catch coronavirus and the best way to battle coronavirus is washing your hands often for the plain rice krispies treat recipe you need five cups of rice krispies yes this is a rapid mac-and-cheese cooker no don't come for me please and then you also need a quarter cup of butter I am using vegan butter but you can use any butter I would assume and then you need seven ounces of marshmallow cream and then for the fluffernutter it didn't say how much peanut butter to use so I'm just gonna use as much peanut butter as I feel like because I like peanut butter so if you decided to make it with peanut butter just put peanut butter into your own discretion because it's complete to taste as far as I know so the first thing we have to do is we have to get a 3 quart saucepan I don't know if this is 3 quarts but this is a saucepan that I have so we're using it so we take that and then we take our butter and we have to melt it so we're just gonna we're not gonna do that because that didn't work we're gonna use this spoon to scoop this butter out of the cup right and the next time you see this pot this butter is going to be melted all right so this butter is looking nice and melted and then you can see it and then our next step is to add in that marshmallow cream that we have so we're going to see how this works out because I don't know if you know but marshmallow cream is very sticky so I don't know how this is gonna work getting this out of the container and into the pan but we are gonna do my best and you're gonna wanna oh this is coming out actually a lot easier than I thought it would so you're gonna want to mix these on low because obviously you don't want your butter to evaporate entirely but you do want to be able to get your marshmallow cream to get nice and soft with this butter in here don't think we're gonna get much more out of this container try look at this guy has ever seen it Ghostbusters just feels like Ghostbusters oh right and we're just gonna mix this together while it's here on low and make sure it gets all nice and melty and softened before we add our nice crispy treats in all right this looks pretty nice and melted so we're gonna go ahead and take this off the heat and start living our Rice Krispies cereal all right so we have almost our melted marshmallow cream and butter mixture I don't have a pot holder so it's currently on some napkins leftover from my graduation party so we're just gonna set that on there we're gonna wash our hands again because I think I might end up having to use my hands to work the rice krispie treats or the Rice Krispies cereal into the treats so I'm gonna do that real quick and then we will start adding in our cereal all right so now that that is done we're just gonna go ahead and dump this whole of five cup serving of rice krispies into the marshmallow fluff and we're just gonna mix it see what happened so you're just carefully so it's not just fill it anyways just carefully kind of mixing this together I might have to go in here with my hands just to make sure that all of this is some marshmallow cream so far so good it looks you know how I imagined homemade rice krispie treats look I'm wondering if I didn't need more marshmallow cream but uh I don't know we're just doing kind of see how it goes yeah I'm gonna go ahead and hands in here and see how that works I promise I just washed my hands literally you can still see they're kind of wet but uh I stick my hands in here they're gonna get all sticky is it worth it I think it's worth it whoo she's warm friends I don't know if people usually use their hands to make rice krispie treats but uh it's something we're doing today you know so do you have any experience with making rice krispie treats if so tell me your stories down below in the comments okay this was immediately regretted all right this I'm gonna go back to using the spoon so learn from my mistakes kids don't use your hands to make rice krispies treats because it's just gonna stick to you and it's not gonna stick together so BRB alright back from freshly washing my hands this looks pretty evenly mixed there are a few little chunks of marshmallow cream throughout but ultimately I think this is probably about as good as we're going to get so it looks like how I imagined rice krispies treats in a plot would look so oh I just sent some flying that's embarrassing I'm so sorry please don't look up to me for your aspirations I have literally no idea what I'm doing okay so once your mixture is as mixed as it is going to get you're going to take I'm supposed to take a tray to put your rice krispies treats in but I don't have a tray I have a cupcake pan so I'm gonna do six of just the rice krispies and marshmallow mixture and then I'm gonna do six I'm gonna add some peanut butter into that mixture see how that works out so oh that was so loud I'm so sorry so let me get situated a little bit here and I would be right back alright so for this thing I'm gonna use my hands maybe I haven't decided a little bit I guess this rice krispies concoction is ready to like pop into the pan because it's just popping out of my pot right here we're just gonna start scooping this and you're just gonna want to push it in here and then you're going to want to flatten it out a little bit umm I have no idea how this is gonna work in like individual little cubby holes I guess but we'll see once it gets hardened a little bit so uh I'm just gonna keep scooping and pressing and you want to press this down as flat as you can I would assume it wouldn't matter more in like a flat like cake pan or brownie Kenmore because you'd want it to all be even but with this being kind of individual little circles of rice krispie treat I guess it doesn't really matter all that much so I'm just kind of playing it by eye some of these might be a little bigger than others and you know what that's okay because in life not everyone is going to be the same size rice krispies treat someone will be bigger you know some will be those like little tiny snack sizes that you put in lunchboxes some will be those big like king sized ones that you get at the gas station for like a dollar no one's here to judge we are just we are all here to be the rice krispies in life I'll be different this is really stupid analogy I'm gonna stop now all right well that worked out kind of perfectly I have about half of my rice krispies mixture left so what I'm going to do is melt my peanut butter in a separate cup in the microwave that way it's nice and soft and malleable and then I will go ahead and mix it in with the rice krispies and then finish out my little you ain't never had a friend like me all right so I'm gonna head and got my peanut butter out of the microwave this is kind of what it looks like I didn't want it to get too burnt and become hard so now that that is done I'm just gonna pour this anywhere into my rice krispies mixture and we're gonna watch it get burnt a little bit it's okay it's a learning experience you know and I'm having fun I don't know about you guys but I'm having fun all right so peanut butters in looks like that was a fairly decent amount for this serving of rice krispies so we're just gonna mix this up again hopefully this will heat up the marshmallow cream a little bit too this looks like it's starting to harden a little bit this looks nice now you can also add other like sprinkles and stuff I guess toppings seasonings that's not the right word like you can put in more marshmallows for reason if you for example if you want like marshmallow chunks in your rice krispies treat you can have marshmallows I know a lot of us who do actually have marshmallow as an ingredient not just the marshmallow cream you can add probably almost anything that you want in my news Reese's Pieces probably add some like pretzels and stuff in here if you wanted make it like trail mix but a Rice Krispies bars the possibilities are kind of in this pan to do just about anything with it all right so this looks pretty nice and mixed so we're gonna you know some of this stuff over here I'm just gonna move the tray over here and then we're just gonna get to work don't forget to watch your hands again before you put more rice krispies treats in there because believe it or not your hands are gonna get pretty dirty between doing every single stuff for this so all right let's start actually in the non peanut butter treats all right nice nicely nice I like the slight color difference from adding the peanut butter it's really nice well you know what I bet would go good in these those like peanut butter chips that they have mmm on top of the peanut butter I just really like peanut butter her friends all right I want to make sure I have enough for each little cup first and then I'll add more to top off the other ones [Music] so how's life going friends how are things how are you spending your days in quarantine I am really interested to see what you guys do drop a comment tell me what's been going on how are classes online of hearing classes are you on FaceTime with your friends as much as I am because I can't be with them in person let me know I would love to hear from you on seeing comments on my videos really brightens my day and I try to respond to each and every one of them so if you want me to notice you definitely post a comment because I will definitely reply back my last little school so I've had some there so we're somewhere [Music] all right and that does it for a rice krispy mixture we've got some nice little individual rice krispies treats here so we have six of the regular ones and then we have six fluffernutter rice krispies treats neither of the recipes that I used said anything about how long it takes for them to settle and harden but from previous mermaids I know that they put it in the fridge to like chill so what I'm gonna do is take our little tray and I'm gonna set it in the fridge for 30 minutes and then we'll check back and see how they're doing hey Siri set a timer for 30 minutes your timer is thank you right in 30 minutes we are going to see how our rice krispies treats are doing yes I just washed my hands before touching these they still feel a little I don't know if I play they're gonna come out Oh pretty much [Music] but I don't know I feel I think it'd still be a little bit so I will probably put this back in a friend to taking this video I'm gonna go ahead and get one and eat one I'm going to pick one of the peanut butter ones and put my spoon away probably needed it alright also I forgot to mention you were supposed to lightly grease this pan with butter before you put your stuff in which I did do but I forgot to tell you to do that so before you put your rice krispies mixture in and make sure that you butter your tray we don't we're gonna try this fluffernutter rice krispies dream it's very nice it's very light and airy but you need to taste some peanut butter so I think that was about maybe 1/4 a cup of peanut butter that I put in the microwave and melted so if you want it to taste like peanut butter and do at least a quarter cup more if you would like more peanut butter you could also try it with less just to see how that works out but um yeah this is really good I'm proud of myself I'm not the best in the kitchen and I know this wasn't like a high-energy recipe or anything like that but it's um a nice place to start out it's really good it was very simple easy to make I highly recommend it I will link the recipes that I used for these two different crispy treats in the comments or in the description of this video down below if you guys make this please let me know how it went it might be a little hard to make this if you don't have like marshmallows or Rice Krispies cereal or right a marshmallow cream at home this is not something that I normally keep around but my roommates that moved out recently left this stuff here so I was like why not I don't have anything else to do I'm in quarantine why not so I made them so this might be something that has to wait until after quarantine and whatnot or if you're able to find this stuff in your area at a grocery store go for it but don't put yourself in danger and don't do anything like that but this was a really nice recipe both of them and I think it turned out pretty great all right you know the drill by now if you have any questions comments ideas for videos songs you want me to cover leave them down below in those comments thank you all so much for watching and I hope you have a wonderful week bye everyone", "6kGPNAJ1OHo": "[Music] hi everyone i'm tasha i'm sophia and today we're making rice krispie treats but special kinds i'm going to make it with some morning toast crunch and i'm doing fruity pebbles um to make our rice krispie treats we will need six tablespoons of butter about eight ounces of marshmallows um and vanilla and then just for extra fun if we want we can add sprinkles and we're going to line our pans after we're done making the rice krispies with parchment paper so it doesn't stick so most sticks of butter have these little marks on them to show you how many tablespoons is in each stick each stick is eight tablespoons and as tasha said we only need six so we're going to cut it right there and put this in the pot to melt to melt your butter and your marshmallows you're going to want to put your stovetop on to a medium heat [Music] after your butter has melted completely that's when you're gonna start adding your marshmallows you want about eight ounces so what you're gonna do for a bag this size which is 10 ounces that will say that over here on the corner you're gonna add all of it until you've got maybe that much left and just for ease so i don't overdo it i'm just still gonna use a cup just to kind of control the flow let's see where we're at still need a little bit more and i feel like that should be good and now you're going to stir them in and you're going to stir constantly because you don't want to burn your butter or your marshmallows and you're going to stir them until they're creamy sauce so once it kind of looks like this not even kind of once it looks like this you're going to take it off the heat bring it back to the counter and put it on a heating pad so as to not burn your counter and that is when you're going to add your cereal you will add six cups of your cereal of choice like i said i'm doing cinnamon toast crunch and when you see sophia she'll be doing rooney pebbles i'm using a half cup measure so i have to do 12 half cups so this is four half cups once you have all your cereal in you are just going to mix it over and over again until all of it is covered in that gooey gooey stuff and then if you have marshmallows over and this is something sophia and i both really enjoy you're gonna put in a couple more of those little tiny marshmallows so as you eat your rice krispies treats you get like whole bites of marshmallows and it just adds to the texture and makes it so much more delicious and fun and because i'm a little jealous of sophia's fruity pebbles because i love color and i want some added color i'm i'm going to be adding some sprinkles so it's a little bit more fun to look at while i eat it i love it i just mixed it all in until there's no more uneven chunks of that marshmallow butter mixture and then i'm gonna add a few extra marshmallows for the chewy texture as well now after you have it all mixed up you will put parchment paper in your pan that you're going to put it in to help it form and since we forgot to do that brian is our magical helper today i think he's going to put it in for us i'm going to add a few more marshmallows [Music] and when you're ready and it's all mixed in if you need to ask for help like brian's helping me out so the paper doesn't move around and you're really just gonna like clump this all in so be very careful because the pot is still hot so if you need to have someone hold that as well if you have more people in your house and i'll kind of just like pump it out like this that looks great thanks i'm really excited to try this i've never had this kind before all right once it's in in there you're not going to push hard because you don't want it to get too stick stuck together because it'll be too hard to eat so you are just going to like gently move it around and just give it a little pat patch to help it have some form there we go and now it's so filled so since this pan is bigger i can choose to spread them out further and make them a little bit thinner than sasha's or i could just like only use half the pan and still make them thick but i think i'm going to make them a little bit thinner because then they'll set up faster so one way to get your rice krispies or whatever cereal treats you use to set up quicker is to put them in the fridge because that way the temperature cools down and they get solid faster when it is set and ready to eat you're just going to kind of cut it like a normal squares however size you want [Music] so we have one attaches right here tasha one with the cinnamon toast crunch and sprinkle probably incredible you got one of sophia's right here sophia chose the fruity pebbles normally not a fan of fruity pebbles but that that might turn me over there", "d1Jtgsxgm1E": "um cookie with Miss Jessica we're gonna make three ingredients cereal bars are you ready cuz I'm ready we're gonna start with wash my hands I'll be

peanut butter and honey are mixing together in their heating we're going to line our pan with our wax paper once your mixture is complete we're gonna add our three cups of Cheerios perfect okay we're just going to dump that into our pan you're really careful with your pop because it's still hot might need some help on this I'm just gonna put it in here looks pretty good and then we're gonna put

the knife you don't cut your fingers and these are perfect to have for breakfast or a snack and you'd snack in the morning all right let's try delicious thanks for cooking with me we'll see you next time", "zq2lJIYfGLA": "there are much martial breaks where you think out loud what could possibly go wrong with this plan welcome back yeah there you go there you have it welcome back as you all know Steve Harris celebrated national toasted marshmallow Day a day early with sugar about sweet shop yesterday they almost set the fire place on fire but he didn't bring us back any marshmallows so we decided to have a little fun in the kitchen with marshmallows today and make funfetti cake batter rice krispie treats Katie and I had fun in the kitchen with marshmallows buddy do you have anything this is a nine am sure you don't need to go down those avenues oh so we found this recipe on all recipes which the Meredith Corporation does own that so everyone stand at attention so you need a lot of ingredients you're probably gonna have a lot of this right maybe I can have butter I don't know butter butter but you don't I don't own butter but if you do you need a half a cup of butter what we have now you know thoroughly melted yeah that worked out well Sam the voting took right on okay so you also need um marshmallows right you need bourbon ah let me repeat that two tablespoons of bourbon okay let's go okay well so you want to start mixing alright so you got a line the nine by thirteen inch cake pan with some parchment paper which we've already done you got to melt the butter which we've already done that takes three to four minutes now you got to put the marshmallows in there to melt it down that's gonna take like most of the time we get outside here's all of thats gotta go butter with the butter and you got to stir that puppy and make sure you still got heat going because the butter is gonna help the butter and the heat from the stone there's more and Sam told me we need I don't know like a quarter maybe of the marshmallows that are in this bag as well we're supposed to wait till this is all melted but I haven't yes that's not got a quarter that bag - yep then you add the Bourbon mm-hmm you just jumped right to the good part didn't you can we go ahead and add it now well technically yeah I would I would but you basically you don't you want to help cut down so you got what did you say - tablespoon right and then a teaspoon of salt which I think she's mellowed out right up there and then and now this is something I've never done with rice krispies treats before Sam come over here we're gonna I may have turned this down too much what we're gonna mix cake mix what did you yes this I've never done this with rice krispies cheese so you see the box right up there and you can get you one longer that's got like the little oh I just want to make sure it's turned up all barking orders at everybody I don't dude I don't trust him for a second he knows that I work the dial she knows every producer Sam feel on warm enough and then do we add the cake back yeah you're gonna put the cake mix into the marshmallow mixture until that's dissolved when wasn't it I was waiting to add the Bourbon until it was a little more okay oh it is melting it's getting down there oh yeah now see that again this is something I've never done with the rice krispies treats it's the funfetti you can go out and buy a box of Pillsbury height:30px or dump it right in there but I've never had it with rice krispies treats now for then once that's kind of dissolved you can actually take it off the heating what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix in half of the extra rice krispies get off before we do this five cups you only put in half right now no here's half the rice cereal and a half of the half of the way five cups so I don't know what does it say it says half the rice here okay and then we were put in five and then and then half the fruit flavored cereal as well so only half of that bowl you're gonna mix the remaining rice cereal fruit flavored cereal into the mixture after you feel like the first has been even a coat so we're just kind of going in phases here so you don't you don't wind up with the whole thing rice your clothes I'm cramping up feeling the burn well you got to work those biceps a little harder okay it's pretty much mixed up okay okay if you feel like it's mixed then add the rest of those dry cereal in there too so now we're going back in with the second half wrap it up now we're gonna need another seven minutes or so yep so we need one more half then once you feel like that is evenly coated you're gonna press all of that into your parchment paper lined castering gloves I think she's doesn't she's she's instagramming over there she has no idea what you're talking about where we supposed to use now I'm getting worried well she's asleep or something that's all I wouldn't worry about it sure it's fine Wow mr. arrow dreamers office use my stinger no picnic for me they're cheating why did you break it all right yeah we did get a rap by the way just so if anyone's keeping score in your head oh yeah that's still on dumper in there I'll tell you what from this angle this is a really unpleasant moment like this worked out okay well it ain't done yet and then then you got to press this inlet here just write it back on the burner and after this it just sets yeah you gotta set it up for 20 minutes or so I think and they actually say you can sprinkle a little sea salt oh yeah time yeah when that upshore me hit the button so I know what in the world's going on", "ii3_BeQRx6s": "hey the campers my name is miss kaya and today i will be making another treat for you today's treat will be the rice krispie treats for this treat you will need rice krispies cereal marshmallow chocolate chips butter measuring cups and i have one that's one cup and one that is a one-third cup toothpicks a small bowl for chocolate a bowl for the rice krispie treats and marshmallows and a spatula for mixing a knife and a plate for the end before we start make sure that your hands are clean and your work surface is also clean the very first step is to get three tablespoons of butter so i have the markings and i'm just going to use the knife to cut it and make sure you're being careful with the knife once i have a butter i'm just going to put it into this bowl that i have here in this bowl we're also going to do the four cups of marshmallows so now that i have my marshmallows and butter i'm going to put this in the microwave for two minutes and i'll be right back just remember when it's time to take out your boat from the microwave be really careful or use a towel or ask someone older or an adult to help you take it out because the bowl will come off super hot so after those two minutes are done it will look like this and you will give your spatula to mix the marshmallows and butter around once you're done mixing you will put it in the microwave for one more minute and start once it's done so now that one minute is done i'm going to start again the next step is to get our rice krispie treats and we're going to put in six cups of rice krispie treats once i have all my rice krispie treats i'm going to use the spatula to mix it and make sure you're flipping the rice krispies treats so that the marshmallow and butter covers all of the rice krispies it also might be helpful to use your hands so that it don't fall off the bowl or just to mix it because it might be a little easier and it's messy but that's fine because the marshmallows are sticky so once it's all mixed together it should look something like this and the very next step is using our hands so we're going to get a little bit like like this amount and we're going to roll them into balls like this and once we roll the ball you'll just sit it on your plate all your rice crispy treat mixture if you want to because you can make as many as you want and another thing is we're making them ball shaped but if you want to make regular rice krispie cheese you can sip them on a pan and cut them into rectangles and then you'll just have the normal rice krispies treats but these are fun so we're going to put them into another thing is that it'll be better to ball them up once it's cooled down so that way you won't burn your hands so so i didn't use all my mixture but i did make a few and i just shaved them like this and the very next step now is to get our toothpicks and however many you made we're gonna put one toothpick into each one so this is how they look with all of the toothpicks inside of them now the next step is to get our chocolate and we're going to do 1 3 cup of chocolate you could do as much chocolate as you want but since i'm not covering all of mine with that much chocolate then i'm only using one third for the 10 that i have so it really all depends on how many you make how much taco you want how much chocolate you like and then we're going to put our chocolate into this bowl put this in the microwave for 30 seconds once that time is done you'll use your spoon and mix it up and then you'll put it in for 30 more seconds and stir it again once all the chocolate is stirred up the very next step is to get one of the rice krispies and dip it in chocolate and it'll be like this at the top and you'll do that to as many as you want to but i'm not doing it to all of them and for some of them you can even drizzle chocolate on them some of them look i have some plain ones with no chocolate some with drizzled chocolate and some that were just dipped in chocolate so this is how they look and now we're going to try one together so they taste pretty good and this is a good and easy treat to make and like i said before you can make the rice krispie treats on the pan those that are the ones that are bar shaped and another thing you can do with these is if you want you can add sprinkles or any other topping to your rice krispie treats and you can also use other cereals so you can use cocoa pebbles you can use fruity pebbles because those also work the same as rice krispie treats so i hope you all enjoyed today's treat and i'll be back next week with another one bye", "Ak6PFz9b5Ko": "hey guys we're back again so today we're gonna do some couples chocolate yeah some chocolate rice krispies so we have some marshmallows Rice Krispies chocolate and we're going to show you how to do it oops let's get the right get it Misha 1 jul okay I got the other one okay so let's get started yeah a little delay here 3 tablespoons of butter so here's the butter that's about up to here and we'll post the recipe it within the description link do we have the cup measuring cup bring the Versa pana look melt butter in large sauce pan on low heat add marshmallows allow you forgot to do that cups this is 10 else's and a half this is 10 ounces should we add a little more no fine we're gonna have the and then we're to have bananas we're not a domestic Jonathan's like a banana freak six cups I just pour it in here right I've made rice krispies since I was like a kid I've never made i don't think i've ever made him actually I've never oops it says app and sprayed with cooking spray this is going to go read the directions before you try these marshmallows looks delish all right coconut oil we're doing for some reason it smells like McDonald's from rice there that when you do hipster well here hold on one second all right and you have to keep stirring the marshmallow until it melts with the butter take it add cereal but is it wrong again materials here yeah so I think it's the same thing though I mean yeah just fixing everything oh now we're talking oh wow so I'm gonna cut hold on your count the cups those two three wait we know what that we don't have enough nationalist it's like early enough what you don't do it you should be doing wrong add this no cuz it takes a while to its fine we should use your four cups well there's this little extra here it's going to be contaminated let's cut that then throw it out because look then it's not going to take good it's just yeah but you see that's fine yeah just turn off the heat yeah we should have melted the chocolate before I will just add in there it's so harder you want to switch again some us alone Oh what are you saying what are you trying to say there okay okay more chocolate the workout guys we want to do if you if it's like arm day she totally do Rice Krispies and then oh yeah work it what's the results here we almost done we got to put it into the pantry yeah they're afraid you see if Cameron is uh coming probably out here for like 10 min oh it's only seven-thirty okay let's put it into the pan should we just throw it on top of those chocolate chip buddy we didn't fill the pan you needed more much noise so follow the recipe pull Jonathan don't follow yeah we do terrible oh no she tastes good job see now what's this does it have to be refrigerated or just this is cool I think I should be frigid never refrigerated Rice Krispies then it's gonna be hard as a rock there you have it we'll have our friends test test it and see they'll tell you the truth oh you know why you needed to put on cooking spree what so they don't stick to the plan no that's what we got the cooking oil hey we're back and we got a little bit of rice krispies left how worth it they were really good I think you sure yeah so good that we almost finished it yeah but the only thing is that you definitely have to add marshmallows because they fall apart okay we're falling apart a little bit and they're not as like chewy as a regular rice krispies because we didn't put enough marshmallows but overall they're really really good so if you have the same amount of marshmallows unless Rice Krispies if you have enough marshmallows to six cups yeah so go follow the directions will link it below see you next time tell us what we should cook necks or try to cook next subscribe", "tSpzG-iO9lA": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel i miss thc and i'm here to show you how to make cereal bars so you're going to need 40 of the large marshmallows 6 cups of your favorite cereal you're going to need four tablespoons of canna oil and one teaspoon of vanilla extract and then of course you're going to need a pan to press it down in i've already sprayed it with pam um it's just easier to get it back out of the pan if you spray it so without further ado let's get started the first thing you're gonna do is take your bowl of marshmallows and you're gonna add the can of oil this is the funnest part adding your medicated stuff i always just use the lids for stuff to hold my stuff in your vanilla extract a teaspoon vanilla extract and then you're just gonna heat this in the microwave for a few minutes until it is melted all right guys so we've got it smooth and creamy now mine took about a minute and 15 seconds to get creamy like this i don't really like telling people how many minutes to do because each microwave is different but mine took a minute and 15 seconds i think the safest way to do it is maybe 30 seconds check it 30 seconds check it et cetera so now that you've got it all creamy like that you're going to add all of your cereal oh my gosh this is going to be good and you just start folding it all in it starts getting harder and harder to do it's all springing up on you so make sure you scrape it from the bottom of the bowl fold it up to the top just keep on reaching from the bottom of the bowl all nice and incorporated and like i said you could use any cereal any cereal you want i would stay away from like filled cereals like the chocolate crave and all those that are filled and maybe stay away from flakes oh i got some on my hand that means i get to lick it off guys [Music] all right don't you feel like you got it all incorporated you start plopping it in your pan that you have sprayed get it all in there try to work fast it looks like a bunch of cobwebs all over the place and you know what if it does dry if it starts drying out like this you can pop the bowl right back in the microwave re-melt it and just pour it right over the top which is what i think i'm probably gonna do [Music] and then you better just start mashing it on [Music] try to get it flat sometimes it's hard because it wants to slide around in the pan and kind of sprayed it get back in there mash it all down get all these little pieces in there i'm making a mess all right guys so i heated my bowl up and i got the rest of the little the goodies out so what you want to do is try to get it really really flat spray your hands with that oil otherwise if you don't as soon as you start pressing down it's just gonna pick right up on your hand press it all down in there try to get it as even as you can because you're gonna be cutting these into even portions so you can measure out your thc per dose and you want to try to be as accurate as you can see some places have a little bit more marshmallow than others but that's okay sometimes too if you have another pan exactly the same size you can actually spray the bottom of that pan and use it to press it down but i think this is doing pretty good all right so you just keep pressing it down i'm a bit of a perfectionist so it probably won't take you this long i'm just a stupid perfectionist there i think that's pretty good you can put whatever you want on it you just put sprinkles on it or whatever but i mean these aren't child treats so you don't want to make them too enticing for you know a kid or something you want to make sure that everyone in your house knows that these are medicated and don't touch keep them completely separate from the rest of the goodies that you make and to be fair make sure you're making goodies for everyone not just medicated stuff all the time if you've got other people in the house that don't you know indulge or you know our patients or whatever so here it is now you just want to let it sit for a few minutes you can already tell as you're pushing that it's getting solid and stiff so you just want to maybe wait a couple hours something or maybe not even that long some people like to stick it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes just to make sure so that's what i'm gonna do so thank you so much for tuning in please subscribe and like and hit that bell so you can get some notifications when i put a new video up so stay tuned for pictures [Music]", "hycgT6PHEzs": "[Music] hey yamcha she'll say Lucien Debray yo on a recipe I actually wanted to do this earlier I thought it would really be a good Halloween recipe but I have been down with the finest pride and fighting that for two weeks so I didn't get it done and I apologize for the binoy I guess you're going I'm doing a video so what we're gonna be doing today is butter fingers chocolate rice krispie treats oh I gotta make this and I found this blog a cooking blog I want you by calm and I'll put a link below to this actual recipe so that if you're interested you can go and get it and make it yourself so let's start out with what we're gonna need we're gonna need eight cups of chocolate rice krispies I got my box there three cups of minutes for marshmallows we've got some butterfingers fun-sized butterfingers which was I removed so to remove the wrapping and half them so you can eat one 11.5 ounce bag this is actually a 22 ounce bag and [Music] but I'm not going to use these because I don't want that quite a bigger chunk of butter fingers in these so what I'm going to use in place of that are these where they're already crunched up for me and this is 10 ounces yep close enough so we're gonna replace that you're also gonna need six peanut butter cups which we're going to quarter up you're gonna need some creamy peanut butter two tablespoons of honey or maple syrup it says a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon optional getting the dark melting chocolate today oh all right I'm going to clear this off and start measuring stuff up we'll be back donar eight cups of rice krispies in here and that was almost the whole box that was a fifteen point five ounce boxes you know there might be one one cereal bowl I'm going to add three cups of marshmallows that's not eight I've already got them in the bag of the Butterfinger chunks taking bit easier color and I have sliced up the butter peanut butter cups ideas a little smaller than quarters just for my own personal preference probably just as well these their hands [Music] firstly I think that looks like it could use a little more marshmallows but I'm gonna stick to the rest of money for now alright so that's it for the dry ingredients I'm gonna get set up over here on the double boiler and all right [Music] [Music] up against the mill strike constantly whether these things take care not to allow anything or moisture to escape from the pot alone oh that's kind of impossible for it's not the state okay once you chocolates on the smelted I'm gonna stir in the peanut butter the honey or maple syrup and ground cinnamon I think I'm either going to not put the cinnamon in there I don't for some reason it may add a little more flavor to it but I'm just not gonna pull it just say it's awful good so alright once we start getting this melted and get ready to add peanut butter I'll bring you back alright we've got our chocolate melted down a good way into the rope this one for 2/3 of a cup of peanut butter I don't feel like dirtying up a measuring cup so I'm gonna say that I'm gonna say that's close enough oh I'm just gonna eyeball it my second peanut butter is a honey roasted peanut butter so I'd be pretty good alright so the way let's add our two tablespoons of honey and yeah like dripping son gets back in the jar [Music] [Music] back and get some rim on that see so oh yeah that's perfect timing on that chocolates all melted and when you're using a double boiler like this for those of you who have never used one before I didn't know what one was you really don't want your water boiling underneath there you just want it you know it will Sammy lift it up a little bit see that's just kind of steamy just want it where it'll heat this stuff up and melt it and you gotta get the peanut butter in there to get it next nice and sticky from the honey I don't have to say that's pretty well mixed and all the chocolate is melted now it says to let this sit and cool for about five minutes and that's probably so we won't melt all the marshmallows up too much before we pour it over the stuff so that'll give me time to clean up a little bit and rearrange my camera all right we cool down enough right spatula just in case I need it we're gonna start spooning this over yeah it's already starting kind of hardened let's do a little warm yeah spatula to get all that out of there I think I'm gonna need a more flexible spatulas all right start mixing this up in this yeah something tells me I probably should've put some gloves on because this is getting messy stand the bowl rice krispie treats are usually something you're gonna get messy with anybody some probably gonna end up getting my hands in here which they are cleaning I have washed them yeah this is here we go and you know what right there this to me really doesn't look like enough to do that to cover all this but okay you'll see we shall see working too well is it okay so let's just get our hands in here and mix and get as much of this off here as I can [Music] [Applause] yeah it's easier to do this by hand yes it's messy maybe put on some gloves if you don't want to get dirty all right let me move this out of the way and I have the parchment paper down in here but as you can see it's already popped back up got that placed we all can see it basting yeah kinda set the bowl down and scooch all right that's better oh sorry for reaching in front of the camera but this is not operating too well sorry no I'm blocking with you get the bowl out of here all right good enough okay it did say something about taking another piece of parchment paper and cut it you know get in there use it to press this down but since my hands already dirty I'm not gonna worry about it um I'm hoping what's this hardens up in the refrigerator I really think it needed a little more chocolate mixture myself so if I were to make this again I would probably I wouldn't want to buy two bags of those and melt that that would probably be too much so what I probably do is cut this back to maybe six or seven cups of rice krispies instead of eight that's just me all right we're gonna call that good swinging around at this point so now this is gonna go in the refrigerator for about at least four hours or overnight and it's gonna be about four hours for me before I pull this out and try them and hopefully they'll firm up pretty good so we're gonna go get washed up turn off the camera well here's our finished product of the rice krispie treats I've already cut it up as best I couldn't as you can see in here it's it's pretty crumbly it really fell apart so if I were to make this again I would probably cut the cereal back by at least one cup for sure maybe two that way I know the stuff could get enough moist of the wet mixture in there to bind it together so now let's let's do a little taste test I'm trying to find a piece it has a little bit of everything this piece looks like it does I'm just gonna do a ball small hmm very good very rich I definitely need a big glass of milk with one of these so there you go Butterfinger rice krispie treats just reduce the cereal by at least a cup and it shouldn't be quite so crumbly even crumbly though it's still very very good thank you for watching and we'll see you next time", "S13DII7t6X8": "modern arsebutt random tips today's episode is a simple tip turn your bottom of the bag cereal crumbs into tasty rice krispies treat granola on cereal bar hybrids hopefully this intro and pictures have inspired you already to make your own cereal bars with leftover crumbs I don't have a strict recipe to follow it's different every time but if you want to get more inspiration and watch some silly cooking by me and my family continue on also check in the video description for the ingredients I used in this video [Music] yeah it's the strawberry mini wheats because many weeks have the most crumb sweets many ways look at all the cereal bags holy cereal crumbs Batman do you throw away cereal crumbs well if you do this is a good look at how much cereal you could be throwing away over time and when you are gonna pour out the crumbs if you have a bag with the riesling top it's best to cut it off snip otherwise all of the crumbs are gonna get caught on the ziplock portion on the inside and then it makes it a lot easier to pour it which is the Applejack's copycats we're gonna make this tutti fruiti bag extra tutti frutti by putting every fruit flavor in there strawberry blueberry banana mango pomegranate there's no tango there's no Mingo what's a mango they should add a new flavor to the preserves Mingo yeah and they can also do what's another fruit flavor a mango durian what's that star fruit like great food yeah the great fruit cereal for daddy they should do a durian stereo what's the dairy in velvet no just have to look it up people what the dari\u00e9n do you are I am so I've already put in the butter to melt and here we've got our three teaspoons of vanilla extract we got one-fourth heaping teaspoon of salt and in here we've got chia seeds and crunched up pecans crunched up walnuts and half a cup of honey so these little cups are great for measuring tiny things or even just putting small measurements of tiny things so when you have little medicine cups when you're done with them don't throw them away keep them they're great for measuring tiny things and now comes the big part we're gonna put all of our leftover cereal crumbs into this bowl about seven cups worth just random cereals throw them together I usually put in a mixture of normal cereal not the crumbs like rice krispies and quick-cook oats but this time is gonna be mostly the serial crimes because I have a hoard stash of cereal crumbs so I've already put a few in there and I've got a bag of cocoa dynamite from some of the leftover troubles in there we're going to and you get all of the delicious sugar at the bottom of the bag normally I dump all of the cereal from the bags into one bag so you don't have a bunch of bags laying around so you save one cereal bag dump everything into it and then when you're ready you can add it to some kind of cereal bar rice krispies treat hybrid how many crumbs I'm gonna go ahead and put a little bit of quick-cook oats I don't want it to be entirely crumbs I've put a few rice krispies in there earlier too so you don't measure this you just kind of throw it all in there's actually measurements in there there's a seven right there all the measurements in cups nice big mixing bowl here's the honey because there's not enough sugar in the bottom of the bag it is honey [Laughter] the whole bag the whole bag a lot of times when I make this I just kind of guesstimate every time I make it it's different and I have a separate bag for all of the tutti-frutti x' and fruit loops and Captain Crunch berries anything that's fruity I put in a separate bag so if I feel like making a rice krispies treat canola bar cereal bar hybrid thingy that's fruity flavored then I put all the fruity crumbs in there for people who feel more fruity [Laughter] [Music] melted into the butter can never have too many marshmallows too much mousse the previous bag was open like kids snuck some marshmallows so I'm gonna compensate overcompensate a little bit some vanilla in this all on the subject of using medicine cups for small ingredients thinking about vanilla I also have this wonderful dropper that I use for adding vanilla to drinks makes it a lot easier than trying to pour it out so there's another little tip for you some motton are spit regarding vanilla all right we're pretty good and melted in here all of the honey and marshmallows and butter we're gonna dump all of the crumbs all of the fortified nutrients and vitamins and we're gonna process it together with some more processed stir we it's getting really thick and lumpy oh I almost forgot we got a dump in the healthy stuff the nuts and uh chia seeds JIAJIA [Music] yeah well now we're gonna now we're gonna eat the ants I don't want any actually and I should have turned off the heat a little sooner you only need the heat millet long enough to melt them smells like honey and it's pretty stickies in here so I'm going to add a few more of these well you want it to be sticky so it stays together yeah I know but it's like really sticky sometimes I'll add chocolate chips and peanut butter chips sometimes I'll add them at the end sometimes I'll add them into the melting part you know this is just kind of a get creative cereal bar it's never the same every time we should we should put it in butterscotch chips butterscotch chips butterscotch it's plenty sticky [Music] we got enough honey and sugars from the cereal crumbs and marshmallows to get this all to stick together really good butterscotch put in a few butterscotch booter sketch just work its got your word Scotch it is yeah describe to the combat word yeah it is indeed did you put chocolate cereal in there I put chocolate cereal in here I put cinnamon cereal in here I put honey cereal in here but bran cereal in here I put a lot of mini wheats of all the cereals out there mini wheats creates the most crumbs you eat mini wheats and you're throwing away the crumbs you're throwing away a lot of cereal over time and maybe you're someone who likes to puts the cereal crumbs into your milk and eat it no one in my family likes it no no cops [Music] I don't like crumbs yeah they get soggy and they coach your mouth yeah nice crispy what's the Malik butterscotch yep good butterscotch rice krispie treats creeping all the siding getting off mushroom I spread all this out across everywhere and I'm trying to make it smooth that's gonna get something to help with that okay did you spray it with no one greasy lick powell cup to go with a make power shirt you want to ask him if you can lick the spoon yeah yeah sure these are gonna be probably some of the biggest ones I've ever made yeah well that's better than when they all crumble when you're trying to eat them yeah those ones I didn't put enough marshmallow enough marshmallows but not too much you can never have too many many marshmallows you have too many of anything except for friends I like that that's very wise scrumptious warm like waffles it tastes like all sorts of different kinds of breakfast meals all at once fine thanks like cereal and mostly rice krispie treats in the fridge just to cool it down faster what do you think sit good yeah Rutina buyer there's actually no peanut butter in it yeah [Music] gooey and yummy", "ROWZ13vj-Ro": "hey everyone my name is Lauren Gao and you are watching another episode of life above the clouds your guide to elevated eating with a

Patrick's Day and I will see you guys next week thanks again for watching bye guys [Music]", "QvymEKXmFKM": "hi welcome to my channel vitamin peonies Embree I'm adjusting how I do my cooking videos and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start putting a little video like this at the beginning of an intro video like this at the beginning of all my cooking videos because I have such a small galley kitchen that it's very awkward for me to include myself my pots my stove and make it look visually appealing I guess because you can't really see me in my videos and I want you to focus on the recipe and the steps that we're going through not necessarily make it a focus on me but because you all do want to see me I want to give you exactly what you're asking for so in these videos I'm gonna tell you why the recipe is special to me and why I decided to make that recipe so in this video we're making rice krispies treats and the reason I pick rice krispies treats reason number one no heat and that's basically it and I live in Southern California right now and it is so hot that using my oven is a no-go I am NOT going to be baking for the remainder of the summer reason number two for me making the rice krispies treats for you it's because rice krispies treats to me are such a warm special memory and they remind me of the day that I met my uncle Frankie and my cousins and yeah it's just a warm happy memory for me I grew up in Puerto Rico around my paternal family so I never hadn't met my maternal family until we moved to Chicago when I was around 8 or 9 and the day that I met my uncle Frankie we went we watched Pocahontas we had dinner and then we went home and when we went home we had we made rice krispies treats I hope you guys also make special memories with these recipes with your children cuz I know a lot of you are watching these videos of mine with your kids and this is especially kid friendly recipe because there's no knives there's no heat there's so much room for improvisation and replacing ingredients you can just add whatever and be super adventurous with it and your kids will really love these because you can as long as you can make like rice krispies cake pops with them too as long as you buy the little steaks you can make a little balls and shape them that way it's just so much room for just room to be creative for that and definitely comment below and let me know what special ingredients you like to add do your rice krispies treats so yeah thank you for watching stay tuned today I'm making rice krispies treats the rice krispies treats is one of my favorite snacks one of my favorite candy bars treats whatever you want to call it it's a pretty easy to make usually it's gonna take butter marshmallows obviously Rice Krispies cereal or the equivalent in an off-brand version not a big deal you could add cookies Oreos any type of cookies Oreos you can add M&Ms mini M&Ms you can add nuts you could add candied fruit if you want it to make it more like cereal bars instead of like just a fun snack they're super easy super fun for this particular recipe I doubled it and it's 6 cups of rice krispies times 2 because I'm gonna make 2 different bars I have 2 10 ounce bag of marshmallows so you can get bigger or smaller marshmallows but you just got to make sure that the ounces are the same because then when it melts it's going to yield about the same so 10 to 10 ounce bags it doesn't matter what size they are you could go a little bit bigger 12 ounces 14 ounces or whatever it's just gonna be a little bit more marshmallow than you need but you could probably eat a few at one time a big deal salt because salt is not a flavor salt is a flavor enhancer and we're going to enhance the sweetness with some sea salt okay if you want to do make some fun shapes and stuff I got special cookie cutters that we can use to make the shapes fun different unique or you can just opt for cutting them into square rectangular shapes and then you can top them with a variety of different sprinkles and colors if you want and then you want you usually want to use vanilla extract but I have no vanilla extract so I'm actually going to use a coconut emulsion which is going to give it a hint of a coconut flavor just to make ours a little bit more unique and a little bit different than just the store-bought ones so yeah the cookies because I'm obviously not going to cook them herb mix them into the batter or into the mix in their normal shape I want to crunch them up I'm going to put them in a bag and then I'm going to roll them and smash them into smaller pieces but not dust but we want to break the cookies we don't want to pulverize the cookies okay mm-hmm and the trays that you want to finish them often are going to be whatever size tray you want usually a sheet tray sheet pan and you can use either wax paper or parchment paper and then you're gonna want to rub in some butter so that it doesn't stick or some cooking spray if you have cookies break okay and then I have another one over here this is a bigger one this is probably better if you're just doing one batch but I'm doing two batches so I have two sheet trays and this is parchment paper so you can use parchment paper or wax paper and I put both so that you could see it's gonna be the same thing okay it's six tablespoons of the butter because I doubled the recipe okay so six tablespoons to ten ounce bags and twelve cups of rice krispies treats okay then we're going to take it to the stove okay so we're on the stove turn it on medium heat and with the medium heat we wanted to put in your six tablespoons of butter they are going to melt in here take a little bit but you also want to use a nonstick pot or pan big enough for the marshmallows and the butter because you're going to have to stir it in here and coat the marshmallows with the butter until the marshmallow is completely melt okay that's going to take a few minutes and heat okay neat one addicted to marshmallows [Music] so one time now the child even groceries with my mom and I snuck and stuffed my face with these giant jumbo marshmallows and proceeded to choke on the marshmallows because I was trying to eat them before my mom could see me stealing the marshmallows so mother chubby self not really chubby but really only like food I start choking on the marshmallows like legit choking choking coffee I come up to my mother and I appear to be foaming at the mouth foaming at the mouth with marshmallows because obviously you can't really swallow four jumbo marshmallows at once when you're eight years old actually I don't think I can do that now that I'm an adult either but anyway that's it's my story about the marshmallows and being a kid addictive to marshmallows which is why don't buy marshmallows anymore because I would eat the whole bag in one sitting and probably choke on the market again so yeah here we are so now that the marshmallows are starting to melt in the butter I'll show you what it looks like looks like this okay make sure that burn yourself because the heat should be at a medium level right now you're gonna continue to stir the marshmallows which tell they're all we melted you're stirring so that they're not getting stuck or burning at the bottom so once they're all the way melted then you're gonna incorporate the rice krispies and all the other ingredients that you want to pour in so I'm gonna turn this down below because I see it melting a little bit faster over faster let me show you [Music] so you keep stirring until they're completely melted and you cannot tell the things to be marshmallows so we can end up being a creamy mixture in the bottom of your bag and like I said ideally you want a non-stick pan [Music] because this is very very sticky and sugary okay so you're gonna keep stirring ideally like a spatula or something flat so that you can get very close to the edges and about whatever's in the corners of your pans [Music] okay so stirring stirring [Music] okay so now that I've stirred it completely and the marshmallows are completely melted it's gonna look like this okay in turn at this point we gotta take this mix I'm gonna leave it on low just to keep it melted and we're gonna incorporate the cereal next see it's gonna look like that you're gonna make sure that it's when you mix it together with your cereal all of your cereal needs to be coated okay so we're going to cross the other side of the kitchen and work make sure together so now we're on the other side this is still warm because I kept it heated okay so I have two mixtures so we're gonna attempt to do half and half and this make sure I'm gonna put in rice krispies and minim minis pinch of salt I chose do two pinches of salt and coconut emulsion [Music] mixing in salts and the emulsion hopefully this is where it's gonna get tricky because I got to split this into two but if you're just doubling the recipe and making it just one simple simple individual flavor it'll be simple okay so we're trying to get just cap in here okay moving half I'm actually gonna move that out of the way but you can see what I'm doing and I'm going to mix the rice krispies and make sure that this is getting completely covered by the marshmallow and butter mixture you'll be able to tell because it'll start to glisten because obviously it's sugar and you can see it for it collects on the bottom if it's not coated it'll look dry this could stand to get a little bit more M&Ms in here but we're just gonna work with it you can still see them in there okay and you can see it starting to stick together that's how you know that you have coated them completely you need to get room temp it's gonna start to solidify and stick and form the little bar okay pink need better lighting but from the looks of it it is completely coated neck and some other melting chocolate actually delicious if you have children this would be a good step for them to sneak in and and mix it it'll be kind of fun it looks kind of like that quicksand that's the kinetic sand that kind of sticks together and like moves that's kind of like what you're looking for here [Music] okay so this is good what you want to do then those lines pans that we buttered up earlier we're going to pour your mixture and spread it out evenly onto your pan smell so good and I don't even like chocolate yes I'm a weirdo not a huge fan of chocolate but I like the smell of it okay get this pan out of the way [Music] and in this little batch we're gonna add golden Oreos we talked about the golden Orioles earlier and the golden Oreos have been rolled but not pulverized and I'm gonna throw them in now because I wanna mix in there okay and add my two pinches of sea salt I'm gonna mix it in before my marshmallow cools down to much and then because this is gonna be kind of a solid color here you can't really see the golden Oreos we're going to throw in some sprinkles for color oh yeah this is really coated in the marshmallow I can feel it sticking sensibiy little bit tougher my arm is getting a little bit tired so we're gonna throw in some blue sprinkles [Music] awesome and it went to throw in some orange sprinkles I'm gonna make them in here real quick [Music] oh yeah that looks so good wood looks fun there were other colors in here that be even better so these are the boldest colors I have okay and we are going to put these on their tray now in this way which is what I should have used for the other one but I only have one to do the same thing scoop it all out place it on your tray and try to smooth it out as evenly as possible you", "0aVnVeVyDFo": "hello friends I'm starting to dot this is the story tonight my boys and I are we're

yeah bye thanks for watching BS climates you like comment subscribe", "qsk_At_gjv0": "hi guys today I'm going to show you how to make my ultimate childhood snack chocolate caramel rice krispies treats they are so good and they only require four ingredients for ultimate chocolate caramel e deliciousness now the one thing that you do need is a Mars bar or if you're in America and Milky Way bar will do the job you want to get these into nice chunks that are going to melt down with a bit of butter and this essentially becomes the glue for these Mars bar rice krispies treats you are going to put these in with some rice krispies and you're gonna be left with crunchy caramel chewy googliness it's gonna be good okay these are looking pretty good so just tumble these into a Bowl that is sitting over a pan of simmering water and this is gonna melt down with quite a generous amount of butter so get that in there as well and at this point if you don't have Mars bars or you don't have Milky Way bars you could do this with just chocolate but I think you get so much more when you get that chewy deliciousness from the new gun the caramel and the chocolate so stick with me now the trick to getting a lovely gooey chocolate mess is to make sure that you stir constantly with a whisk unlike chocolate it doesn't melt as quickly because there's other things going on in there so just using a whisk keep stirring this until you have a nice smooth mixture okay this is looking really good so I'm going to take it carefully off the heat and transfer over a little bowl of chocolate which is going to melt down while I get on with my rice krispie squares so at this point now your chocolate mixture has come together it's melted down completely and if you have a few lumps and bumps it's not the end of the world just keep whisking and you should have a nice smooth mixture so set this aside we have some rice krispies or some crisped corn cereal or whatever you can get your hands on you just want that lovely crunch this can be made with a whole host of different cereals but I think this works the best so we're gonna take that chocolatey melty mixture and pour it straight on in there oh baby looks good the great thing about those Mars bars or the Milky Way bars is that caramel touch because it just adds this lovely chewy velvety texture into these lovely rice krispies treats so using a wooden spoon give this a good mix through and you just want an even coating on all those rice krispies I feel this doesn't even warrant a recipe but you know what this is ultimate satisfaction and these were one of the first things I ever learned to make in the kitchen as a kid so you've got to try them once you have them evenly coated just like I have now we're going to grab up a baking tin lined with some parchment paper and you do need to line it with parchment paper otherwise they could be tricky to get out and then tumble that rice krispies mixture straight on in there it is proper wooden spoon and Bowl sort of cooking I love the fact that everything just gets mixed and melted and everything looks good so just using the back of that spoon we're going to push this down and you're looking for a nice flat even surface over the top because that's where our Chuck is going to go when I was a kid making these my favorite thing to do was take some the heart chakra G rice krispies mixture but I'm not going to do it right now I'm going to save myself okay this is looking pretty good so once this chocolate is melted we're going to pour that straight over the top leave it to set chop it up the chocolate I'm using here is milk chocolate you can use dark chocolate if you want to but I think if you're going to go all out sweet you've got to use milk chocolate so I'm just melting this down and the best thing with milk chocolate is to melt it low and slow because it doesn't have as much cocoa sod so it tends to go a little bit grainy if you heat it up too quickly so just take your time with this and once you have an ice melted mixture it's good to go ladies and gentlemen we are in chocolaty business so I need to now spread this edge over the top of these rice krispies treats so just spread it all the way look at char curly goodness this is where if you want to lick the screen you are totally free to do stuff please do now we're going to spread this very evenly over the top here and you just want a nice even coating just to finish these rice krispies treats and they look so good and now this is going to rest in a cool dark place just until it's firmed up and everything has gone nice and solid and then it's time to slice it up and taste it once these chocolate caramel rice krispies treats have set and cooled and solidified it's time to take them out of their little tin they look pretty good so all I've got to do now is slice it up into nice delicate little squares it's all about the crunch as you slice through these this has to be one of the ultimate simple things to make in the kitchen it is ultimate satisfaction but it gives you exactly what you need that chuckles you caramely hit and the best part is that it's nice and crunchy - that is so good you have to make these they are so delicious they're caramely they're crunchy they're chocolatey basically everything you want from something you can dump and stir and then leave to cool it is really worthwhile making so if you want the recipe you can find it in the box below make sure to like this recipe share this video of course subscribe to the channel for lots more delicious recipes

chocolate rice krispies treats the first thing we need is 2 tablespoons of butter add that to the pan turn your heat to medium then you're going to add 5 ounces of marshmallows next we have to bring the chocolate we need 2 heaping tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder stir that up until it melts it's almost completely melted you can still see a little marshmallow but I want you to turn off the heat before we add the chocolate cuz I don't want the chocolate to burn we are adding a heaping 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips everything is all melted together nice and smooth so I'm gonna take it off the heat just stir in the rice krispies this is 2 and 1/2 cups and just stir it takes a little bit of muscle but you can do it it's worth it ok now scrape it into the prepared pan that's it flat like that and then put a little sprinkle of coarse sea salt on top just for a little crunch and to balance out that sweet chocolate I'm gonna cut these in half but this looks a little much for two maybe we'll do four pieces I love making these for Camille they're the little special treat in her lunchbox that she's going to love you can find the full recipe at dessert for two calm [Music]", "VL6ySKYrmrQ": "welcome to cooking with Buffy today we are going to make chocolate marshmallow treats today our ingredients are butter three cups of cereal you can use any type of half a bag of

pan so let's wait for it to melt and we'll put the March let's mix it together we want it to look gooey um and not a marshmallow shape so it's adding up the cereal and now again so then you have it

Krispies snack bar with like a layer of milk on the bottom they come individually wrapped and you get six so if you were to have one every weekday you would have one left over at the end there we go for the rice krispies with this milky whatever white properly stuff solidified milk on the bottom here we go I think I prefer these two there Coco Pops ones again the solidified milky stuff blends into the rest of the bath quite nicely it's not too bad the textures really nice crispy slightly chewy from whatever they used to hold together the cereal and yeah the Rice Krispies themselves are sweet because of this stuff that ulting together um and they don't taste superb Rice Krispies but there is slight rice krispies taste yeah Olin oil is pretty good not too bad I'd get a very very very

"7Xfbfzqmzxo": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we have a square pan but any other kind of pen works we have some melted butter and then we have our equipment make sure whenever you are using knives have an adult with you okay so the first thing I'm going to do is we're gonna get our pan nice and hot make sure you have a deep pan we're gonna put in some cut butter and we're going to let it melt okay I'm gonna rub it all the way around make sure we cook the sides okay that way the marshmallow doesn't stick when we put it in here to mouth just a little bit more just to be on the safe side that way our marshmallows are nice and toasty and melty well that is nothing on the stove we're going to go ahead and take our pan we have some melted butter right here and we are just going to get our pan all nice and ready we do this so that the marshmallow and the cereal does not stick on the pan when we put it in and that way it's just easy to take it out of the fridge when we're done with it make sure you cook both sides [Music] and that is done we're going to set this off to the side until we are ready next we're gonna go ahead and grab our bowl real quick and we're gonna measure out our marshmallows thanks go ahead and pour those in there if you like a lot of marshmallows and we're going to do the same thing that looks to be about not bowl next we're going to go ahead and dump our marshmallows into our melted butter okay make sure you use a spatula for this one okay everything else gets stuck to this pool so just go ahead and mix it around make sure if you try to get as much butter on all the marshmallows hmm make sure you keep an eye on this or have an adult help you after a few minutes the marshmallows should start mixing together and it becomes this nice creamy you know off the white looking color because of the butter becomes nice and rich okay so we're going to let this melt for a few more seconds and then we're gonna come over here and measure out our fruit loops [Music] a good ratio throw this into our pot mix it up or wick and put it into our pan okay now that our marshmallows all melted and we have our fruits all measured out we're going to go ahead and toss them in mix them up and get them in our pan so aesthetically pleasing it's gonna get a little messy but I promise it is so worth it [Music] and one just kind of all nice and mixed we're going to go ahead and put it over there in the pan so now we're going to go ahead and put our cereal bars in the pan okay make sure you get as much of that marshmallow out as you can go once it is in the pan we're going to go ahead and level it off okay we're gonna flatten and we're gonna make sure it's to the pan go out as much as you can that does not have to be perfect okay and there you have the marshmallow about ten minutes and then we're going to come back and cut them so now that they have chilled are super large move on and take it out cut it up and give it a try okay go oh my

today I'm going to teach you how to make these super cute marshmallow candy corn treats we're going to take our large sauce pan and melt the butter in there that way the marshmallows do not stick to the pan so when the marshmallows no longer have this nice solid marshmallow shape and they start to really blend in into one solid goo pour the melted marshmallows into our mixing bowl and add the food coloring first once the marshmallows are dyed the color we want we're going to add in our rice cereal we will now take the died cereal treats from the bowl and put them into the circular pan you will then repeat this process for the next color once your treats are cool we're going to cut them into a pizza shape since this container is already circular it's going to make a really nice candy corn shape thanks so much for joining me today I hope you had a fabulous time learning how to make these super cute marshmallow treats please connect with us on our social media if you would like to

Welcome to another Nerdy\nNummies! Today, I got so many emails saying that they\nloved the easy mode Lego cake, so I wanted to make something else\nthat was easy mode. And I got so many requests to do something\nfrom Minecraft, specifically, a Creeper! So today, we are gonna be making\nMint Chocolate Chip Creeper Rice Krispy Treats! They\u2019re super easy,\nthey only take like 10 minutes. And here are the things you will need: Kelloggs\nRice Krispies cereal, you\u2019ll need 5 cups of this cereal, baking spray,\n3 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 a teaspoon of peppermint extract, green\nfood coloring dye, a square cookie cutter, this is 2-1/2 inches by 2-1/2\ninches. 1 bag of mini marshmallows, it\u2019s a 10 ounce bag, and some\nchocolate candy melts. I\u2019m using the color black, but if you can\u2019t\nfind colored melts in the color black, you can just melt regular chocolate.\nLike Hershey chocolates or those little kiss chocolates, just any\nmeltable chocolates. Last but not least, 1 big rectangle baking\npan. This is 13 by 9 inches. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna do is take\nyour baking spray, and spray the pan. Ooop! It would be nice if it was pointed\nthe right direction! Now we\u2019re gonna take all of our ingredients\nand head over to the stove, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re gonna put everything\ntogether! I just found a medium pot, put it on the stove,\nand I turned my burner to low. And the first thing you\u2019re gonna do is add\n3 tablespoons of butter. It\u2019s actually not a lot of butter, 1 of\nthose big sticks is only 8 ounces, so this is a little 3 ounce. And you\u2019re gonna put it in the pot, we are\ngonna let the butter melt completely to a low heat, it should only take\nabout a minute, it doesn\u2019t take too long. Now that our butter is all\nmelted, we are gonna add all of the marshmallows! I\u2019m just gonna cut\nthis open, meep-meep-meep-meep-meep! And dump \u2018em in! Once you dump the marshmallows in, we\u2019re\njust gonna stir them until it all becomes like, liquid and gooey. Yum-yum-yum! The marshmallows melt pretty quickly on the\nheat, so this should only take about a minute, it\u2019s really easy. Once the marshmallows are all melted, we are\ngoing to remove it from the heat, put it onto a different burner, and then you\u2019re\ngoing to add your peppermint extract and a little bit of green food coloring\ndye. Now we\u2019re gonna add our 5 cups of Rice Krispies! Now you\u2019re gonna mix it all together, and\njust be sure to stir really gently! After you\u2019ve mixed in all the Rice Krispies\ntreats, we are gonna put it in the pan, it\u2019s really really sticky! Woo! There we go! And now what you\u2019re gonna do is take a piece\nof wax paper, put it on top, and press down. So that it fills to the size\nof the pan. Now that we got our Rice Krispy treats all\ndone, we\u2019re gonna put them in the fridge and let them chill for about 30\nminutes. While our Rice Krispies are cooling off in\nthe fridge, we are gonna make our chocolate creeper faces! The first thing that you\u2019re gonna do, is\nI printed out 6 little Creeper faces, These are about 2-1/2 inches by 2-1/2 inches,\njust like our square cookie cutter. but you can do them any size that\nyou want to do. And I\u2019m just gonna stick them down on top\nof this white cardboard and tape them down with a little bit of scotch tape. At the top, at the bottom! And now, you\u2019re\ngonna take a piece of wax paper, put it right on top, and tape it down. Just\nmake sure it\u2019s really flat\u2026 There we go. Now they\u2019re all ready to put chocolate on\ntop of. In this plastic bag I have melted black candy\nmelts, and this is a number 2 tip, and we\u2019re just gonna trace out the\nlittle eyeballs and the face. Once you have your basic shape, you can also\nuse a little toothpick, like this, and kind of jiggle it around, just\nto make the chocolate a little smoother. When your chocolate Creeper faces are all\ndone, you\u2019re just gonna set them aside and let them cool, because the chocolates\nstill a little bit hot. I just took the Rice Krispies out of the fridge\nand I flopped them onto this flat surface. And what we\u2019re gonna\ndo is you\u2019re gonna take your square 2-1/2 inch by 2-1/2 inch cookie\ncutter, and just cut out all the shapes! If you don\u2019t have the cookie cutter, don\u2019t\nworry, you can just take a sharp cutting knife and just cut the squares by\neyeballing it. Line it up, push it down\u2026 Ow! Geez, maybe\nI need some muscles here! Ta-da! Our first Creeper! You\u2019re just gonna\npop it out and continue to cut the squares throughout the whole thing! Now that we\u2019ve got all of our Rice Krispies\ncut out into little squares, like so. We are gonna take the chocolate Creeper\nfaces and put \u2018em on top. I\u2019ve cut out 1 of the little faces. I just\nlike to do it this way because it\u2019s a little bit easier, and chocolates\nreally easy to work with. You just peel it off and place it on top of\nyour Rice Krispy wherever you\u2019d like. Just kind of eyeballing it. Aw! Look at our little Creeper! He\u2019s so cute! Now we\u2019re gonna do this to the rest of our\nRice Krispy Treatssssssssssssss. See, because that was the Creeper Noise! Ta-da! Here are the Mint Chocolate Chip Creeper\nRice Krispy Treats! They look so cute! They look just like Creepers\nssssshould! I hope you guys liked \u2018em these were so\neasy to make. They only take about 10 minutes to bake, and then an additional\n10 minutes to do the little chocolate faces. So, thanks for suggesting\nit. And if you have any ideas for any Nerdy Nummies,\nplease let me know, leave me a comment down below and I will do\nmy best to make it happen!

"uTPFQf-Nhv4": "I hope everybody's Monday is going great today I've got one of my favorites just a classic treat we're gonna make some rice krispies rice krispies treats and we're gonna coat them with chocolate super super simple recipe you got butter sprinkles just for the top you got your pack of marshmallows preferably mini ones melt a little easier you got your boxer rice krispies great cereal great three great snack gotta love them and then finally to make our coated coat on the top we're going to use semi-sweet chocolate chips super excited to share this one with you guys let's get cooking everyone our first step for this one is super simple just gotta grab your butter and you've got them toss it in your pot get it all melted down and then you're gonna throw your marshmallows in there and start melting them down to put their butter melted most of the way down it's time to crack open the marshmallows and throw me [Music] would your marshmallows now looking like marshmallow soup it's time to take it off the heat and throw your rice krispies into this now it's time to pour in your mush your Rice Krispies now before we get to double boiling our chocolate we just gotta throw our marshmallow mixture into this pan with our rice krispies treats setting off to the side ready to go we just need to get this double boiler going to melt down our chocolate now all we got is this pup inside the saucepan this ball inside the saucepan and we're just gonna let it heat up melt down and we'll drizzle it over the top if you're wondering why this works using a double boiler makes it so that the temperature stays at a constant just write about the boiling temperature of water and that way you don't ever burn your chocolate [Music] all that's left to do is give it a taste test I mean these things look great have it miss Lucas this is gorgeous I'm excited I'd say that for something so easy the roll word is really high usually tastes great so that's a home run so good again really really simple looks pretty really fun I'm really glad you all join me for this and I'll catch you on the flipside [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "2VHT7bH8z8U": "hey everyone so I decided to make some rice krispies treats for Lee's co-workers and I decided to show you all the recipe and how I do them just so that you can actually make them for the holidays or for family if you're gonna be having them over I hope that you all enjoyed this this is great to take to work or to take to a picnic or simply to make them for yourself and enjoy them so I hope that you all enjoyed this video and find it helpful if you give it a try it you know how it out hey Bubba hey what's up eating a banana yeah say hi everybody so let's get this a how-to recipe going of the rice krispies treat so let's get this started alright everyone so what we need Art's choose the block bags unless you have the professional ones that we will be using to pour the chocolate we also need two bags of ten ounce marshmallows I like using the meanings because they do melt a little bit faster we have eight cups of rice krispies treats we have five tablespoons of butter we have a bowl that marshalene this is where I kind of flatten it out this size works great for me I'm gonna see if I need a bigger one later because if I might because I am making them for these co-workers and then you also need some candy melts I like the Wilton ones I've tried other brands and this one seems to work the best you can get them from Michael's you need a bowl that is a heat proof microwave proof to mount your chocolate you need nonstick spray you need some vanilla and a little bit of sea salt that I like to use so those are the things that you need and you do need a deep pan we're gonna be spraying everything that we're gonna be using including this spoon that we will be using everything with with some nonstick and we will also be spraying this as well our hands and we're gonna be using them just so that the stickiness doesn't get all over you with the marshmallows are not what's so here I'm already melting the butter once all of that is melted then we can move on and add the marshmallows onto this mixture alright so now that that's already pretty much melted I'm going to go ahead and put the ten ounce bag of mini marshmallows onto this mess and what you want to do is you want to just continue to stir and you want to stir until this is completely melted you don't want to stop stirring because you don't want this to stick what I did was I put a little bit of that nonstick spray that I was telling you that I was gonna be using on everything I even nonstick sprayed my spatula here so you wanna go ahead and make sure that everything you will be using like the pans and the bowls you put nonstick on there just so that this doesn't melt so we're gonna go ahead and continue to stir this until it completely melts and continue on I have it on medium heat I'm going to be adding a little bit of vanilla to this quite a bit actually a little bit of salt I already crushed it because it's in these little baguettes so I crush it up and then I put some in there and continue on mixing until this is completely melted now that our mixture is melted we're gonna go ahead and put this into the Rice Krispies cereal now we're gonna pour this into our cereal and pour it in there all of it alright so now just begin melting this and melting it this is the time to add our full marshmallows onto this and that way you have chunky marshmallows in your mix I love this and lead us to so this is how we do it we don't just do you know the mixture and that's it we love the marshmallows inside our rice krispies alright now we're going to pour this on to our containers yeah use a little bit bigger one because I made a bigger portion for these coworkers so I'm going to go ahead and just pour it in this bowl dampen your hands just a little or use a nonstick and begin pressing this on not too hard because then it's not fluffy and it's more I guess you could say stiff and hard so this is warm still so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it in the fridge allow it to cool down for about five or ten minutes and then I'm gonna pull it back out and put some of the candy chocolate candy on top of it and I'll show you all how I do that as soon as this cools down we don't want it a huge melted mess so it's better to apply the chocolate on top when it's already a little pulled down so while our Rice Krispies are cooling down we're going to go ahead and start melting our chocolate and I'm gonna do it in thirty-second increments until it's nice and smooth now that our chocolate is melted just like this we're gonna go ahead and pour it into this Cup with our ziplock bag and we're gonna go ahead and just pour all of it in there that's good enough grab our bag we're gonna work with what we have and this is a really efficient way to have to buy anything extra snip it a little bit just at the bottom very little not a big one cuz then you create a mess and then you're gonna begin applying the chocolate any strands just so it sparingly and not like overwhelming amount of chocolate so just continue on with the white chocolate we're applying more white chocolate than dark chocolate so there is a white chocolate now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put this in the fridge for another ten minutes so that it hardens and then I'm gonna overlap it with the milk chocolate into the exact same method with the melting process I usually melt my chocolate in defrost setting I don't actually put like 30 seconds you're in there I do it defrost and it works out better that way so I'm gonna go ahead and let this chocolate get heartened and we'll move forward using the exact same method we do with the white chocolate I'm gonna go ahead and do the milk chocolate but I'm doing this one sparingly so it's not gonna be as much as a white chocolate a quick tip for those of you that want to do them for the holidays is using the white chocolate and using food coloring to to make it look green and red all right so just like that we're gonna go ahead and put this in the fridge as well and let it harden and then we're gonna go ahead and start cutting it all right so now that this is already a semi frozen I don't want to freeze it I just want this to harden but not a lot because then you can easily break the chocolate so now I'm going to go ahead and cut it and you can do it whichever way you like I'm gonna make them a kind of like a medium sized because I don't want them too big because you know there's a lot of co-workers we have so I want to make sure everybody at least gets a taste so maybe about two and a half inches wide", "fNrznwc5WYs": "hi everyone and welcome back to my channel i'm salem raine and today we're making s'mores rice krispie treats let's get started here i have a 9x13 pan that i have lightly buttered you don't have to lightly butter your pan i just like the extra butter and i find that the bars lift out much easier than not having the butter do what works best for you in this large bowl i have four cups of rice krispies or rice puffs i'm going to add one and a half cups of crayon crackers that i crushed up by hand you can see that the pieces are small but not a fine powder and not too large here i have one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips mix it all together let's go over to the stove and melt our marshmallows in a pot i have five cups of mini marshmallows i'm going to turn the stove on to medium heat add a half of a cup of butter you can use salted or unsalted i always use salted because i like the extra flavor i'm also going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract stir this together until it melts and combines it's combined take it off the heat dump in your melted marshmallow and butter mixture to the dry mix mix it up [Music] it's almost combined it's beautifully [Music] combined i like to wear gloves and transfer the booby gooey mixture into your prepared pan or unprepared pan evenly pat it down [Music] beautiful let's go back to the stove and make the marshmallow fluff topping in a pot i have two cups of mini marshmallows i'm going to add two and a half teaspoons of corn syrup i'm using the lily white corn syrup stir this until it melts and combines making a beautiful marshmallow fluff the marshmallows have melted smear the marshmallow fluff on top [Music] cover and refrigerate for about two hours this will help cool them down enough and make it easier to cut into squares you cut them into 24 squares but i like larger squares so i'm only going to get 12 bars or you can do eight i simply cut the pan of s'mores rice krispies into the size that i wanted and place a piece of chocolate bar that i broke up into pieces right on top i hope you enjoy this super simple recipe see you again next time", "LX_VHvjunFM": "so today we're gonna be making rice krispies cakes so here's some of

thank you guys for coming um give a like and we'll see you next week bye bye Anna I don't care", "Z9Yfyau3N-4": "[Music] you know that the colors that you choose I chose blue would like to make it a really light color baby shower at every point you're gonna get a little bit of coconut oil anymore and you're gonna make so once you get this consistency this is what you want and if the color that you want then you just start making as you please I'm gonna first do the covered rice krispies treats and put the sticks on them first okay so I'm gonna unpackage them and then put the sticks on it so what you're gonna do is you're gonna get your rice krispies treats you can make them where you can store by their magical ease you're gonna get your stick dip it in your chocolate or candy and then whatever side you want to go in you're going to insert and then you're just gonna leave it there and you're gonna do the same process over and over again until you get it all done and use as many as you're gonna do as you can see they're all done they're studying waiting you're gonna let them sit so that the kinda gets hard before you start dipping you want to make sure you don't burn your chocolate so you just mix it so it doesn't get stuck to the sides or starts drying out with this lovely thing it won't happen but if you're using my a double boiler or the microwave you want to make sure you're fast on this so again I'm letting the chocolate set so when you pick it up it doesn't fall or anything and this one's still not set yet so you're just gonna wait until it sets I would say like 10 15 minutes or throw it in the freezer for a minute or two and it should be good so as I wait for the the rice krispies treats to get ready I'm going to use these rods which are pretzels to me perfect sticks to the quarters the rugs and I'm going to dip them in the chocolate but you can actually dip them because you got it it's too long so you'll see so the best way to do this is with the long cook that's not too white so you can add in your candy or chocolate or whatever you use because mine others you can see I'm gonna have to pour it on which either way it still works out fine so after you do that you want to tap off the axis you can always double dip it so it can get thicker but I'm not trying to go with the big way stuff got put it should look at again take off the access that'd be a working piece I need to place it on your wax paper and you go for the rest [Applause] [Music] okay so as these are setting and if you're gonna want sprinkles on them you are going to want to put them in the sprinkles beforehand so I'm going with the silvertone because it is gonna be elephant theme some kind of gold fine grades and stuff so but as you can see this will be the after finish wait for the pretzels to set in the fridge or freezer we're going to go ahead and do the Rice Krispies so depending on how you want to do if you want to cover the whole thing or just part of it you can just dip and go as a to far as you want and then pull out top the axis you see the rest fall enough you want to do it gently so it doesn't make this mess it up so that should see good and then if you want to add sprinkles to it again I'm using this silver tone like this for these you just put your hand or your spoon or fork whatever that work spoon whatever you choose to use don't honor what make sure you do it when it's wet you can wait for it to dry a little bit so it sets better but you want to make sure you do it when it's kind of wet so it stays on there because you put it when it's dry they won't grab and then afterwards you're gonna place it on your paper this and you just let it sit I want mine to be standing so I just thought in mind that you want yours to sit you can sit it down okay so now I'm going to go ahead and do the drizzle I'm gonna get my measuring cup with my white [Applause] drop it in there and sit in the microwave for a couple minutes if I can ever get them out I only need a little bit so a little bit goes a long ways so sooner get smelted you can put a little you can put a little bit of coconut oil so you can drizzle with a spoon or you can get a baggie I prefer fast and easy it is what it is so you get a little bit and you drizzle yes it's gonna be messy or you can again get a bag in and drizzle so you just drizzle as you please and then I am going to put a little bit of white and then stop and then I'm going to add the black candy if you can see I'm holding it with the napkin because it's hot so you just gonna a couple strips of black for it to be a great color because I'm trying to go with the silver or the gray and the blue for the baby shower since this elephant so I add a couple of in there and you're gonna mix it's already hot so it will start melting and I already put very very little coconut oil because a little bit goes a long ways if you add too much it won't harden you have the right amount el jard\u00edn and you want it to harden so you just keep mixing you know it's turning colors already that's what you want to go with and say for some reason it's too dark you added too much black you just add more white its own to the color that I want so we're good so this is the color that I'm going for I still have shumsa black in there there's supposed to be like the elephant all right so now it is the color that I want and it's all Mountain see my daughter just hit me in the face and she's laughing might as well you guys are here buggin all right so here's the consistency that I want and I'm gonna put them all throughout all of them so I'm just gonna do like I did earlier I'm just gonna drizzle um you can do whatever you want you can use the baggie it makes it look prettier but I again if I get to look narrow down together all right so that's how to look if you want to go a little more into detail you have your your drizzle and then you can just put color on it like that where you can do a silver sorry I'm covering but you'll see in a minute and it's only gonna grab it where's the fresh white chocolate homie is black no it's a duck okay you don't have to do them all that way you can go any way you want I'm gonna go because again it is a baby boy and I'm trying to go all blue themed okay so that is gonna sit you're gonna let it sit for as long as it gets hard so you want to touch the outskirts to see if it's dry or not so I'm done with this part and I'm gonna go ahead and do my Rice Krispies I need to get another trade a lamb on second drizzle so I'm gonna go ahead and do the rice krispies they're not all the way set which is okay I'm gonna go ahead and just grab each one before the chocolate melts and drizzle I'm not gonna do Y on these I'm just gonna do the chocolate just like that on one end I would lay it down but I kind of want to stay I'm gonna lay them down like this and then you just grab your [Music] and risen then you keep going from there just like that you do as many as you want I stopped kind of dumping I want to do too many because I prefer the ones with sprinkle but so you just grab your rice krispies and drizzle how you please you can use any colors you want just try to buy them our candies or you can just use the regular white chocolate and add coloring to it [Music] and I wanna do with the Susan I already have a couple of sprinkles and you just place them anywhere that doesn't have any of the just like that and the ones that you want with sprinkles again [Music] and they'll stick the blue chocolate is still kind of wet so it will stick perfectly fine on all of it and then I'm gonna go ahead and do some work [Music] because the noises in the background that's my family here and there's that one and I'll put it right here and then that is it on these as you can see I'm done with all of them I do have a mess but it's okay because my kids can clean it up the joys of having kids so I have the rice krispies tips dipped rate dipped drizzle all right as you can see I'm done with all of them I have sprinkles I'm drizzled on the rice krispies treats and then on the other end I have a pretzel sticks or vadas you can say or you want to say they are a regular fizzle that's pencil drizzle and then on this side these are just pickles dipped in simple so if you have any questions please comment below please like and subscribe

and they come in the froot loop and frosted flake variety recently michelle you showed me a little bracket of sorts where people were voting on their favorite cereals and what was what was the result of that was it like honey nut cheerios one it i think it was like honey bunches of oats was the overall winner oh okay and then i think it was up against captain crunch but honey nut cheerios was definitely in in the final four and i can't remember the other thing that was in the final four but it was like a big surprise that lucky charms didn't go any farther froot loops may not have even made the list um it made the list but i don't think it moved forward right i think another one that went far was like crunch berry captain crunch berry but i think frosted flakes was the other thing that was in um the top four all that being said we have here some cereal bars not the actual cereal so anybody who is of our age will remember the cereal bars that came out in the past and i can't remember what the flavors were i think it was captain crunch and i think um the honey nut cheerios and i don't i can't remember if like lucky charms was one of the og's too that remind i think you might be right on that but you know we'd have to go back and do research anyway kellogg's has come out with some new cereal bars and i'm guessing that that milk layer is going to taste very similar to how i remember it before which is kind of like a frosting that's the best way to describe it not exactly a frosting but kind of a frosting um so yeah should we just pop these open and give them a try sure there is no box top on these big disappointment okay let's go with the froot loops first okay i am kind of surprised on the color of the froot loops that they chose and they're usually like a blue yeah where the heck is kind of green right yeah they have those colors and i think i think everything except for blue has been represented so here is what they look like they are very small as you can see but i'm sure they are still sugar filled i wonder if they're smaller than when we had them yeah i remember something much bigger so i now you might remember better than me i used to think that it was in the middle um i i think i remember it being on the bottom but it was definitely like one layer this looks like they just kind of like quickly dipped it and that was it yeah because you can kind of see gaps on the bottom of this too now it definitely smells like froot loops oh yeah so let's see how this tastes this does not remind me of that layer before but i might be going crazy so let's just try it and see all right so let's rate our fruit loop one in three in two in one and rate oh oops oh that's okay so we oh i'm having fruit loop withdrawal we both are going indifferent on this and my reason well michelle why don't you give us your reason first um yeah i kind of had high hopes for this because i really do like fruit loops but they're kind of soggy all it tastes like to me is froot loops i do not think that that bottom thing added anything and like michelle said it's not really crispy like froot loops so um it's also kind of messy so as we've done some stuff before where we could say well on the go this would probably work on the go you're probably gonna have sticky fingers unless you just eat it out of like the packaging yeah sticky fingers and crumbs everywhere right yeah so i i have to go in different it does taste like fruit loops but it's not something you have to go out and try if you've had fruit loops you know what this tastes like again that bottom layer it's basically just there to try to hold the bar together and it doesn't even do a great job yeah and like i said i feel like the ones before like it was like a solid layer of that not just like a quick dip and like yeah okay yeah agreed like yeah i remember that too like it was actually a thing like you know it wasn't like they just had a liquid that was sitting there and like the machine dips and then the next one comes in yeah it was like they laid it on and yeah it formed to the bar exactly all right well let's go ahead and try these frosted flake ones we'll see if this tastes any different like this one's even smaller okay so this the bottom of this one looks a little bit more of what i remember um they've packed it on a bit more here yeah no where the last one smelled just like froot loops this one smells like nothing very odd maybe frosted flakes don't have a distinctive smell though i don't thought they did but yeah we ready to rake these frosted flakes cereal bars this is a tricky one i think in three in two in one rate i'm kind of middle almost up okay i'm going thumbs down because what it reminds me of is a like rice krispie treat but i think rice krispie treats are better so for that we don't even like rice krispie treats i do not so for that reason that's why i'm kind of giving it a thumbs down the first few bites of it were very strange and then and maybe that was because i just ate the froot loop one but then i was able to get a bit more of like that frosted flake taste but again that bottom layer is not really doing anything except holding it together and probably just adding the sweetness and the calorie count up which i know doesn't really matter for this channel we don't care about that but if it's not adding anything to me then i don't really see the point of it so i'm gonna go thumbs down for that reason so i was actually a little bit different because this one compared to the froot loops one reminded me more of the ones we had back in the day um but i'll have to agree like the first bite or two it was kind of like almost no taste and then the more you ate it like i really got that frosted flake flavor um yeah cause like right now i'm i'm getting a frosted flake like aftertaste and it's very distinct but it was weird it was a weird first couple bites your brain was trying to process what this is is this a rice krispie treat like what am i eating so yeah i mean maybe because i do like rice krispie treats that's why i'm more on the positive side but yeah i like this one better than the fruit loops one i have to say and there you have it our take on the new cereal bars maybe they'll come out with those old ones again i'd love to see those old lucky child's ones i know lucky charms is out actually oh okay so i don't know if you want me to go pick those up yeah pick those up let's grab them all let's bring in the lucky charms and see what we think we'll have our own bracket yeah our own bracket of cereal just between us because if anyone really cares yeah we got that's going to be the next big improvement to the studio is a big old white board that can be the bracket so anyway look forward to that peace bye", "QFvIkFZFjDw": "[Music] hi guys and welcome to another home law it's me Sean star back in my kitchen so yes you guessed it today I want me to make in michie shape rice krispie treats here are my ingredients this is so exciting I'm actually going to be using a recipe from Baker girl she's on YouTube really cool yeah I'm using her recipe today what you'll need for this is 6 cups of rice krispies treats cereal treats Rice Krispies cereal you'll need 10 ounces of marshmallows the Jumbo ones are harder to melt so make sure to get the smaller ones and three tablespoons of butter now I also have semi-sweet baking chips because I will be putting chocolate on after so this is this you don't really need but I want to decorate and also some mini M&Ms just because I want to and also for this you'll need a pot to to plod back there and pan of this sort this is where the treats will go but stay tuned and watch as I do it so first things first three tablespoons of butter people use stick butters but I'm using the Smart Balance so three tablespoons higher this is a tablespoon three of those and all right ice cream almost three it's not ice cream don't it's not cool now you want to put it on a very low heat so here I go working I'm putting on a really low heat so I don't know it's like low to four I put it on four do you see how the heat is all right now now that we have some butter in there what I do is grab this spoon you mix it all over I wanna see what's looking to the yeah PC is the light there you go so just make sure that goes all around so nothing sticks to the bottom and let your butter melt thoroughly before adding anything else all right so now that that butter is all nice and melty you're gonna put all your marshmallows in and like I said before I recommend using the smaller ones because the bigger ones take longer to melt all right now you just want to stir it all with the butter so keep on stirring so the the annoying part of this is because it's on such a low heat you're gonna be stirring for such a long time until it's melted also people recommend putting in half the marshmallows on the other half but do it however you want you so let's serve it so as you see this takes a while but I really don't encourage you to raise the temperature on the stove because it will burn and you need it really fluffy so it's still taking some time but what I've noticed is the smaller marshmallows are melting faster I've only used the Jumbo ones and they take forever so this actually is going pretty well so these are my Rice Krispies is not mold this is apparently the springtime rice krispie treats so just letting you guys know that's why it is green and blue all right so now you see how melty that looks now so what it looks like that we're gonna put three cups of the rice krispies treats yeah because if you put all it's not gonna oh here we go you're gonna hold on to the pot and mix and get it all in there oh yeah it's gonna stick to the side so make sure you get fat to the sides and make sure it gets all marshmallowy so keep circles side fYI this is a very sticky dish so you'll see how I'll be using butter coming up to see also that's a great arm workout like if you know the gyms are closed you know florentine I do this you will get to this arm workout but remember to rotate I am so good at this I stick to one side now we're going to put in there as you can see rest in peace fallen soldier keep it going keep my hands right so yeah red they are okay so this parchment paper is nonstick but I don't trust anything so what I do is take my hands are all clean I think some of the butter before and we're just gonna spread it along the bottom better see you guys do it like I like to use my fingers like I said I my hands are clean and just spread it spread it on the bottom because you definitely want here are rice krispie treats not to spit another tip is when you're done doing this you can also and I suggest buttering up your cookie cutter now sometimes it will stick the rice krispies mix will stick to this so butter this up as well all right let me do this better now so yeah we are putting the mixture onto the pan oh my god looks so good our pan might eat too big if it's not we're going to spread out to the corners once that it will be hot so I'm careful so because I have the butter on my hand it's good because it's not gonna stick to my hands cuz this is super sticky and hot so if I were you to butter up those hands so yeah make sure your hands are kind of buttery this is what I do and then use it and spread it up into the pan so it's not sticking to my hands we're going to swish it out into the corners now it's sticking to my hands as I said it's not and what you can also do is I get a spoon to I kind of smoosh it out because it's or you can also butter up a spoon and like spread it out like that so it's seesaw sticking to the spoon and spread it out I'll try to eat people say you spread out into the corners but if you feel it's gonna be too thin you don't have to people like their rice krispies thicker some like them thinner I like them anyhow I don't care how your rice krispies I like the races so I'm patting it down and if you want to pull in the edges on some parts be my guest be our guest be our guest be our guest now I've been missing Disney you know so I usually buy this at Goofy's candy company why I got a Goofy's candy company when you could do it in your own house now what we do once I wash my hands we're gonna let this cool what you can do is leave it out for it to harden or put it in the fridge for a 10 to 20 minutes I like to put it in the fridge or freezer 10 to 20 minutes to make sure it gets hard so check you guys back in about 20 minutes so just took it out of the freezer we put it in for 10 minutes and it's pretty hard like it's not gonna break apart so now we are melting the chocolate also off-camera i greased up the cookie cutter so it's easier to now if you don't want to do mickey shape rice krispies treats you can also do square ones or whatever you want to do any cookie cutter you have you do I'm doing Mickey shirt look at this cute couple aren't they so cute so I didn't use the entire back of the semi-sweet chocolate just half because I'm not going to put chocolate on every treat so I just kind of mix it a bit gonna mix it a little more looks like cake frosting yeah look at that chocolate its semi-sweet because that's already so sweet you don't want to over bear it okay so this is time truth see if ten minutes in the freezer worked so I'm going to try to cut my first one let's do it here start on the outer edge so you can use as much of the treat here we go and just forcefully hear that alright guys ready [Music] [Music] oh my goodness it's so cute all right okay I'm gonna do a bunch more and also since the sides are gonna be like that if you just want to make them in squares or your own fun shapes go ahead and do that [Music] Mickey Wright's making shape or who rice krispies treats so this is totally optional because I'm just been eating myself extra it's delicious but this is where you can add your chocolate and M&Ms or sprinkles so people dip them in I don't want to so what I do is I'll just take this one and if there's so little soft so I think maybe we would put this back in to freeze a little bit more so the ten minutes I think you could leave it for maybe fifteen or twenty so yeah on some of the treats I'm just going to layer some chocolate on the ears so this is obviously but I need to dry so hard and I should say so if you want just on the ears or maybe you know what let's drag it out it's already a lot let's drag it across okay now what I'm just gonna so while this is still kind of like what go ahead and put your Eminem song there get creative oh my gosh so only guy do these do that with a few of that because I don't want chocolate on all but you can do whatever you want if you want to put the whole thing in chocolate be my guest and look at here you have all this remaining you can cut into squares you can eat it just to be like a taste test I'm gonna like absolutely delicious oh my goodness my name and there you have it that's how I do my Mickey shape rice krispies treats thank you guys for watching and here's one final pick of how they look right here yummy thank you guys for watching and as usual do you boo and live your life", "7KO9I2jgXM8": "[Music] hello and welcome to cooking with josh already in progress today we're making rice crispy squares or today we're

temperature or you can cool it inside your fridge [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "yfeDs_q820g": "hey guys welcome to another video um for today's snack review yes i have another snack review for you today uh we're gonna be trying the new crave chocolate chip cookie dough cereal um i'm normally not a huge cereal person anymore um you know i like you know like fruity pebbles candy bar and things that are like cereal themed like that or things that maybe i grew up on when i was a kid and things like that um but this one really caught my eye there isn't you know besides like cookie crisp and besides like some other obvious ones there really isn't a lot of like chocolate chip cookie dough themed cereals so this one kind of caught my eye a little bit more another thing that was kind of interesting too is there's like some type of a chocolate filling inside of each piece of the cereal so i thought that was kind of interesting almost kind of like a pop-tart kind of a twist on cereal and they even made pop tart cereal i think at one point so hopefully this is kind of along the line of that but yeah this one really caught my eye the crave chocolate chip cookie dough cereal it is special edition so i don't know how long it's going to be around so that was another reason for me to want to get out there and try it so um let's give this a try today i have the bag of cereal separate from the box just because this box for whatever reason didn't want to close properly for me so i have those two things separate for this review so that was just to kind of get you to see what the cereal box looked like in case you come looking for this one in the stores so this is the cereal itself right here let me pour some in my hand and we'll give it a try and as always i'm going to assign a movie to the snack at the end of review like i always do with my snack reviews so just to kind of keep it in the theme of my channel that's what they look like outside of the box let's see if i can tip it right for you they have like little chocolate chip pieces on them and like at the box display there is some type of a chocolate filling inside so let's give these a try and kind of see what they're like i'll probably just put the whole handful in my mouth now that we're talking here really really good they never look up to the name crave for sure you want to crave more and more of them as you eat them this is really good like i said i'm not a huge cereal person i don't go kind of out of my way to find a cereal this one i would probably pick up again though just for snacking purposes this could kind of pass as like a good solid dessert um yeah even with milk it's only um given it's only one cup on the nutrition facts even when you add milk it's only 230 calories so if you like put it in a small cup for like a dessert or something it's really not that bad for you there's quite a bit of whole grain on it too from what the box is suggesting too so i really like this uh let's go nine out of ten on this just because like i said i don't really go out of my way for cereals this one for sure was really good it definitely lives up to kind of the hype of the intrigue of like a chocolate chip cookie dough cereal um i think i do like this better than cookie crisp also while we're at it nine out of ten for me as far as a movie is concerned let's assign a movie to this um one movie i immediately think of just because of cookies and cookies kind of showing up in as a prop in an interesting way probably the house with a clock on its walls because in that movie there's even a line that says um weird is like the nuts in my cookies it's the nuts that make it interesting it's kind of an important theme of that movie so we'll go with the house with a clock on its walls for a snack for the movie assigned to this uh definitely you know the cookie prop and the message of the movie and all that the cookie theme of the cereal um so yeah nine out of ten i really like this one so if you happen to see this at your cereal section at whatever store you might go to i would give this a try i really like this this is the chocolate chip cookie dough crave cereal nine out of ten for me really recommend this one really quite good", "lv__zHrTl8s": "should i come in surprise or you're surprising though hi guys welcome back welcome back to my channel today we have a guest

s'mores um heart shape rice krispie treats and puppy chow and so i already made my rice krispie treats just right now we're letting them sit and while they're sitting we're going to be making the s'mores and so what you'll need for this is golden grahams which taste super good mini rice mini marshmallows and then you don't need to get these ones but since it's valentine's day we got the m m cupid mix and so what you're going to do is you have the ball and then you're just going to take like all of it and then put them all in and so i originally thought so you're going to put it like that but what i originally thought this was was you're gonna like i thought you were making individual ones but then it wasn't that at all it was just like this there we go i finally got them out let me just break these up real quick all right there we go it's all broken up and then we're gonna add in some more mush and we're gonna add in some more m m's gotta pick that um up really quick there we go it's picked up and so my dog is saved and then we're just going to put in some more crayons and so you can make this as big as you want but i think this right now is big enough since we're going to be making a lot more treats and then my hands are washed and then you're just going to mix them in i'm just trying to get them all mixed up and then now it's time to eat so i'm just going to be putting them into this heart-shaped bowl i'm just going to use it with my hands [Music] and then there you go there's your mix so the s'mores are really good um i'm just gonna take a little bite of it so i'm gonna get the graham the marshmallow and the chocolate chip and the chocolate [Music] that's really good they're a very good mixture and so now this is done i'm just going to set this aside and then now we can go into making our rice krispie treats so we set these for about 20 minutes a little more than 20 minutes since i put since i've made them at 11 before and that was 11 29. so you're just gonna be finding your heart shape so i got this size of a heart i feel like that's a good size almost and then i got two other ones just for like if there's extra little pieces since i love many things so i got this mini heart and then we're going to be using these like i said mentioned and then these two so some people might say to like wait a little bit but we waited at least 20 minutes before i did this another card and so let's just cut them now [Music] so they are finally done and they are all cut into heart shapes it took me a really long time so now it it's now to the fun part of decorating them so we have red and pink um icing and then we have a lot of different tips those are all the tips and then i used this to the ones without holes and so the pink one i think is that one right there at the bottom and then the red ones at the top so now it's just going to the decoration [Music] [Music] so [Music] so the rice krispie treats are finally done being decorated and so i have two plates full of them and now it's time to finally make the puppy chow that my family has been begging me to make all day long so let's just get into it so what you'll need for puppy chow is a stick of butter some powdered sugar chex peanut butter and then i'm gonna get these perfect and chocolate chips and so the first thing what you're gonna do is you're gonna get a pan or like a pot and then you're going to melt chocolate chips peanut butter and the stick of butter together so i'm gonna do that really quick so i forgot to mention that you guys need just one cup of peanut butter and then you're going to put you're gonna put the butter in and the chocolate chips and the milk and all at low heat and then until they're melted and once my stuff is melted i will come right back to tell you guys what you're supposed to do next so it's all melted it's a chocolatey color a little bit so that's the color of it and it's all combined and now you're just going to do 8-9 scoops of chex mix so one scoop two scoops three scoops and then i'm just gonna mix those in and so i'm just gonna let you guys know mud buddies are the same thing as um puppy chow and so i don't know if i clarified how much chocolate chips but you're gonna need one cup of chocolate chips and so they're all mixed in and now i'm just gonna finish doing my scoops [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so i put in all of the eight cups and now it is time to mix and so once you guys mix you guys are going to be needing your powdered sugar now and you guys are going to be needing a parchment paper so i'm going to make mine on the table and then you're gonna need a bag to shake it all up [Music] and so it's gonna take a little while to get um the chex mix combined with the chocolate mint [Music] so now my mix is all done and you're just going to be getting a big bag like a big plastic bag and then you're just going to be putting powdered sugar at the bottom of it and then you're going to be putting your mud your mud buddies in there and then you're just going to like layer on top of each other so you can like mix it up put your powdered sugar mud buddies mix it up powdered sugar mud buddies mix it up and on and on [Music] so now that you've moved to your workspace and you need to put down your parchment and so my parchment paper is already down and my bag has been shaken up you are just going to be

and thank you guys so much for watching today's video um please subscribe like comment down below and hit that notification bell so bye [Music] you", "olkovGGkIwg": "today Kevin and I are gonna be trying three different bars from a Clare in Ireland thank you very very much Clare these this is actually from Tesco and she sends us like a whole boxful these these are Tesco healthy living chocolate and caramel cereal bars and then these are both fulfil bars this is a fulfil white chocolate and cookie dough this is peanut and cold so let's say let's do the Tesco healthy living mark bar it is chocolate and caramel big on tanks lower in calories it's only 68 calories for the cereal bar so that's great it's rice and whole wheat flakes it has a caramel dark chocolate oats just trying to read you some of the ingredients I like how they're good enough how I can bowl what kind of main reason so yes I do too so it's just uh looks like something do you get back to the birds cereal bar that was the G did the birds lead out to you immediately get the caramel what that shoe is to keep warm isn't very good it's good though mm-hmm after you get a little bit of flavor of that chocolate on them yes but the mailing what your taste is caramel and it's not a sweet caramel it's more of the bar-parlour particle mm-hmm very good you have to work out it's very dry I think this would be good with something you definitely exempt them to drink cuz I did you think was drown me bro it was dry but it was good and I can see why you like it for six years yeah it was the healthy thing with me these are fulfilled bars these are made in Dublin Ireland so that's pretty cool this is the white chocolate and cookie dough 20 grams of protein 9 vitamins it's low in sugar and you see it is 195 calories for the entire and Kevin and you can see it better what is that one of those bars that we got zero zero but no no well that too does convert quest more that's what that kind of looks like it's a quest bar okay you open it up and it looks like there's a layer I have a chocolate on the bottom and then on the top there's a layer of caramel did that kind of magic last fall what's happen what credo hmm this reminds me player of a typical protein bar over here hmm it has that typical protein bar flight and extra in texture it's not the worst protein wow man I don't care for I've had worse and it's when you swallow it it's kind of creamy and it stays around with you don't have yeah it was kind of a chemical there's a chemically flavor there yeah I'm gonna I have it all my passages phone you know using your ears everywhere huh that's not the worst one I've ever had but definitely this one is the peanut caramel and it was - Oh Bob listen it's way too small for me is $200 I'm really looking forward to this what I love peanuts they're not brainy like the soy protein is for me it doesn't have that sand-filled it's just the greatness of the bar itself it's just the ingredients in that bar is kind of like you know this is called white chocolate and cookie dough but when I open it up there is a clear layer of what looks like caramel yeah yeah that's me yeah definitely caramels out of a lot a dimensional two dimensional cuz they're called white oh yeah white chocolate egg cookie dough because I mean clearly there's a layer of caramel there in this one in the same thing okay hmm I can smell the peanut peanut call mmm different texture mmm soccer Virtue's mm-hmm I like that one a lot matter that one's actually do some mhm it still has that typical protein texture it's not a little bit of that flavor but the peanuts of the chrome mold yes a lot yes I like the flavor of the peanut and I like the flavor of the caramel and I you can to flavor up the chocolate you can taste that that's a lot better for yes and the texture when you swallow it there still is that grating that's that and you're left over with that taste to a little bit but it's a much much better now that one for me yeah so the peanut caramel one it's probably worth trying yeah I would not buy this one again white chocolate a cookie dough and Claire you are gonna have to call them out or anybody else who gets these for Phil bars tell us which one time for their more yeah tell us which one is your favorite have you tried this one and what did you think have you tried the peanut and caramel what did you think of it you liked a lot I think a protein bars all the time you probably like these because they are better than so mm-hm oh yeah definitely but out of those two I would get the peanut caramel out of all free market product right just this one yeah yeah I think I would say I would get although I like that this is 68 calories the test says it was just it was it was very chewy chewy yeah yeah well thank you very much Claire for giving us the opportunity to try something from Ireland that's totally cool I loved it and like I said if you all tried any of these please let us know in the comments and thanks for watching [Music]", "smX5qtLjSw8": "hello welcome back to my channel today we are making fruit look cereal bars the ingredients that we need for this recipe is 6 cups of fruit

fruit loops in them which is great for Valentine's Day also you may want some icing or some sprinkles to decorate the top of these bars [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] see how

make they take no time at all these things take time but they taste so good your family will think you slaved over them all afternoon and that's what they think well what they don't know won't hurt them rice krispies treats honey Oh", "BDZfWps0Ktk": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like you need a weekend from your weekend yes that's how this weekend's been for us not gonna lie I have chronic times today most because they're cancelling the Grand Tour I don't know if you guys watch that show at all but it's this car show that I love to watch I'm sick of hearing Jarrod's words I'm Katy all seriousness you guys I have missed you I've been really busy at work and what kind of life things going on and so I'm have not been on the blog very much which you've noticed but you've been in great hands it has been it has been kind of nice right yeah seriously I actually started making a new intro video that was like so Jared and Britta's Jared and Finn Billy and I were like running in slow motion who thinks you're just still post that I do have five poppy Sunday coffee Sunday it's almost Easter here but the whole Easter everywhere in the world [Laughter] it's almost Easter like he really yeah Easter is almost here saying Poppy's Sunday is because it's Sunday here we are about to watch a movie but sometimes on Sundays I like to make little treats for us cuz I have some time and we were kind of craving rice krispies treats a childhood favorite by the way everyone loves rice cooker trees oh my gosh when I hear rice krispies treats or think of them I thought about hitting on my mom my mom would make these all the time on Sunday you just make big pans so there's seven kids in my family as you guys know we had a big family and rice krispie treats was a staple at our house we would oftentimes get this side the box this was a Britney's portion with you my recipe for rice krispies however it's gonna be a little mixed up today he's put in a little twist these bad boys of extort Easter colors purple pink yellow and blue this could be an oval disaster Britney can't fail in the kitchen unlike me don't say that it could really be a fail you guys they do whatever that's okay the other thing I'm throwing in here you guys is one of our favorite things that comes out of Easter witches Cadbury eggs these little nuggets of goodness but anyways we're gonna start making these and they should be pretty delicious things that was incredibly cheesy first thing you want to do is get a pretty good sized saucepan I'm gonna throw in this is four tablespoons of butter but we actually need six because everything is better with butter around another two and we're just gonna get this melted now I'm gonna unless this guy's help he's gonna help me shut up these unicorn marshmallows we're not gonna show Finley because the sister watched his haircut Jared you give them specifications you want the doctor like I did yeah little puppy an inch off to get 1/2 inch oh hold on one second okay so I went in there and I told her we want him to have a haircut she said how short I said a little bit shorter than usual I didn't realize she was gonna be taking like a buzz cut yeah seriously he has no fur it's definitely t-shirt we still love him to learn little Finn doesn't look like little thing yeah well here's the other thing that I didn't really like about it the lady said it's gonna be two to three hours so I show up three hours later and she hasn't even started yeah so I feel like she Tori rushed it as you can probably see because like there's parts of his head that have like haircuts like what we were expecting but that's okay we got a referral from a friend of ours who we really try send they referred us to this girl that said that's coming up so he'll be going there next I'm gonna use these and just regular mini marshmallows right here these ones you'll see what I'll do with these I'm not gonna put them in the mixture until at the very end so they don't melt and kind of muddy all the colors together I can want them to stay this color and together for chewy texture it's pretty easy to remember with this recipe and six tablespoons of butter the six cups of fresh cream I wish I could share the song with you guys but I can't cuz the copyright purposes but if you guys get a chance definitely check out this song it's called a human by The Killers and it's a remix anyway we've been listen to it all day dancing around check it out you guys good chance which is one of my favorite songs ever this is the part I've never done my idea for this movie just to kind of be little chunks of Marshall [Music] okay look it's kind of working for that love is like that cereal Lucky Charms I'm gonna just spread it out to the pan so I just wet my fingers a little bit you guys and this will help to see it doesn't stick to your hands the trick to good marshmallows is not like shoving it down because then they're gonna be more dense if you like it that way great if you like them a little work chewy airy just don't now here's what I'm thinking we do we take the cutter extend it want them to get all chocolatey and melty everywhere so I thought though we could just kind of stick the eggs just kind of like randomly we had kids we trick and crush it right now yeah awesome parents that you know pink can't eat these but that's okay you still loves us [Music] leave me to cool for about an hour but look how bubbles look I think kids especially would love these during Easter times they can help make them it's you saw how easy it was literally takes about ten minutes to make knows nothing so it looks like the Cadbury eggs have held up as well so wait till they're it's a little cooler to put them on what doesn't melt everywhere and get chocolate but find a little extra treat our tree is done we're ready we're going to go watch a movie tonight that's not our favorite things to do on Sunday night instead of watch a movie Jarrod has been working really hard on an awesome drum we call it a collage yeah it's kind of good drone collage of Hawaii that I thought you guys would really like we had a few people comment saying like oh

one and aluminum foil so let's get started when you want to spray your cooking spray which I have already done and the next thing you want to do is you want to add you serious however much you're making or however much you like and then you want to take your marshmallow and fill up your measuring cup your cup fold you can do us as much as you want but I feel like this is going to be enough so you just want to mix it around and I'm actually going to add more marshmallow and so you just want to mix me around and then you want to put it in the microwave for 36 so you put it in put 37 later it still looks the same but all the marshmallows are melted and so you just want to mix it up to get it like Barry together and to prevent it from sticking you should have put your hand under water like in in water but I don't really care if my hand fitnesses so you just mix it mix you're going to need to get small sections and put them into little bars or middle balls they look cute and put them on your tin foil so they they won't have a place to put that you want to get your top in as i'm using nutella and you just want to take your stick and drizzle it doesn't need to be looking all nice

welcome back to my channel my name is Hank il and if you're new here remember to subscribe turn on the notifications and give this video a like so today we're going to be making Lucky Charms rice krispies treats and these are so good and tastes so amazing but before we do this I wanted to tell you guys in an upcoming video I'm thinking about doing popping someone's Instagram and I have to tell all youtubers do this and I really want to do this but I need like someone to copy so comment down below a celebrity you think I should copy like a cast of a TV show I should copy and please do that give me some ideas thank you so much and enjoy the video first you're gonna take a stick of butter and grease a microwave-safe bowl secondly you're gonna take a bag of craft jet puffed marshmallows mini or jumbo and pour them out into your bowl then you're gonna measure out two tablespoons of butter and also put that into the bowl once you've put all these things into the bowl you're going to take your mixture and put it in the microwave for two minutes with 30 second intervals or mixtures and end up looking like this and then you're gonna mix it until it is one consistency and one color it should end up looking like this next you're gonna pour a whole box of Lucky Charms cereal into the bowl and mix that into and I found this quite hard to mix it with the marshmallow and at first you think you won't have enough marshmallow but in the end it will end up being enough you just kind of have to work at it for a while and it should end up looking like this and you should see there would be like little strings attached cheese's of cereals when you pull it apart and then you're gonna take a tray and pour all of your like cereal treat into the tray and this also is kind of hard because it sticks to each other but maybe you'll need like a friend or something to hold the bowl and that will help then you'll take off the field mixture and in that kind of hard things you're gonna see a sticky sheet but backs papers and just kind of a punch it my mistake was I went out slow until it's one flat layer then you cut it into cubes and for me there's about 15 servings then you can serve it up and my whole family loved this so I hope you guys make it too hi guys hope you enjoyed the video and I just want to tell you guys I lost some of the footage at the end I had like a piece of footage

Kellogg's these are the Special K pastry crisps this is a big caramel latte flavor and I have the rice krispies treats the caramel chocolate chunk we're gonna get some caramel and both of them the rice krispies were a dollar ninety-nine and the special pay worth 259 and they were both bought at Meijer Wow caffeine equal to half a cup of coffee so caramel latte natural flavored with other natural flavors 100 calories per pouch so we have reviewed a lot of these pastry crisps and that's what they really are they are like a thin a pop-tart you can not put these in the toaster though so neat stickers at 50 calories yes  the crisp outside and very strong coffee fire yes no I could though not flavor I had one all the time but it is neat to kind of get that little coffee flavor it's the texture of coffee I mean the texture of komal but you get coffee flavor I think coffee lovers will really appreciate having this flight go from strong for me personally I would go towards fruit flavor I would to person I would much rather have a cherry or an apple berry I would pick those any day over this flavor yeah but it's a new flavor of you but if you love coffee then it's good then it's very good and it's only a hundred calories and you are getting some caffeine in it and there is a there's a sweetness but it's not overly sweet it mainly just tastes like coffee honestly why so he liked coffee drama I'm gonna open this from the top this is not how you're supposed to after the body was still up close but yeah for us it's easier to keep it up in the cabinet if it's like this then just put it from the side some people would try this agreed and so I like the size of these that's that the little thing where you can write your message to your kids when you throw in their lunch bags yeah so these are 80 calories each I think it's really cool that years ago they started making these for Halloween and they're like 40 calories aged so they're half the size and you can give them out for Halloween but these are the caramel chocolate chunk and like I said 80 calories Bart they're made with no high fructose corn syrup they're crispy marshmallow sweaters that's softer than some of the other ones I've happened that's more like you made it at home that's kind of looser yes what is some rice krispies treats are so sharp yeah I almost you hey you'll heart your mouth so how did you hurt your mouth when you get one I think the original flavors are always like that they're very dense it's hard in this this is solved yeah I can actually squeeze that it'll come apart I'm wondering if the caramel softened it up it's there good I like it it's very sweet I don't really get that chocolate necessarily it's almost yeah it's all caramel but I want chocolate on there is that drizzle on top though so the the Special K where it didn't really I know it has sugar in it but it really didn't have sweet it just tasted like coffee this is like full-on sweet so like this is like over the topic you don't like really really syrupy sweet cuz that's what this is this is my gas can fill the sugar got in my teeth sweet but I think it's delicious for me 80 calories is not bad either cuz you're gonna have like five and four five out of nine you can even need two for 160 and still be less than I get a candy bar and feel like you've gotten quite a bit T yeah these are definitely you know they're both Kellogg's products which one would I buy again of these two flavors oh I would definitely go with this one yeah cover more of a sweet person in a car yeah I went sweet but now if that had been like a fruit flavor like cherry or strawberry or something like that but even then it would probably would have been harder to choose because I really do like that thin crisp very nice it's very nice so either one of these it just depends on what kind of a mood you're in what you're wanting you know your kids will probably like these I don't think I would not want to give my kid that because all the caffeine right not that it might amount of caffeine anyway to me but I just I don't want them to get addicted to coffee it's my kids were drinking coffee that young so I hope you enjoy the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "aKwWOv9VBMo": "today I'm making rice krispie squares and here are the ingredients that we need half a teaspoon of vanilla I've got one eighth of a cup of butter you can also use margarine instead I've got thirty marshmallows and I have five cups of rice krispies so those are the ingredients so let's get started all right the first step just get our melted butter in there just get all of our marshmallows in there so we're going to melt these down and then we're going to take it off the heat we're going to add in our vanilla and then we're going to stir in our rice krispies and it's that simple this is a really good treat for kids and adults like it too so we're just going to slowly get these melted and I'll come back when they're a little bit more done check my other videos if you want to see how I made homemade butter very very simple all I use was cream very heavy whipping cream so this is almost done now just going to continue melting this and I'll be back all right we're almost there just a few more seconds on the heat here and this will be completely melted okay that's good enough so at this point I'm going to remove my hot plate and I'm just going to get down my towel here I'll just continue stirring that there we go and I'm going to pour in the vanilla get that mixed in beautiful you can see how easy this is and now what we're going to do is we're just going to get the rice krispies in so I'll just get in few of these about half of them give it a little stir right I'll get the rest of them in there we go and just get it all stirred up if you have a problem you can just get your just get a spatula get in there with a spatula as well go all right I'll continue mixing this and I'll be back now if you want these a little bit gooey or you can add more marshmallows you know another five or six large marshmallows will make this even go where I don't like it that gooey so this is the recipe that I used okay that's pretty good so I've been doing that for a couple of minutes and that's done all right I've got my little cake tin here and I'm simply going to get this all in there this is a nine by nine tin I'm using here so I'll get this in and I'll be back ready just get that off now if your pan is not new this pan is pretty new so this isn't going to stick but if you have a pan that sticks on that sticks a little bit you'll probably want to put a little bit of margarine or butter inside the pan before you put the rice krispies in but you shouldn't really have a problem so now just take your spatula and just push down just like that and there's no baking involved you just have to let these cool all right perfect so that's it for this recipe so what we're going to do is we're just going to let this cool down for a couple hours and then I'll come back and we'll pop them out we'll cut them up into little squares so I'll see you in a bit alrighty so my rice krispie squares have cooled considerably and what I did was I just went around with a spatula and just loosened up the edge like this all the way around and then I had to get underneath and I actually had to lift it up so if you want to use parchment paper or a little bit of butter or margarine it's probably a better thing to do I thought it would come out easier but wasn't bad anyway here we go you can see there's not much mess in there at all alrighty and there is our rice krispie squares and so you can just cut these any which size you want any which way you want it'll just get in there like that just cut them up make sure I'm on camera here there we go and here it's got a nice crisp crunch to it there we go look at that then that look good mmm YUM so I'm going to cut the rest of these up and I'll show you the final product and my little ending video so that's it for now I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time you", "OXMDHHWoKDM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you how to make infused oreos this recipe is so simple so easy and you can make as little as you want you can even just make like one or two and they have more frosting in the end so extra frosting definitely better [Music] here's what you're going to need some oreos i chose double stuff because i like extra frosting infused coconut oil or butter and icing sugar your first step is to take your desired amount of oreos open them up and then separate the cookies from the cream and just put the cream into a bowl then you can add in some melted infused coconut oil or butter and just add that to your oreo cream in the bowl and mix it all together the amount you use is up to you i wouldn't use any more than the same amount of oreo filling that you have because i think it might affect the taste a bit more but you can play around and see what you like best now in order to keep the texture what we're used to in an oreo cookie we're going to need to add some icing sugar so i'm just putting a few spoonfuls in there until i get a nicer thicker consistency if you're having trouble getting it to mix properly just throw it in the microwave for uh 20-ish seconds which is what i did here and then i'm just mixing it all again until it's super smooth and you can taste it and see how you like it you can add more icing sugar more butter more coconut oil more of the original oreo filling it's whatever you feel tastes best now this frosting is ready to either be dipped into or put directly back onto the oreos or just eat it in the bowl um but i'm going to be piping onto my oreos so i'm just putting it into this little piping bag but you could also use a knife or just a spoon and do it directly on there you can see the frosting drips out of my bag a bit because it is too warm so i throw it in the fridge for a little bit so it's a little bit thicker when i'm putting it onto my oreos it's been in the fridge for about 10 minutes and now i am going to pipe the frosting onto each oreo and then you can put the other cookie wafer on top and press them together to be little oreo sandwiches i put them in the fridge for a couple more minutes and then they are ready to eat all right now that they're done let's give them a try [Music] very good you can taste coconut oil a little bit so maybe using butter would have been a little better but they're very good thank you

i'm kelly shalom registered dietitian and personal trainer behind the blog hungry hobby and this channel and i'm here today to show you how to make my homemade protein bars these protein bars are just five ingredients super easy to make super quick perfect for meal prep and no more buying protein bars at the store with a billion chemicals in them so before we get started if you are ready to make this recipe make sure that you subscribe to my channel hit that red subscribe button and the bell notifications i post new delicious healthy recipes with real food every week and even more on the blog and workouts and nutrition tips and all kinds of stuff so you don't want to miss that so make sure that you hit that button now and then we can get started y'all i make this recipe for mr hungary that's known to my vlog readers almost every single week he loves it and he's always hated protein bars okay and i'm always struggling to get him to have enough protein i mean the dude is sick too and super active pre-corn team played basketball all the time but now we work out in our house all the time very active lifts and basketball and you know tall to start with and just not get enough protein and i could not get him to get enough protein in same thing with a lot of my clients just cannot get enough protein in and so today i'm going to show you how to make this super easy recipe so if you struggle with getting enough protein in or you want a super easy even healthy breakfast this one is for you so stick around let's do it to make this recipe you need your food processor you need [Music] bananas cocoa powder chocolate protein powder this will work with whey or vegan protein the ones that i have tried specifically because different protein powders have different ingredients some have more thickeners than others and that can change how this recipe comes out so listen up the two that i've tried it's the sprouts brand chocolate whey protein the sprouts brand chocolate vegan protein was fine and i've also tried the amazon brand whey protein like the amazon grass-fed essentials brand and i'll link all those below so those are the ones that i've tried and they're also linked in the blog post where this recipe lives that's where you can print this recipe but um yeah you need all those things and you need peanut butter you can use crunchy you can use unsalted not salted creamy you can use whatever you want and to be honest you can also use almond butter you can use whatever you want it's a really simple and customizable recipe so mr hungry most often likes for me to use salted crunchy peanut butter in this recipe so that's what i typically use but i think in the video you're about to see with overhead when i filmed this i did salted creamy peanut butter most likely all right so you blend all that up until you have a nice chocolatey mess and then you're going to fold in your chocolate chips you want to be super healthy use 60 or greater dark chocolate chips you don't care or you're just trying to move on with your life or you don't like dark chocolate then you semi-sweet milk chocolate's probably going to be a little sweet for this recipe but hey you do you you know i'm not judging so yeah so you're gonna fold those in and then it's that's it like you just pour it into a parchment line uh eight by eight baking dish and uh bake it for 30 or so minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] bring it out let it cool completely do not let it sit there in the fridge or on the counter overnight without covering it because it will dry out and um but then you can cut it into however many squares you want i usually do nine squares and uh it's perfect and delicious and it's freezer friendly you can freeze them i mean there's really nothing you can't do with them and they've got 20 grams of protein in them and they're perfect so let me know if you try this recipe leave a comment and also you can tag me on instagram at

say i'm sorry for not putting out videos in the past few weeks i want to give you videos that have thought put into them and you actually want to see so if you have any ideas for weekly videos maybe not weekly videos like whenever i put out videos i promise i will just give me some ideas to see if yours is picked then you can choose what my video will be for that week so let's get into the video happy valentine's day guys it's sid and welcome back to my channel today i'm going to be teaching you how to make some fun rice krispie treats that include four cups of rice krispies two cups of fruity pebbles a fourth cup of butter i use dairy free and one 10 ounce bag of marshmallows so what you want to start off doing is in a large bowl add four cups of rice crispies and two cups of fruity pebbles together the next thing in our rice krispies treat steps is adding in my fourth cup of butter melted over the medium heat sauce pan next i just added in all of my marshmallows and these were kind of the medium size they weren't super big but they also weren't the minis so here they are all melted and what i just did was i stirred them around for quite some time and you can see the progress it gets a little bit gooier here and then it starts to get more melty and then more melty and then more melty into our next step these ones aren't quite ready because you want all the bubbles and the actual shape to be melted okay for this step you want to work fast once your marshmallows are all melted down you don't want them to overcook or burn you just want them to be nice and silky and smooth and super quickly you're gonna add all of the marshmallows and butter into our fruity pebbles and rice krispies mix and just start mixing them together as fast as you can because you do not want them to harden too quickly because that would just be really clumpy but you want to make sure all of the bits and pieces are all mixed so if you look closely at the bottom some of them are not stuck with marshmallow but the goal is to get all of them onto the marshmallow in one big clump so next in a pan with some no stick cooking spray in i put my rice krispie treats and fruity pebble marshmallow mix onto it and put some saran wrap on top so we didn't get any germs onto it and just started pounding it down smushing all the air out of it so you get a nice big rice crispy bar and another thing i did was i did the same thing in a little heart-shaped pie tin foil pan so here's the finished product of all of them this is the little rice krispies squares after i put them up and cut them and then the heart so i hope you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to give me a little suggestion new video in the comments peace and love to you bye guys you", "Jr9cF82V5J8": "today Kevin inator and I are gonna be trying five different breakfast type bars these were bought in London we cannot get these in the United States which is so weird because we have Trix cereal and we have frosted flakes and we have cocoa puffs and that we have these cereals but we don't have these bars so that's totally weird so which one do you all want to try first we have wheat toast Frosty's bars cocoa puffs Bar tricks bar and a Kellogg's crunchy nut bar Thank You Vic how about the crunchy neck yeah Andrew says the Kellogg's crunchy nut bar I do not remember how much these cost the whole bar is 170 calories see if it's a chocolate and peanut you're on the food supply wars this is a chocolate and peanut more like him I'm not sure about it it looks really good anyhow I didn't fall apart or anything it just kind of looks all to the end that looks like a rosters okay take your pick yeah complan then you get some plain old peanuts mm a little bit of chocolate duck I don't mind it it wasn't bad the glaze is just this sweetness mm-hmm it's just wow it's not bad it's kind of bland I didn't know that at all I would eat that I don't packing peanuts I don't want another biomedis they are salty packing females there are other bars I would rather have for breakfast but if somebody picked that out for me then I would eat it I don't think there's anything wrong with it really you're tasting a lot of them it's like a rice krispie treat it's playing like that with some plain peanuts there's no way what well this is the wheat toast and it's made with real milk chocolate and it says 145 K Cups that's running right that's for honorariums it says it's a chocolate flavor to wheat hoop bar with a milk chocolate base you say poop it looks like chocolate rice krispies treats I see the hooves and they're they're like Cheerios they're calling on hoops they're like chocolate Cheerios actually I was how about dogs better nice wheel I don't like the chewiness and the Cyril do like the playground that's good I still like the marcelin though because I like the peanut flavor the first thing had a peanut flavor to make I think it's very very dry and I really don't like that chocolate flavor how about which one do you want right next just a little blame frost thanks Frosty's it is a hundred three calories know about it all it says toasted maize cereal and milk ball I wonder if they're great it looks good that it is it looks like two cereal it looks like frosted flakes that have cereal bars you remember them having cereal with a milk coating on the bottle milk always tastes a little strange that tastes like stale soggy sweetheart I like this my favorite so far Roy I actually like that ten it tastes just like frosted voice I like that that's very end that's a very good ball a lot of the texture I could eat one of those for breakfast okay that's a honey yes it's very good I'm gonna I'm gonna cause a picture of all these and I can't believe and you won't believe we don't get these in the United States that so what what bars doing in here but I follows the cheerio bar there's another bar that I love by fruit three petals yeah there's another one say though but I that out by all the time many grams turn the grant process or arms these are Coco Pops this is only 84 calories for this tubna pop it is chocolate flavor toasted rice cereal and milk bar so that's all you want this okay Russ crispy yummy let's see if they'll just winner then we drove we chose a toast No no it's not it sounds like that process of white one the other I don't mama it's a little wider it's not as drop the note on a chocolate is a wee bit better but still overall I mean I like I like that one I like the cocoa pop better than the wheat toast yeah that's what I'm saying yeah better than the we do stuff Oh or wait I don't I don't know do you think the windows has been of the burritos is no better chocolate oh this is the trick zero bar and it is a lot bigger than all the other ones it's 150 calories it it is a big bar and it just says it's a tricks serovar that's a Christmas tree oh it smells really good very colorful it's a very pretty bar which I think your kids would see that and probably go for it there's like oats in here some cereal it looks like some like big hunks of hold of cereal pieces where as bars here don't have those big hunks of of cereal one of them that's awful can taste verse tell you it's like a lemon got a funky lemon and it takes it's very uh get you up that trick taste which I never like tricks anyone and of troops definitely taste like they're very artificial yeah thank you for NOLA to hold it all together cause that's your yeah it's pretty bad it's pretty bad I don't like oh never to you here it's don't deserve it it's pretty to look at but yeah I don't like that the free coat ones there's a lot yeah yeah well we're so here I'm cinnamon toast crunch is one than a lie in the gram building great gold Renaissance for the only one I would give the time of day that of everyone I'm here rusty the frosty laughter I hate it at the right nose I sit down with us - yeah the Frosty's and then I like the cocoa puffs oh yeah I like that one - I like the reggienet but I would not buy the tricks or the windows again so I hope you all enjoyed getting to see they get to hear about them I will show you the picture at the end of them on the plate I'm just I still don't think it's weird that they doubt it's all in the United States because they can take all kinds of cereals that we can hear you know when they make this new finding nori cereal they can have finding Dory bars you don't know that cereal I'm shocked that they have it yet I really am i made a Captain America cereal they should have a Captain America bar because they would sell so in an in England right now the big thing over there are flapjacks we don't get black here they are a OD breakfast type bar this they're fantastic but they call on flapjacks they could put these cereals and all of those they people with love them over here I'm just shocked that they have it but anyway I hope you enjoyed the review helped you hopefully if you see these you'll know now which ones to avoid definitely avoid the tricks we all threw around that and thanks for watching", "FDZGyog-xFY": "Hey everyone! Sam here from Sugar Spun Run and today I'm showing you how to make s'mores cereal bars. I love this super easy summertime no-bake recipe for s'mores cereal bars. I've been making this for years, and of course have made some\nmodifications to the recipe along the way. Today I'm sharing my super simple\nversion. So let's go ahead and get started. Now you can make this recipe in\nthe microwave, but I much prefer to do it on the stovetop. So we're gonna head over\nto the stovetop and you are going to need a large pot. Now to this pot we are going to add five tablespoons of salted butter. 12 ounces, or two cups, of milk\nchocolate chips and 1/3 cup of light corn syrup. Now we're going to set our\nstove top to low low heat and we're going to stir everything together just until\nthe butter and the chocolate are melted. Once your chocolate and your butter are\nnicely melted and your mixture is smooth, you're going to want to add your\nmarshmallows. Now for this recipe you are going to need 15 ounces of marshmallows,\nwhich is actually one and a half bags of mini marshmallows. We are going to add\none bag directly into the pot. And we're going to reserve that separate half of\nthe bag, that 5 ounces, or about 2 cups, to use later. We're gonna stir these\nmarshmallows in until they're coated with the chocolate and they're beginning\nto melt, and then we're going to add our vanilla extract. You just need one\nteaspoon of vanilla extract. Now continue to stir everything together, and remember\nyou want to keep your heat on low. Do not turn up your heat, and you're just gonna stir everything together until the marshmallows are completely melted. Now we're going to want to add our cereal. You will need 7 cups of graham cracker cereal for this recipe. Stir this in until it's nicely coated with your\nchocolate marshmallow mixture. Now as soon as all of this cereal is\ncoated with chocolate you're going to want to add your remaining marshmallows.\nNow I usually don't add all of them. I usually only add about a cup and a half\nat this point. I like to reserve a few for topping. Now at this point, these\nmarshmallows we just added do not need to be melted. You just want them to also\nbe nicely coated with the chocolate and you want everything to be nicely\ncombined. Alright as soon as everything is nicely coated with chocolate, we are going to want to grab a 9 by 13 baking dish. You're going to want to lightly\ngrease this with butter. I just rub butter into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. We're going to pour our cereal mixture into this pan. Now use a spatula or a spoon to just smooth out this mixture. And grab those remaining marshmallows, and we're just gonna scatter them evenly over the surface These cereal bars are going to be a little bit messy while they're still warm. So you're gonna want to let them cool completely before you cut in, or if\nyou don't mind them messy, you can go right ahead and dig in. My preference actually is to put them in the fridge. I think they taste really good when they're cold. And that is how simple it is to make these easy s'mores\ncereal bars. I hope you guys enjoy today's recipe and if you try this one\nout, please let me know what you think. Thank you so much for watching and I\nwill see you next time.

Toady, I'm going to be showing you how to make homemade granola bars. I'll be honest I didn't originally plan on making a video of this recipe But my husband keeps asking me to make more of these the homemade granola bars So I figured I might as well record it this time. As you're about to see these are really easy to make. You only need a handful of ingredients and it's really easy to customize them to suit your flavor preferences The first thing you'll need to do is pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit Next, take a cookie sheet and line it with either a silicon mat or with parchment paper and evenly spread three cups of old-fashioned oats into the pan. Next, add one and a half cups of chopped nuts. I'm going to be using walnuts today. Now bake these on 350 degrees Fahrenheit. For about 10 minutes. Use a spatula to turn over the oats and the nuts and bake another 5 to 7 minutes until the ingredients Look nice toasty golden brown. Once they're toasted, transfer your ingredients to a large bowl and set aside. Now if you want to add dried fruits or coconut or anything like that, to your granola bars, add them now. I don't recommend adding more than 1/2 to 2/3 of a cup. Don't add chocolate chips or anything else that might melt at this point, we're going to wait a little bit before we add those. Any other add-ins are welcome. Today, I'm actually going to be adding 2 tablespoons of flaxseed to mine. Alright, now grab a saucepan and let's head over to the stove You're going to want to combine 6 tablespoons of unsalted butter, 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, 1/3 cup of honey, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt Heat these together over a medium low heat, stirring frequently until the sugar is dissolved in the mixture is smooth. Now remove your honey mixture from the heat and stir 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. All right, now we're going to pour this honey mixture evenly over your oats, Stir well until all of the ingredients are well combined and well coated by your honey mixture. Okay. Now we're going to let this sit for about ten minutes and let it cool a little bit before we add our chocolate. the The chocolate chips are going to melt a little bit once you add them But if we add them now, it just goes to be a completely, melty, chocolaty mess, so wait a little bit for it to cool. Once your mixture has cooled about 10 minutes, add 2/3 cup of mini chocolate chips and stir to combine. Now we'll press our granola bar mixture into a nine by nine parchment paper lined pan and use a spatula or the back of the spoon to press the ingredients firmly into the pan. We're going to top everything off with even more chocolate chips You'll need about a third to a half cup of mini chocolate chips, and drop these evenly over your granola bar mixture, and use your hands to gently press the chocolate chips into the tops of the granola bars. Okay, now we'll transfer this the refrigerator and let them chill for about one to two hours. Once they're chilled remove the granola bars from your pan and cut them into about one and a half inch wide pieces and they're ready to serve. These granola bars will be a little bit sticky even after they've cooled and you cut them, so one thing I like to do is wrap them in parchment paper, especially if you plan on stacking them on top of each other and storing them. That way they don't stick together. As I mentioned earlier, you can add in your favorite dried fruits or substitute your favorite nuts or even different kinds of chocolate. These are simple and very customizable and I think you're going to love them. I really hope you'll try out these homemade granola bars for yourself. And please leave me a comment Let me know what flavor combination you try it and let me know how you liked it. Well guys, thank you so much for watching.

286 uh bucks and you get six six bars in the hog they look when you when you look out they look like a five oh one box even the size of these that looks like a 500 babies that company so yeah General Mills might do 500 Martha I don't remember the only difference is 501 bars are fewer calories because these taste like from deep waters that I had to see I don't think so I like pebble and bars Kevin Bowe doesn't like them as much I do I like them quite a bit these are 100 calories each though whereas those I know we've tried some that are down to like 70 calories most 501 bars were like knowing me but then they make a 70 calorie line which people have told me they're really more than 70 calories but that's what it says this is no lekha marshmallow blondie that's blank at all okay I know what I think it tastes like what we're all sure cookie does I yeah I'll see that but I want really nice a tube of raw sugar cookie dough you buy and you slice up a bank it tastes like I mean even officer to me though it does and even the texture I'm very very plain okay so those guys didn't bother you and there's a little bitterness there okay because I'm not sensitive to two dies at all and food Kevin is and these there you can see the color in this I tasted a little bit yeah well you know what the roll sure could be honestly has a little bit of a bitterness to me anyway that's that takes down a lot of shirk but nothing reminds me of a like your job oh there's not one thing in there except maybe the colors now hmmm huh me up a Lucky Charms oh no that's what they should have said it looks like Lucky Charms because it tastes nothing like the cereal whatsoever I mean like zero nothing right so if you like a roll sure cookie dough then yeah zero zero zero is that yeah because we like the bars we love the natural snack bars the treats yes I'm not your treat yes I'm so much ball four so they still doesn't Meyer oh yeah that's not a verse don't oh that smells like that smells like cinnamon toast crunch um yeah okay so they make these soft papers but then they also make treat bars so they're long they're about this long and they're crunchy like they're like a granola bar but they're called treat bars so they make Lucky Charms they make cinnamon took to scrunch them Gramps the best yeah they're makin Golden Grahams anything they are they're awesome they really are good and they would baby do they think of three pebbles at one time and they do they better those are really good too these are only 90 calories that one's good mm-hmm that's the one you need about they still have the texture of what a raw cookie dough gosh that's good no there's a good learner has a good seaman it's does a little bitterness it I don't get that at all touch the bitterness my favorite part of these is there are you can see it better I think on the back this little dot there are little dots of cinnamon it's like hardened sugar yes it's hardened cinnamon and sugar I'm saying hard because it's crunchy compared to the rest of them those are the best part those are awesome no is no word about one to other links and like those loving they're delicious not really good I will absolutely keep those oh well honestly I'll keep on both because I do like the lucky charms bar but I don't like it as a lucky charms bar I like it as a sugar cookie bar no um so I didn't care for this they shouldn't though should not have the lucky charms night long these I like the cinnamon I can I can give it that we need to notice crunch you're expecting yeah so you're getting cinnamon you're getting what you what you want listen you're not getting cereal flavor you're not getting the marshmallow when it's an absolute out-and-out 100% alive that boxing I don't taste the marshmallows this is what I think they're selling is the marshmallows in it and I don't get the mark one more thing that's really interesting and this is probably only with the Walmart we went to hopefully nobody else's Walmart did this we was weird yeah you know what I'm gonna say we went down the bar out like we're all the nature of ours all that our and that is where we found the the cinnamon toast crunch don't living with that yeah that this was their this the these boxes and I was told Kevin I said oh they're supposed to have the the lucky charms bar and we looked and looked and looked and I always look up at the top you know to make sure they haven't stored the box but not put them down they happen and so I thought well I'll just get these we'll review these you know okay so we go down a thousand Isles and the last aisle would go down pretty much before we leave is the the bread aisle and down the bread and they have snack cake they have snack cakes so this is in a larger Walmart it's in the if you're in the Lexington area it's in the Hamburg Walmart is where I'm talking about so we go down where they have the bread and they have the little Debbie's in the hostess and all that and I'll be darned if those aren't sitting there and it's like oh and everything though Kevin said why in the world would they put it though those soft baked bars because these are like 501 bars you know they should have put those in the same aisle as these in the bar I guess is never so if you were in the Lexington area looking for these at the Hamburg Walmart those unless they have moved on bothered to unless somebody realize the error that's where they offer but I don't think you're gonna want those in a well unless you just want to sugar cookie flavor because if you're looking for Lucky Charms you needed your box of cereal or with oily treat bars yeah or the treat Mart the tree bars are seriously get bars so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "QxcVwkmVj4M":

have a four loko which I don't want to drink but um maybe I'll vlog at the party or something where is it don't worry though mm-hmm it's delicious this is cool we have this proof that Sylvia's alive [Music] [Applause] oh my [ __ ] so today is August 24th it's the next day we are getting ready to already know I have wearable more edibles and me and stills are gonna eat a little bit more because we're gonna go out and we figured out well we were like let me let me eat retrack let me let me track their steps and like think about how much we made and we realized the Fruity Pebbles had more marshmallow icing thingy on it so this one was hella stronger but yeah if you do this just be cautious of how much you're eating and yeah try to be careful but this one is bomb and so is this one the Oreo one I brought both just in case the only thing is they do get too sweet so like it's really hard to like keep docile me now cuz we cut them up really big so you gotta eat a lot and it just blows it it was kind of a good look for like once in a while so we put the buns this way they're her long kumtak we turn him that way that we estimated that each part was like baby milligram we think it was like a hundred milligrams each so yeah but they're so good and as soon as you take them like 20-30 minutes later and hits and then you feel high and yeah usually takes two hours for animals to hit so we're like an hour two hours to hit but this is really quick ah well you can see they're hella coated in the marshmallow icing I guess it's a month bomb to an edible during my first article mukbang and we made them that's gonna be this video yeah okay I'm eating a little bit of this that's my last piece because I'm gonna be too hard on it but we're checking into ours so this is probably gonna eat here soon yeah oh yeah I'm gonna go get water [Music] you", "l0WmrRBlyys": "today Kevin and I are going to be comparing the Millville fruit and grain bars to the Kellogg's nutrigrain bars the these are both blueberries the milk bill is an oldie brand they were a dollar thirty nine four eight bars at all day these were two ninety-nine Crowe a Kroger so big difference in prices they may have been as low as 250 if you think Walmart had that Walmart did not have anything but huge monster boxes did that gal they had like oh yeah you can had to buy the big family box with the Walmart Whitmer at or you didn't buy it at all I know well cheaper if you got into Walmart but not going 30 now in shape that's pretty tricky well let's compare some things on there they're blueberry blueberry and they're individually wrapped you get ain't ours let's compare some numbers on one bar is a header 1331 hundred twenty who says it'll make Grammys are more aligned nutrigrain is lower the boom on 37 grams this one's 37 grams so the new terrain is 10 calories one thing Wow the total fat is three ones thirty saturated fat is one month point Bob this trans fat is a brown road cholesterol is zero zero sodium is 90 mine's 110 it's a little more sodium on I don't know a cat trying to get him Oh laughs hello potassium is 105 I don't have potassium on carbohydrates is 24 total yeah 24 sugars is 12 right - protein is one month - and what's your doctor your father - two months three okay so there's little differences here and there Rodney is less calories and less fat yeah yours really sounds the nutrigrain sounds like it adds a little bit more sodium and a little bit more you're sad how much sodium 1:00 p.m. your Manhattan is 90 so it's on the road it would close yeah but for me for somebody if I know as me about calories you know 10 calories you know if he's always smell like food I guess you have to think about the price though as well yeah yep for them to be that close eater yeah you got if you have a family with a lot kids who go through these quickly if they want break it then that price really makes a difference okay now the millville is going to be this one and the new program is is this stuff bill bill nature [Music] okay there's what the tops look like it's a bottom there's a thickness and there's the filling so it's pretty pretty similar each other I thought which one do I smell first milvey oh it's very very soft hmm cook me oh hush I mean Mike hey girl I swear a baby could almost eat this make it count less because there's an economist missions away yeah there's just please go there it's just there's no harm texture hard edges anything like that it's all very very soft there's a lot of blueberry filling yeah the flavor is good it's not super overpowering but it's a it's a nice blueberry flavor yeah not curious if this one's gonna be stronger the textures different flawed Rory mm-hmm the texture of the nature friend wasn't it soft I mean it's still soft nice proud I'm good blueberry but the milk bill was so very very soft that round you know if that cooked for just 30 seconds longer it's gonna make the difference I don't get the blueberry flavor from the Nutri regulator though go ahead I know it does say stronger doesn't hmm the millville actually has a stronger blueberry flavor they're very close they're similar bearing edges out just a little bit take one more bite of the neutralizer at 200 they're very very similar so if you wanted to save some money I think I'll just go with a new dog and be done what yeah don't worry about the ten galleries yeah I think they're close enough to where you could say they're the same pretty much yeah really I do think Noble has just a touch more blueberry to it but but it's not by much it's just a little bit but the maybe that's where the next we think ours is coming from it could be for me they're they're so close that yeah yeah if you don't hear about galleries and most people don't let specially don't know yeah especially tan a dollar thirty minute I mean that's dirt cheap for a bar and they have all kinds of things that's quite new to Rome they have like an apple and I didn't see cherry because I love the cherry the cherry is my favorite major brain so if I could have compared them I would have compared to cherry but they think I didn't see them they're only saw at least at our Aldi I only saw the Apple Cinnamon I think it was and strawberry so you know if they have cherry in the future I would definitely get it though because I think it would be good yeah these yo so yeah save yourself some money and go to all if you have know so I hope you enjoyed the video I will have a picture for you at the end of what's left and thanks for watching [Music]", "WWHzW6PadtU": "welcome to episode 7 of mmm medical edibles I'm chef Tommy Nicole chef and culinary nutritionist looking looking you just beside the wall Soni in today's episode we're gonna learn how to make rice crispy treat we're gonna use rice krispies but you can use any of these cereals so cool today's episode is sponsored by black-market marijuana support your local ganja preneur a friend with weed is a friend indeed for your edibles you can use Keith's good ol mary-jane BHO or cannabutter if you have we're using cannabis that's the bottom rack did today's recipe only requires a few ingredients we have Rice Krispies cereal a 10 ounce bag of marshmallows you can use either mini marshmallows or regular-sized marshmallows we have some kosher salt some vegetable spray and if you'd like you can use food coloring I could use a little color let's start the recipe we need to find a way to get the weed to the paper [Music] we're gonna start really simple we're gonna turn our stove on to low I'm using my induction cooktop but if you're using the stovetop you just want to make sure you use a heavy bottomed pan and set your temperature on low some people don't like it as cold as I do but I don't care so I've already measured these this is our homemade cannabutter you're gonna use four tablespoons of your butter or a quarter of a cup you want to make sure your butter melts completely before you add the marshmallow make sure to spray your spatula with some vegetable spray that'll ensure that once you add the marshmallows it doesn't stick - looks like our canna butter is already melted we're gonna go ahead and open the marshmallows and put them right in what is this gluttonous monstrosity before me add a 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows or again regular marshmallows and if you happen to make your own marshmallows it's actually be about 12 ounces or a cup and a half let's go ahead and add these I know it looks like a lot of marshmallows but it definitely is going to melt down you want to make sure to continuously stir this once everything has melted we'll take it off the heat and we'll add the rice krispies cereal the reason why I use mini marshmallows is because I find that they melt a lot quicker than a regular-sized marshmallows you want to continuously stir it so that all the marshmallows melts evenly this is not the kind of thing that you walk away from you want to constantly stir it and watch it to make sure it doesn't burn now once this is completely melted we're going to take it off the stove and we'll add the rice krispies cereal at that time if you wanted to add food coloring you could or if you wanted to add any kind of chocolate chips or sprinkles or something like that you could do it at that time too now once this is done some people like to move the marshmallow mixture into a separate Bowl and mix the rice krispies into it but I've picked a large enough pan where I can just go ahead and add it directly to the pan and I definitely recommend that you want a nice wide pot so that all the rice crispy cereal fits into it and it's just easier to mix the marshmallows have completely melted I'm going to turn this off and pull it away from the heat and you got to say how many marshmallows he can fit into your mouth here we have 6 cups of rice krispies I'm just gonna add it to the marshmallow remember we've removed it off of the heat so we're gonna just put that right in there and to this I'm also going to add a quarter of a teaspoon of kosher salt anytime you make anything sweet or anything really when you add salt it really brings out the flavor in it if you wanted to you could add food coloring as well but I'm not going to whatever those rules aren't real and as you can see some of the Rice Krispies are dry and some of them are getting some of that delicious marshmallow so you really just want to work it let me work it so that all of the Rice Krispies cereal is coated with that yummy cannabutter marshmallow mixture that we made I want to make sure that all of the rice krispies are nice and coated a good indication of that is they kind of have a nice Sheen to it or shine what I see no more shines maybe you didn't hear about it you've been away a long time didn't go up that day and that's how you know that the marshmallow has covered every little last speck and that will have nice adhesion last thing you want to do is have your rice krispies treat fall apart on either no napkins or nothing you do like this you like that so again you can do this with any cereal Froot Loops fruity pebbles even Kashi if you wanted to do a healthier version ain't nobody got time for this so as you can see here everything is very nicely coated and what you want to do here is work fast we're gonna take this away and then we'll get a 9 by 13 pan that we will also spray with vegetable spray and we're going to put all those rice krispies right in there you want a normal size or a big fatty Oh every little inch of this you will really want to give it a nice coating because once the rice krispies is dry it'll make it easier to pop them right out pop pop pop pop now we're just gonna go ahead and sum all of this right in here really the part that gets tricky is putting this into this mold what I usually do is I start off with the spatula and then I will go ahead and spray my hands and press it in to the pan I find it does a better job so here we go all right and if you can see that makes it a lot easier with the [ __ ] dog man you can also do these in the sheet pan if you wanted to make thinner rice krispies and I have a rolling pin that I use and since the sheet pan is a lot flatter I usually just take the rolling pin and just roll it right over what the heck are you talking about these are what they look like when they're completely pressed into the pan and since they're still warm we're gonna decorate them with some sprinkles since it's 4/20 we're gonna go ahead and use purple in green light green sprinkles give it a nice green luminescent look to it and then we're gonna add some purple as well we've allowed the Rice Krispies cereal treats to cool down and what you're gonna do is you're going to either use a knife or I'm actually gonna use an offset spatula a what I want to do is you want to just Anderson it around the edges this should come out pretty easily since we already greased the pan I'm just gonna flip this over the Silpat that I have underneath it has measurements on it which will allow me to cut this fairly precisely fingers crossed oh it's fine that a serrated knife cuts it really smoothly so you want to try to cut them as evenly as possible it doesn't have to be perfect they're gonna taste amazing I wish that I could make a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat happy I finished cutting all the rice krispies treats if you'd like you can put them away by wrapping them individually in plastic wrap and that'll make them last longer in this house they won't last that long I just like to put them on a plate they look so delicious and they're really soft to the touch but they have like a nice stiffness to it well you know what we don't need to put this one on there there's plenty but I just want to show you here we have our delicious rice krispies treat 200 milligrams six of these you have this beautiful sheen from the marshmallow and the can of butter you have this nice denseness from when we pressed all those rice krispies together you still have a little bit of the chewiness and that give yeah Jesus Christ have you ever heard of

we kind of wanted to snack something just little bit sweet so we thought would make something that's really tasty we're gonna make some golden graham krispies treats let me show you how what we're gonna do we got our saucepan here we've put it on a low medium on your dial in your kitchen if you have a electric Kevin or still be played on a four of us are off with three tablespoons of butter I'm gonna knock that down just a little bit I love these things we've tried them of course with all different types of cereals we've done the Golden Grahams we've done the cinnamon toast crunch we're done the cocoa pebbles within the fruity pebbles but this is one of our favorites we're looking at lettera butter milk for just a few moments alright our butter has some melted we're now going to add one package which is ten ounces of miniature marshmallows I kind of started this well ground melt these you don't want to cook it too fast in college I used to love rice krispies treats and one of the things I used to do when I made it there as hard as a rock and one of the reasons I found out is because I was cooking them to work too fast and too long so my friend Julie she ended up making my mush crispy treats for me most the time because her she was so nice and soft and then she finally told me what I was doing wrong so we're gonna melt this down we're not gonna melt it all the way we want a few marshmallows left in it then we give them just a little texture I love the smell butter marshmallow of this as it's cooking right to this we're going to add six cups of Golden Grahams and we'll go ahead and start adding those in now you can tell it's not quite all right cooked or the marshmallows aren't all the way Nothe that's what's been what that section if you wanted to you can add a little bit of a few chocolate chips in here to make it more like a s'mores I just want kind of plain we've turned the heat off same reason because we want that gooey texture like a few marshmallows in it we're taking that 9 by 13 inch pan dissipated with a mom kit to cook a nonstick cooking spray I can't talk too clearly today alright we're gonna take this off the heat and stick it in our pan try to get that I mean I'm really good at making messes so try not to again we don't lay down the heat for too long it will make them too hard and crispy and we also like a few marshmallows not all they melted this spread it out a little bit cool if we're lucky or let it cool for about five minutes or ten minutes before we get in start eating it even though I have a feeling we'll start a little sooner this is how you make golden graham krispie treats and we hope that you enjoyed this recipe"}
